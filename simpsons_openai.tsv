Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?	Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note.
Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?	Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Oh.	Mr. Bergstrom left today.
And?	He's gone. Forever.
Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.	I didn't think you'd understand.
Me?	I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!
I don't think you realize what you're saying.	Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!
Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!	Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her.
Go Away.	Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy.
Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?	Go Away.
Nuts.	No!
This isn't going well at all.	Nuts.
No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.	Look, if you just want me to forgive you --
Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof.	No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
Oh.	That was our wedding.
It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?	Children, it's time for you to go to bed.
I can hold these nails in place with my tail.	Yeah.
Gimme a banana.	You're so silly.
Come on, you're holding out on me.	I don't have any banana.
Think nothing of it.	I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad.
Hey, what's the matter, son?	Think nothing of it.
Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?	Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted...
Would you have to do extra work?	No.
And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?	Yeah.
So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto.	Well, no.
Holy-moly... talk about parenting!	Hey! Thanks, monkey-man.
Uh oh.	Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three.	Uh oh.
Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.	Homie, did you straighten everything out...?
Mmm... hors doovers.	Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!	Homer! You promised!
Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.	Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.
Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah.	Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
How do I look?	Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Do we have enough gag ice cubs?	Do we have enough glasses?
What are all our friends names again?	Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Why not? I paid for it.	Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?
Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?	Why not? I paid for it.
Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.	Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor.
No.	Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?
Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?	Is that a new kind of Mace? It's really painful.
It was me! You fell for it!	Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink.
You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.	Please Dad.
Bart! Come over here.	You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?	What?
Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.	Yes sir.
That thing you know how to do.	What?
Go to bed.	What?
Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!	Go to bed.
I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve.	Oh, Homer, you're the king!
You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!	Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago.
All right then.	Uh, gee Homer, don't quit...
Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?	All right then.
Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.	Oh sure.
Why? What'd you do?	I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Marge!	Why? What'd you do?
Where-where are we going?	Come here!
The way I acted?	Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?
So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.	The way I acted?
I put it there.	Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
I slipped it into your glass as a gag.	You did?
I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.	Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?	I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.	No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?
I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.	I understand why. You were wasted.
Aw.	Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
Marge, Marge.	"Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including ""Bible Bafflers"", ""Satan's Boners,"" ""Good Grief! More Satan's Boners"" and, for the teens, ""It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."""
Sorry, Reverend.	I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
Hmmmm.	... or those just in need of a tune-up.
Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.	Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!	Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.
They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.	Now you wanna go?
Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth.	Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
No, you don't!	Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand.
Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.	Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it.
Hmmm, bait.	Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
Whoa, better get some gas.	Hmmm, bait.
Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.	Whoa, better get some gas.
Catfish Lake.	Where ya headed?
Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?	Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?
Oh yeah.	He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Whoa, who says that?	... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
Oh.	They do.
Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!	Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though.
None of your business, Flanders.	Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?
Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?	None of your business, Flanders.
Oh.	Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that.
I see. I also understand bowling expressions.	We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.	Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers.
Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress.	Homer, why are you here?
She's perfect.	No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?
Well, sometimes that can be annoying.	Come on, Homer. What are her faults?
I'm done.	Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn.
It's true. It's all true.	He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes...
Sorry.	Homer, don't interrupt.
I only did that a couple of times.	He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle...
Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime.	It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
Would this be a good time to be honest?	Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?
You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?	Yes.
No.	Get back in bed.
All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?	No.
Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.	Sure.
Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!	Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it.	Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!
Good! Give up!	For the last time, yes!
Huh?	Good! Give up!
Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show.	That the Yanks are comin'...
Whoa! Holy mackerel!	Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show.
I love you, but I must kill you.	Doggone it!
I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!	You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
Uh, oh.	I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?	Uh, oh.
Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero.	We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe....
To those weirdos in the worm store.	To who?
Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back.	All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Watch.	Oh yeah, sure.
Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby.	Watch.
We're back!	Ohhh, Homer.
Same as usual. Perfectomundo.	How's your marriage?
I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.	Ohhh.
I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!	Homer!
All right, what are you getting at?	All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!
A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?	I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Well, t.s.	Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?	Please Dad.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!	Okay.
Bart! What are you staring at?	Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever.
Bart! Stop it!	He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever...
Hey, what's all the --	So long, officers. Uh-oh.
My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.	Hey, what's all the --
What's the problem, boy?	Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her...
Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.	I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents.
Nah.	Really?
Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out.	Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps.
They're fine.	Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?
Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign.	Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do.
How many hairs on my head? Without looking!	Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot.
I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.	I don't wanna.
Sorry, sir.	You know, Homer, I am your supervisor.
Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?	It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap.
Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it.	A-Positive.
Earmuffs.	Sixteen permanent, eight baby.
Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.	Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?
Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!	Bart does.
Yeah, you have the right to remain silent.	Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know.
Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.	Is it a Bible story?
It was the olden days!	How did a lion get rich?
Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!	Oh.
Now let's get the show on the road.	Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude.
Eh.... the boy.	Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first.
Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!	Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?
Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!	Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed.
Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!	Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!
Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!	Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.	Yes, Dad.
"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""	The meaning of what?
"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"	"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place.	"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...	Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
Bart!	Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!
I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter.	We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"	I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter.
"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""	You stink.
An elephant's butt.	An elephant's butt?
Yup!	But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Forget it, Marge!	You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?
Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works.	Please, Homie? For me?
Cheap son-of-a...	Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works.
Hmmm...	Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph.	Hmmm...
Where's the letter?	Oh... thank you.
Where is it?	Where's the letter?
Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!	Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.
Bart, have you seen the letter?	Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!
All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?	Yup.
Uh huh.	The last place I saw it...
Yeah...	...was in my hand...
Why did you do that?	...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
I'll show you mad in the morning.	Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I...
She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!	Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.	She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!
Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy.	Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight.
What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.	Why the hose, Homer?
"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."	Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.	"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
That's a good one. We'll use that.	Dad, the mailman is here.
Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?	Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
Well, I'm still gonna run!	That's right.
Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.	Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired.
I don't know.	Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?
Great plan, Bart.	I don't know.
Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry.	Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron.
Oops.	"""Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results."""
Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.	Oops.
Homer Simpson.	Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?
Yeah, well I'll be on my --	"Simpson, eh? Simpson. Oh, why, there's a letter here from you. I'll just read it right now. ""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your card was just great."" Why, Simpson. You've made my day. You're a true gentleman."
Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?	"""...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..."" ""...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"""
Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad.	Nothing, sir.
Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means.	Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do.
I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.	What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Oh, woe is me.	Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
Mr. Burns, you brought us a present.	Wait, Dad, he's smiling.
What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...	It's to open the crate, stupid.
Marge, what does it do?	No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec.
Marge! Really, what does it do?	It doesn't do anything.
Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock.	Sir, you're my god of generosity.
Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!	"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.	Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Amen to that!	But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?	I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?	I washed it.
Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different.	Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!	Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts.
Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over.	Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
You! You did this to me!	Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!
Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --	It has pink frosting!
You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...	Let's go, Pinky.
Print name?	"Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the ""Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test."" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is."
Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form.	Print name?
All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it.	Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you.
Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?	All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it.
O-kay.	Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote.
No deal.	Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --
Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?	Dad, maybe you should do this.
Look at him!	"""Dog on Fire."" Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog?"
Awww.	"And finally, ""Baby With A Nail Gun."""
Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!	Okay, it's time to cast your votes now.
Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV.	"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!	"Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"""
So, did I pass?	"Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident."
The devil with his fly open.	Careful, men. He wets his pants.
That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.	Right...
Arrghh!	Good...
Who are you?	Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.
I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.	Hi. I'm Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons.
Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?	I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.
Doesn't ring a bell.	Michael Jackson.
What was that last one?	Thriller?
Nope.	Thriller.
Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?	Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE!
No, that thing with your feet.	The moonwalk?
Because I wore a pink shirt.	You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?
What'd you wear?	I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed.
Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--	One white glove, covered with rhinestones.
Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me.	Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis.
Okay. Five times nine.	Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that.
Wowww.	Forty-five.
Hey, Chief.	We call this guy the Chief. He's been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle.
Gee, I gotta call my family.	Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me.
Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god.	Gee, I gotta call my family.
Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight.	I could call them for you.
That's all right, son.	Hmmmm, lobotomy...
What's that?	Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty.
This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared.	What's wrong, Homer?
Pancakes... football... Boobies...	HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME.
Was the door locked?	Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn't leave the house. I just couldn't.
Was it raining?	No, I just couldn't face what was out there.
Were you out of gas?	Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work.
Baby.	Were you out of gas?
Mmm... pancakes.	You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord!
That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?	Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others.
Not insane.	Of course.
Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us.	I'm proud of you, Homer.
You are? Why?	Well, how about today? I'm only here voluntarily.
Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --	Joe's Taxidermy. You snuff 'em, we stuff 'em.
-- And smother you with kisses.	Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --
Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice.	Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose.
Are you sure you're here voluntarily?	Um Homer, I'm a vegetarian. And I don't drink.
Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.	And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital.
Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.	Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
Huh? Huh?	Huh?
Come off. I'm sane now.	I thought so. Oh, Bart, you...
Not me. I got this.	This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I'm a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin' good on this earth, so I kept on doin' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy?
"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"	Oooh!
Huh? A check?	"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
One Million dollars? I'm rich!	Huh? A check?
Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?	"Mr. Simpson, I can assure you this ""check"" of yours is non-negotiable."
Shut up.	"You see where it says ""VOID-VOID-VOID"" and ""This Is Not A Check""? ""Cash value one twentieth of a cent""? ""Mr. Banker, do not honor."""
I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.	Shut up.
Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now.	Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest.
Hey, a cartoon.	Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now.
"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."	Hey, a cartoon.
Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.	No, it is not the truth, Homer. It's well documented that women are safer drivers than men.
Nah, you go ahead.	Hey, Einstein. Put down your readin', it's lunchtime.
"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""	Hey, You don't wanna eat? What'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?
Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.	But irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear.
"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"	Important.
It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket.	"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
Those kids don't know what they're missing.	It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket.
We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.	Hey, what gives, man?
"""Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion."" He'll be killed!"	We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
Don't be so...	Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.
Oh, you're right.	Don't be so...
Hmph?	Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...
"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""	I thought you might want to snuggle.
Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask.	"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!	Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?
"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."	It certainly has enriched our lives.
Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --	Very.
Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine.	Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad.
YEAH! Damn right!	"""So burn the flag if you must. But before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car. Oh yes, and don't forget to burn your house. Because none of those things could exist without six white stripes, seven red stripes, and a hell of a lotta stars."" Thank you very much."
Uh-uh.	Are you a professional writer?
Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?	Lisa, after meeting your father, I've decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington!
Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me.	Yes, sir. Can I get you something?
We're all gonna die!	No.
Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi!	We're all gonna die!
BOOOOO!	Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS.
Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!	Homer, look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow.
Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off.	Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.	MOMMM!
Wake-up call? It's two AM!	Good morning. This is your wake-up call.
Free food?!	Sorry fatso.
"Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is ""How To Increase Your Word Power."" That thing is really, really, really good."	Lisa? I'm Faith Crowley, Patriotism Editor of Reading Digest.
"Miss? What does the ""I"" stand for?"	These are special VIP badges. They'll get you into places other tourists never see.
"Ah! What does the ""I"" stand for again?"	"Miss? What does the ""I"" stand for?"
Yeah, right.	"""On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to back-300 games."""
Mmmmmm... Money.	Oh, you have those damn badges. Okay, this tub was installed in 1894...
Lousy cheap country...	Folks, we print more than eighteen million bills a day. Oh, and in case you were wondering... no we, we don't give out free samples.
BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!	Lousy cheap country...
Hey, what's so funny?	BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!
Oh Marge, grow up.	Hey, what's so funny?
Who's that?	I'm too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial?
Bart, are you ready to go to... I'll room service you...	Thank you!
Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'.	Lisa, what's gotten into you?
Gimme one of those!	Extra! Extra! Feds nab rotten Rep!
Give her the check!	Miss Crowley, thank you for this over-sized novelty check. I would like to share this honor with all of my fellow essayists. Particularly the courageous Lisa Simpson, whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
I was serious.	Give her the check!
I'm almost done.	Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!
I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.	You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!
Well, why doesn't he just say so?	I think it means he's having a barbecue.
Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story.	He's trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance --
Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place.	We can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --
Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club...	Oh, Homer.
Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave.	And so the Saskatchewan Rough Riders, who scored only four rouges all last season, Jack, get the kicker they so sorely need...
What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que.	Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave.
Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!	What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que.
Hey, no tagbacks.	"Okay... Now you're ""it""!"
The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...	You lie like a fly with a booger in its eye.
That was a joke?	"Friends, we love you all, but I also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being Latin for ""left-handed."" But enough joking."
Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.	So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?
Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?	Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too.
Nah.	Oh, here, you two. Make a wish.
No, it isn't.	It's fun.
Hmm, let's see.	You must have something you want to wish for, Homer.
Nah.	Hmm, let's see.
Hmmm.	Nah.
Heyyyy.	Hmmm.
Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!	Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin'!
Ooooh.	Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!
Okay. Ready.	Mmmm -- too far.
Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!	Okay. Ready.
Oooh. That would be a shame.	No, no, no, don't say. Otherwise it won't come true.
Wouldn't it, Flanders?	Oooh. That would be a shame.
Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend.	Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology.	That sounds fine, Bart.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.	Well, if it isn't the Leftorium.
Hey Flanders, how's business?	Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
So, Flanders, have you sold anything?	Absotively posilutely.
I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?	Touch of death!
No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know.	Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?
Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?	"It's the German term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
Boy, those Germans have a word for everything.	Sour grapes.
Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.	So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today?
Ooh, the touch of death.	Uh, I learned the touch of death.
Hey, boy. How was class?	All right. Comin' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady.
Oh, that'll learn 'im.	Today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?	Pinking shears? Let's go to the Food Court and steal some baked potatoes.
Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.	Hey Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
Uh, well actually, Moe...	Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?
Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!	But Bart --
Homer Simpson, sir.	Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?
Can I leave, Mr. Burns?	"Oh! It's a real one! ""No more apples in the vending machine, please."" Well, that's almost a sentence!"
But the note was asking you to --	Oh, of course. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples.
Um, Mr. Burns...	Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
Sorry, Flanders.	Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here.
Huh?	Sorry, Flanders.
Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?	Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind.
Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!	Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?
I'll give you twenty bucks for it.	Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut.
You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it.	Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year.
Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!	Oh, Homer, be reasonable.
Twenty dollars?	All right, Homer.
Now I don't want it.	Twenty dollars.
I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.	What?
Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?	I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
Daddly-doodly.	Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly.
Only seventy-five beans!	Homer, this is the Flanders' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this?
Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many.	Good afternoon, sir, I'm Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency, and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills.
Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?	Oh.
Uh, there's a store where...	Damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...
Yeah.	Hey, you said you're Homer Simpson?
Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back.	Homer! Over here!
You're gonna live in your car?	Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up.
I know!	Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined.
Why not?	You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now.
Oh.	I sold it to you for seven cents.
Oh, it's all my fault.	You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me.
Yes it is.	No it's not.
No, I was a swine.	No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend.
Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?	No, I was a swine.
Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!	For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
I SAID DO IT!	Oh, Homer, there's no point...
Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me.	I SAID DO IT!
C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?	Hurry, Neddie, hurry! Oh golly, it's a miracle!
It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right.	Homer?
To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.	Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends.
Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!	No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart.
That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh.	Hey, that's my badge, Homer.
How much does it pay?	Bart, your father and I don't want you doing that. Homer, say something.
Pfft. I make more than that.	Thirty bucks a week.
... Bart! Have you started smoking?	Good for you, Chief.
Don't lie to me boy.	No.
Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought.	Don't lie to me boy.
Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn...	They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
Son, I'll never doubt you again.	Hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. Kind of sophisticated.
A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal.	The kiss of death. That's all I need!
See? It was all your imagination.	Let's roll.
Oh, all right.	Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?
Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes.	Oh, all right.
You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter.	I am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.
Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding.	Homer, what did you find out?
Kill my boy! Kill my boy!	Yes, Bart. ... There there... there there...
Wait till I get you home, boy.	Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys.
Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit.	Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?
I thought he was dead.	Principal Skinner!
Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple.	To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
Hey, when do we get the check for this?	Cool!
You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.	Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us.
Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate.	You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.	Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King.
What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.	Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time.
Huh? Noise. Bad noise!	Thank you, President Ford.
Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it.	Five minutes before critical mass.
Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!	Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it.
Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT.	Homie, please be all right.
"Uh-huh. It's as fat as a phone book! ""Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow Fission Reactor. Get to the point, man! Ooh, what's this?"	Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT.
Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!	"Uh-huh. It's as fat as a phone book! ""Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow Fission Reactor. Get to the point, man! Ooh, what's this?"
I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!	Wheel of Fortune!
Shut up!	One minute to core meltdown.
Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!	Shut up!
Okay, okay, think back to your training...	Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!
Yes.	Now Homer, this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer...
Ooh, a side.	Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button.
What?	Simpson?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it.	Do you see which button I'm pushing?
This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!	Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it.
Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe.	Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button.	Yeah, we owe you one.
Magic Johnson! Y'ello.	"And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson."
Yeah.	Is this really Homer Simpson?
Well, thank you.	Wow. Homer, I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust.
Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?	I don't care.
Thanks, Magic.	Don't worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.
Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home.	A role model in my very own home. How convenient.
It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!	How are you enjoying your ham, Homie?
What's your problem, boy?	Maybe you ate a clove.
That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.	I had a fight with Milhouse.
What? What is it? What are you doing?	How Zen.
Well, as long as it's quiet.	Looking at you with quiet awe.
Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it.	Milhouse to Bart, Milhouse to Bart... Please don't hate me. Please?
Huh? Wha?...	Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility.
Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?	They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!
But I really can't tell them anything, sir.	We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons.
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?	"He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."""
Did it work?	Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...	Poor guy.
Um, Grace under pressure is no...	Just picture them in their underwear.
Whew! Saved by the bell.	Three minutes to meltdown.
All right.	Just do what you did before.
Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe.	All right.
Sure. Moe.	Thank you Homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. Do you even know what button you pushed?
You think it's him?	God bless that clown.
What are you talking about? Of course he does.	"Krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
We could have seen a monkey.	Go wait in the car.
He's talking funny talk.	Well, alright. I'm a little rusty, but um, I'll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz.
A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.	No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish.
Mel Brooks is Jewish?	Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks.
Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?	Yes, it's just that saying the brucha brings back a lot of painful memories. The old days... my... my father...
Yeah, Krusty, tell us.	Come on...
Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.	Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father.
Why you little...	Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
No, that's it. You've seen everything.	Do you have any yearbooks?
Gladly.	Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home.
Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia.	And, to conclude this Halloween newscast on a scary note, remember: The presidential primaries are only a few months away.
Hey, aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes.	Trick or treat, man.
Here you go, kids. Lousy punks...	Hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house back to the stone age.
Get a good haul this year?	We're home!
I am very, very proud of you kids.	Heh heh heh...Jackpot!
I'd like to see that.	Oh yeah, three bad nightmares.
What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?	I'd like to see that.
Eeuhgh. What is this thing?	I can do that but I don't wanna.
Oh yeah? How much?	It is a monkey's paw, dating back to Allal ben Abdallah. It has the power to grant wishes to its owner.
C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!	Sir, I must strongly advise you do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I myself was once President of Algeria...
Why at that little shop, right over... there.	Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing?
Oh no, wait, it was over there.	Why at that little shop, right over... there.
Okay.	You must pay a fine of two American dollars.
Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish.	Peace on Earth.
Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true.	Homer, there's something I don't like about that severed hand.
Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie.	Oh, my land!
Now you're talkin'!	Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous.
Woo hoo!	Yaaayyy!!
C'mon, everybody. We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!	Woo hoo!
Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful.	Oh Homer, this is awful.
Lisa, that was very selfish of you.	I wish for world peace.
Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?	Jeez, now we're slaves. This paw sucks.
Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey's a little dry. The turkey's a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?!	Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?
Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh.	Hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?
I wish I had a Monkey's Paw.	Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead.
Hiya Bart!!! How's my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh.	Good morning, dear.
It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good.	Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire!
He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side.	Okay.
Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.	I love school.
Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks.	I want to watch Krusty.
Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh.	Yayy!
I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.	Homer, I see you agree with my theory.
Ouch!	Well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him.
Good night, son.	Ouch!
Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.	Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you.
Oh, ah, thanks boy.	You got it.
I love you, son.	I love you, dad.
You both toilet-trained?	Can we sleep with you?
Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work.	Yes!
Huh? What?	Attention Homer Simpson. Attention Homer Simpson. Wake up, Homer.
For what?	You're fired.
How do you know I was sleeping?	For sleeping on the job.
Camera?	We've been watching you on the surveillance camera.
How hard can it be?	Hey, here's a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor.
Ooo, what job is that?	Hey, Dad. Here's one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people.
Sheesh. What a slave driver.	Deeper. Wider. Faster. I wouldn't bury me turtle in that mud puddle. Ah, what's the use?
No. Bart bit me.	Did you have a nightmare, Homie?
I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.	Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!	Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
Umm. Spaghetti.	Don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner.
Oh, I hate having two heads.	But Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands.
Y'ello.	Ahhh.
Don't worry, I know it's tonight.	Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show.
Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?	No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one.
Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.	I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.
Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?	Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet.
Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes.	Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?
Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?	Why don't you go there first?
You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top.	Sorry, Homer.
Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.	Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I'm not kidding.
The moron next door closed early!	What's the matter, buddy?
Oh, me and my trenchant mouth.	I happen to be that moron.
"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!"	Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year.
Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one.	Let me think about it... Eh... No.
I'll have you know, I wrote it down.	Okay. Okay. But now we're even. So what does your daughter need?
Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!	I'll have you know, I wrote it down.
Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!	Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
I dunno.	Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play?
No.	Clarinet?
No.	Oboe?
No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?	Saxophone?
Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father.	Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawnmower.
Uh-oh.	Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father.
Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!	Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax.
I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.	Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache?
That cost eighty-eight dollars!	I'm done.
Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.	I'm sorry dad, I don't feel much like eating.
You didn't mean that!	I forgive you.
No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.	Did you hear that, Homer?
Okay.	Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her.
Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie.	Okay.
Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.	Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you.
Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.	We can't afford to buy a pony.
Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore.	That's ridiculous.
See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes.	That's no reason to buy a pony!
Ha ha, you love me.	Stick to the subject.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Let's be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
Mm.	You sound like you're going to buy a pony. Promise me you won't.
Buh.	What was that? Was that a yes or a no?
Sneh.	Those aren't even words!
Excuse me, do you sell ponies?	Oh, it's you.
"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!"	Uh, sure pal, right here.
Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs.	My friend, you're smarter than I gave you credit for. I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401. Merely take a left at the rendering plant.
Half a million dollars?!	Very good. That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.
Wow!	He was sired by Seattle Slew and his mother won the Kentucky Derby.
I'll take it!	His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania...
Uh, sure... let me write you a check.	Mr. Simpson, do you have half a million dollars?
Is there a problem with that?	Mr. Simpson, this check is dated January 1, 2054.
Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?	Our ponies start at five thousand dollars. Cash.
I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.	I sincerely hope not.
Mr. Burns, you do this personally?	Simpson, eh? How can I help you?
U-su-ry?	It's a hobby. I'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?
I want to buy a pony.	Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan?
No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.	Isn't that cute? Smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it?
Sorry.	Shut up, Simpson.
Of course.	Mr. Simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony?
Simpson, you've done it again.	Of course.
Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.	I am very upset with you.
Because she stopped loving me.	Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?
I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.	I don't love you either. So give me a moped.
I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.	Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?
That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me.	That's illegal.
Stable? That sounds expensive.	Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable.
This is what love costs a month?	Stable? That sounds expensive.
Oh nuts.	Father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived.
I was hoping it'd be money.	Wait, Dad, I've got something for you.
Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have.	Hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.
Nah, we're not gonna be doing that.	Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer.
First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind.	Then I'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays.	Homer...
Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it.	All right. You got us into this, you get us out.
Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?	Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it.
Need money. Need money.	Oh look. You haven't touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick.
One Scratch-for-Cash, please.	Need money. Need money.
Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu.	Here you go.
Thank you.	Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer!
There it is.	If I could just see the ticket...
No.	Please to be removing your thumb.
No! No!	Yes. Please, I must insist...
No! You can't see... come on!	I've got to look at the ticket
No!	Yes, I must...
Let go. You're ripping it.	No!
Ohh... I need money.	A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?
You're looking for help?	"Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my ""Help Wanted"" sign."
I'm your man!	Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift.
Woo-hoo!	You're hired.
...Badge of honor.	Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.
But I eat... Oh.	Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There's only one bozo who comes in and buys them.
Heh heh, the perfect crime.	But I eat... Oh.
Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it.	Homer, where have you been? I was so worried.
I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.	Busted!
Mmm... salty.	Oh my God, she killed him.
No sir.	Homer, are you stealing Squishees?
Yes sir.	Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.
I don't know. How long do horses live?	Homie, how long do you plan to do this?
Y'ello.	Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?	I just called to say I love you, Dad.
Going for... eight hour walk.	Hey, Homer, where ya goin'?
Homer sleep now.	Going for... eight hour walk.
Coming right up, sir.	Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today.
Yes, sir.	And fill it to the top this time.
Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money...	Dad, you don't have to do this.
You did?	Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony.
Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!	Hmmm hmmm. There's a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse.
Awww.	I mean you, you dummy.
Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!	Awww.
That baby changed our lives.	Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Doam...the Jet Walker...Mr. Sugar Cube...
Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.	Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm.
In the garage.	Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?
Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.	I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.
If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.	Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.
Okay, okay, calm down.	Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five.
Okay, I will. I will.	Homer, be nice.
Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise.	Okay, I will. I will.
... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah.	No, next to him. Mary... Tyler... Moore.
Shh! They'll hear you.	Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?
I don't know. Some guy I guess.	Who's using the power tools?
Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- Did you hear that?	Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone.
How much?	Yes.
What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?	Everything.
Anything for my little girl.	Uh... take us to the video store.
Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.	Anything for my little girl.
Ooooooh, McBain.	Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
Why? I just saw the best part.	You want to rent it, sir?
"Oooh, ""Death by Knockout,"" ""Blood on the Ice"" Oh, oh... ""Football's Greatest Injuries"". Lisa, we're going."	Why? I just saw the best part.
Just grab something. All these movies are great.	"But, Dad, I can't find ""Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town""."
Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.	Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take.
Oh Marge.	This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.	"Question one: ""Name one of your child's friends..."""
Okay. Hank.	They want a name, Homer, not a vague description.
Hank... Jones.	Hank?! Hank who?
Steve McQueen.	"Homer, you made that up. Question two: ""Who is your son's hero?"""
Next.	"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.	What are your son's hobbies?
Then he has no hobbies.	He hasn't done that since he was two.
Bart!... BART!!!	Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see.
You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?	What?
Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?	No, not really.
Oh, that's a hobby!	Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!	Hey, so it is.
I'm also fat!	You're also fat.
I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.	National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking.
Goodbye, son.	In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel.
Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.	"For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of ""Fatherhood"" by Bill Cosby."
Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?	Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.
Huh?	Homer, meet Dave Jr.
Oh, how I envy you!	Thanks, Dad.
I've never been afraid of a little hard work.	Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort.
What boy?	Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?
Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.	Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.
Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.	Dear God! Not again.
Okay. No, I'm gonna do it.	Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?
But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.	Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help.
What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you.	But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.	Come on Dad, it'd be weird.
"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"	Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Oh, that sounds too complicated.	"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you.	Oh, that sounds too complicated.
Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!	Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes.
You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.	Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!
This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!	I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet.
Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!	Hey, Simpson, where's your loser-mobile?
Are you nervous son?	You didn't hear nothin'.
Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...	Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it.
Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson.	Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...
When did I ever teach you that?	Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win.
Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad.	Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but...
"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."	Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad.
Ow.	"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
Why? What's wrong?	Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?
Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?	Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.
Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!	Tell me something I don't know.
No!	Dad, aren't you coming?
I'm not pouting, you are.	Now, don't pout.
Sorry.	Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge.
No. Can't think of a thing.	Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
Leave me alone.	But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.
"""Name your son's hobbies."" Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."	In just minutes, these junior Al Unser Juniors will lock horns.
Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!	"""Name your son's hobbies."" Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."
"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""	Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!
Shut up Flanders. Flanders!	Hey ho Simpson.
Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?	Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
Great, thanks.	Well sir, there are two schools of thought...
I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!	Great, thanks.
Do it for your old man, boy!	Forget about your father. You're driving for me now!
No, son, you earned it.	Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad.
That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!	Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
Wow, infotainment.	Hello, I'm Kent Brockman and this is Eye on Springfield.
He's not so fat.	...We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man...
Bart, why are you still up?	Whoa, T and A.
Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego.	Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
What is it, boy?	Coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush!
Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man.	What is it, boy?
Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?	Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man.
You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh.	Ow! What was that for?
Run for it boy!	There he is! Let's give him a make-over.
That's it. I'm outta here.	Come here, Maggie.
What's the matter, Moe?	Hiya, Homer.
Yeah, things are tough all over.	Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.
Could I get a beer?	Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself...	Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?
One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.	Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself...
As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink.	Aye carumba!
Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?	As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink.
In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.	I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.	In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.	They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom.
"A ""Flaming Homer""."	Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?
Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?	"Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of ""Flaming Homers""?"
Try lighting it on fire.	It's not without its charm.
"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."	Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?
Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?	I'll be back.
Why yes I --	"Pardon me, are you the genius behind the ""Flaming Moe""?"
I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!	Honey, what's wrong?
Take that off this second!	I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
Nah... Marge, I'm too upset to eat -- I think I'll go to Moe's. .	Homie, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you.
I need to talk to Moe.	Can I help you sir?
I didn't even tell you my name.	Your name's not on the list.
Homer Simpson.	Okay, what's your name?
But--	Not on the list.
Barney?	AND I TALK TO MY DAD, HE SAY/ HE SAID, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' TILL YOU'RE DOWN ON A MUFFIN AND YOU'RE SURE TO BE CHANGIN' YOUR WAYS/ I MET A CHEERLEADER WAS A REAL YOUNG BLEEDER OH THE TIMES I COULD REMINISCE/ TO THE BEST THINGS OF LOVIN' WITH HER SISTER AND HER COUSIN AND THEY STARTED WITH A LITTLE KISS/
You're my kid's teacher!	Hiya, Scrumptious. Do you want to ignite my drink?
No!	Single parent, are we?
Get away from me.	Well, let's pretend you are.
Hey, Moe?	Get away from me.
"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."	Oh, hiya, Homer. How 'bout a beer?
How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it.	A what? Oh, I get it.
If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise.	How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it.
Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!	Homer, I'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. This is business.
I said, you just lost yourself a customer!	What? I'm sorry. Homer, I couldn't hear you.
You just lost yourself a customer.	What?
You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!	Homer, you're gonna have to speak up!
You just lost yourself a customer.	I lost myself to what?
You just lost yourself a customer.	Homer, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Ah, my new watering hole.	I got hooked on this stuff in the service.
A beer?	Yeah, what do you want?!
Can I have a clean glass?	Okay, then.
Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...	Well, this all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of '78. How about that? I looked something up! These books behind me don't just make the office look good, they're filled with useful legal tidbits just like that!
Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!	Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.	Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!
Moe... Moe... Moe...	Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas.
Moe... Moe... Moe.	I moe, I moe.
Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe...	Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.
"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."	What the...
Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!	Homer, no!
Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?	Hey, Homer, come in here.
Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.	Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here.
I guess so.	Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.
Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have.	"Compliments of the house. One ""Flaming Homer""."
Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?	Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have.
Oh, what do they want!	Yes, yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl.
It's not fair!	I'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir.
Uh-huh.	I know how you feel, Simpson. I've never seen Mr. Burns so depressed.
Ooh, that's a lot of money.	People think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. But he does. And you know what? I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars.
Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?	Ooh, that's a lot of money.
Homer Simpson here.	Good, good. Try to eat something.
I own stock?	Homer, it's your stockbroker. Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years.
So uh, how much did it go up?	Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights.
Yeah...	Wait a minute. Let's not do that yet. The book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. Everybody alive?
Sure...	Like any sports?
Not any more...	Ever go dancing?
That'd be great.	We should get together sometime.
Well... how are you?	There. Now we trust each other.
Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?	Near death. I'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis.
What should I do?	Twenty five cents a share.
Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!	Well, let me put it this way. You'll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now.
Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer...	Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve.	Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?
For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy.	No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve.
Have a Duff, boys!	For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy.
Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?	Yeah, but thank you anyway.
Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars.	We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?
Hey... hey!	We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on.
You heard?	Oh, Homer!
Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too.	We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.
I spent it on beer.	What do you mean?
Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?	You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.	Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?
Ow!	What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
Did you buy this car with your stock money?	Hey, Homer.
We could all lose our jobs.	Ich bin ein Springfielder!
Well, they can't fire me.	Well, they can't fire me. I'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier.
Cuz... I...	Why?
Lucky drunks.	You'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in Hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay.
Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!	We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?	Well, first I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell!
Good, good, I'm learning.	Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?
Because we send them money?	One of the economic powers of the world--
Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it.	Homie, come to bed.
Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing.	Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow.
Ooh, Battlestar Galactica.	Well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?
Fit, damn you! Fit!	Ooh, Battlestar Galactica.
There.	Fit, damn you! Fit!
Huh? What?	Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work.
Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up!	Huh? What?
No.	Homer, could we have a word with you?
No!	I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?
Auugghh!	We request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas.
Uh... all of them?	You've been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?
I sure do!	I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy.	Such as...
Mmm. The land of chocolate...	We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate.
Wow. Chocolate -- half price!	Mmm. The land of chocolate...
La la la la la...	Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
La la la la la la...	Mr. Simpson...
Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?	Mr. Simpson...
I think I did pretty good in there.	That was ten minutes ago!
Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing.	I want you to take baths, Bart.
No problems here.	Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing.
I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!	"Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my ""buddy"" here."
That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.	Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated.
Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?	That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?	Yes.
"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""	Why, no.
Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!	No, it doesn't.
Nobody loves you...	Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!
Na na na na / Na na na na /	That was no accident. Let's get out of here.
Woo-hoo! I got my job back!	And then one day... when he least expects it --
But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe.	"""Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test""? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?	"Okay, let's see... ""Ahoy maties! If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?	"""If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". Well, I guess I'd better go see Dr. Hibbert."
Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get.	Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids.
No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg.	Is anything wrong?
Maybe.	Is Mom gonna have another baby, Dad?
Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.	Ohhh, cool, we can race them.
Yeah, but I have to hear about it.	Doesn't Mom do that stuff?
Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s.	Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?
Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!	Hmmm, what do you think about?
For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.	Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!
Yes, sir.	That's better. Ah, beautiful. Keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters.
I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future...	Yes, sir.
Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!	I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future...
Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh...	It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV.
Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.	Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh...
Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.	Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.
You mean like will apes be our masters?	Homer, do you ever think about the future?
But it gives me time to think.	No, I mean how you plan to earn a living. I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.
Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!	But it gives me time to think.
Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father.	I think about you, too.
Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda.	Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father.
I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.	Our song.
Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad.	Actually, she was singing about God.
Someday I'll buy you a real castle.	Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad.
Phew, good.	You don't have to do that.
Really? It must be the Champale talking.	Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy.
Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!	What if we get caught?
Pass the cookie dough.	Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
Why? What's wrong?	I need you to drive me to the doctor, Homer.
Oh.	Well, that unforgettable night we... joined the Castle Club...
... ...	Well, Miss Bouvier. I... I think we found the reason why you've been throwing up in the morning. Congratulations.
Because it's the honorable thing to do?	Son, you gotta marry that girl!
Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal.	No, because you'll never do any better. You lucky bum! The fish jumped right in the boat. All you gotta do is whack her with the oar.
Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?	Well, I haven't said no to you lately, have I?
Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.	What card?
What's it say?	Is this it?
That's the card. Give it here.	"""Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don't have much to offer you... except all my love. Will you marry me?"""
So... will you marry me?	Oh, Homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!	Yes.
You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago.	Kool Moe Dee.
Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy.	Homer, I've been thinking. If the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name Larry?
They'll call him Screwy Louie.	Well, how about Louie?
Slob.	Bob?
Puke.	Luke?
Mucous.	Marcus?
Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!	What about Bart?
I don't know.	Yes sir, and how will you be paying for it?
Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line.	I don't know.
Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.	Be sure to get this punched every time. The tenth wedding is on the house.
Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place.	There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
I am?	Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband.
Homer.	Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino to join...
I do.	Homer, same question, names reversed.
Our first night together as man and wife.	What a perfect day.
Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor.	Hey! Lovebirds! Keep it down!
Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over.	Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor.
Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well.	Homer, I don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary.
Pfft. Now you tell me.	I don't know. I heard radiation can make you sterile.
Dear Marge, XXX. Homer.	I push myself too hard.
Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I'm kind of a goof-off...	Dear Marge, XXX. Homer.
... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.	Okay, that'll do.
There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!	That's enough! Next: there's a problem with the reactor, what do you do?
Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life.	Did you get the job?
Wow! Kid, I won't let you down.	Oh, Homie. Hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking.
I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job.	Wow! Kid, I won't let you down.
... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold.	Yeah, the doctor.
Oh!	... You, gentle sir, are fired!
Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co.	Oh, hello, young man.
Handle first, handle first...	Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co.
I quit! I quit!	Handle first, handle first...
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!	Hey, who wants to get rich today?
I don't know, I don't know --	"""Fourth Notice""... ""90 Days Overdue""... ""We Break Thumbs""... Homer, what are we going to do?"
"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""	Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.	Shut up with that pen-scratching down there!
Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household.	That is so sad.
Okay.	Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?
Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...	Marge, listen... We just saw...
They get donuts?	Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...
Wowww.	That's right. All the colors of the rainbow.
Yeah, what do you want?	What the hell. Marge I've got two-and-a-half words for you. Gulp 'N' Blow.
You want fries with that?	My husband by my side.
Marge?	Homer?
Marge!	Homer!
Holy cow, you're as big as a house.	Marge!
No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.	Homer... Come home with me.
Marge, for you.	Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
Oh, sure.	Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.
Because I knocked you up?	Homer, do you know why I married you?
You the boss?	Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive.
Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!	I'll call security, sir.
Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!	Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
You mean?	I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.
I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!	Welcome aboard, son.
Marge!... Marge!...	Simpson, eh? I'll remember that name.
The hospital?	You're a little late. She's gone to the hospital.
Thanks, mom.	I'll drive you.
Marge! Marge, where's the baby?	Don't ever call me that.
Shut up!	Right where you left it.
No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!	Hey, listen fatboy --
Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!	Homer, does this mean --
And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!	Good God.
Eh, somebody'll cover for me.	Doesn't your job start tomorrow?
Oh, college boy, eh?	Uh, why don't you let me handle it, Homer?
Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.	Homie, isn't he beautiful?
Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel.	Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.
Why you little... He did that on purpose!	Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel.
Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute...	How could he? He's only ten minutes old.
Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have.	Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute...
As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more.	Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have.
And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you.	As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more.
Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge!	Homer, I'm not pregnant.
Aw, ain't that cute... Hey!	Yes!
Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of... daaaanncciinng!	Aw, ain't that cute... Hey!
Mon-ey.	Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present?
Oh, sorry.	Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars.
That could be Bart!	WE'RE GONNA ROLL THIS TRUCKIN' CONVOY / CROSS THE U.S.A. / CON-VOY...
He's in for some lovin'.	Hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later.
Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.	You're fired!
Limited?!	But order now, supply is limited.
Do you have any of those microphones left?	Limited?!
Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet.	Yeah, a couple.
Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!	Ehhh...
There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.	Now we can be twins!
Hey boy, how's the microphone working?	There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.
Bart! I would love to get a present like that.	Fine.
Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch.	Here you go. Enjoy.
WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY	Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch.
Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!	Quit it, Dad!
Mmmmm. Chocolate.	Hmmm.
Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream.	Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Mmmmm. Chocolate.	I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer.
Why, you little...	We have captured your president. He was delicious.
Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?	Why, you little...
Aww...	Uh-huh.
Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.	Aww...
Hey, what's up?	Sucker.
Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero.	Bart! What's wrong with you?
Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...	How do you mean, dad?
Well, it's more than you did!	How does that make him a hero?
You must think we're the worst parents in the world.	So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.
Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll...	Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station.
Hey, don't make me come down there!	Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Why, you little --	Like to see you fit.
It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident.	So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
Uh, could you edit that last part out?	Homer!
Don't worry, you'll grow into it.	Mom, it's too big.
That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself.	You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair...
Shh! Marge, he's a good digger.	Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--
Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.	Man, I was so scared.
Well, bye-bye belt.	Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
Pfft, my heart is just fine.	Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart.
A little beer will put out that fire.	Pfft, my heart is just fine.
Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!	But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver.
Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver.	Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
Twenty big ones on Denver.	Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster.
All right, Denver. Justify my love.	Pleasure doing business with you, H. S.
Lousy, stupid Denver.	DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.
Why did you do that?	Ho, look at that score. Moxy!
Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there.	Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
Over.	Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there.
Over... over... over...	Over.
Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer.	Over... over... over...
Why didn't you say that before!	Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time.
Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy.	"I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's ""Lock of the Week."""
Huh, they both make a good case.	"In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my ""Shoe-in of the Week""."
Yeah!	You want some of this don't ya?
Line...	You have reached the Coach's hot...
Yeah, lay it on me, coach.	line.
Mm-hm.	In the game of Mi-a-mi...
Cincinnati...	...versus Cin-
Cincinnati.	cin-
Cincinnati.	nat-
C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?	ti...
Doh, not the wind.	We must consider many things. The wind...
Oh...	...is blowing out of the west...
... miles per hour.	at five
Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?	knots...
Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins.	Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?
All right, Dolphins!	Touchdown Dolphins!
Whoo-hoo!	All right, Dolphins!
Fifty big ones!	Whoo-hoo!
Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game.	Fifty big ones?
Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting.	You mean you made a bet?
Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?	What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...	See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us.	So gambling makes a good thing even better.
YEAH!	And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10.
You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible.	Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars.
Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?	Really, where?
You bet.	Did you two have fun?
Me too, honey.	Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today.
Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.	Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?
All right!	This team is fired up! We came here to play!
What? Didn't you hear what he said?	He'll lose.
You think we should bet against them?	Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men.
You got it.	I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York.	You got it.
Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?	Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous.
My daughter, that's who!	Oh Doctor, what a finish! The final score -- Atlanta seventeen -- Houston thirteen. And the lowly Falcons are flyin' high. Who would have thunk it?
Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift.	Yeah, me!
Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.	C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.
Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.	You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.
The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills.	Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.	Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars.
Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.	Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer.	Hello, I'm Marco. I'll be your waiter.
Oh, violin guy!	Charming lad.
What's your favorite song, Lisa?	Oh, violin guy!
Play on.	The Broken Neck Blues.
Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.	Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan.
You promised you wouldn't get mad!	Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.
Good, good... You call Moe.	Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago.
Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?	Hey Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday?
Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.	Oh dad, you must've bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is.
Boy, I know you're gonna like your present.	"Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's ""Versatility."""
All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.	Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from.
All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.	I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't.
But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?	I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together.	But gambling is illegal.
Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted.	Well, I just don't know.
Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.	Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted.
Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.	You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets.
Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.	What about Daddy-Daughter day?
Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat.	I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories!
Huh?	Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat.
Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me.	So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer.
Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?	Yeah, I did.
It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?	Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.
Okay.	Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.
Dallas! Whoo-hoo!	I think Dallas is a mortal lock.
However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?	However...
"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."""	However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.
Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here.	Oh, this sucks. C'mon snipers. Where are you?
Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'.	Wow!
Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!	Dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo's going to start with excellent field position.
My daughter.	Whatcha got riding on this game?
Not Duff Dry... Dallas.	Hey Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins, your daughter loves you?
Huh?	Okay, okay. They're both great teams.
All right, we're back in business.	Touchdown Cowboys!
Please, please, please...	So, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. If Dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the Lone Star state tonight. Here's the handoff.
Yes! She loves me! She loves me!	I suspected as much.
Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!	What are you so happy about Homer? You didn't win any money.
It's beautiful.	Come on, Dad!
After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?	Isn't it though?
Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese...	Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer....
Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole.	Videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, Homer's dry-cleaning -- I think that's everything.
Alley balls?	Homer, I'm running late as it is. Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?
Alley balls...	Where's my lucky red cap?
Hey sweetheart, what's the matter?! Not gettin' enough of the good stuff at home?	Face the facts, Arnie. An overworked and under-appreciated housewife has snapped and parked her car on the bridge refusing to budge. This reporter is now going to be lowered down in the Channel Six Sky Harness for an exclusive interview.
Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?	But don't put your lips on it or anything.
What should I say?	Homer? Is that you?
Yes it's me!	"How about, ""Yes, it's me""."
I love you very much.	Tell her you love her.
And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle.	I love you very much.
Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?	Why don't you just wrap it up?
Well, all's well that ends well. Goodnight, Marge.	They're like trained seals. Toss 'em a fish and watch 'em slap their fins together.
Whaa...	Homer
What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns?	I need a vacation.
"I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. ""Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?"""	I need to unwind.
What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!	No. I mean a vacation by myself.
Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back.	No Homie, no. I still love you. A lot of couples take separate vacations.
All right then.	I swear.
She's startin' to give.	Wish I'd thought of that.
For your information, I can take care of my --	Uh-huh. He'll probably trade her for a beer and a nudie magazine.
See? Got her on the first bounce.	For your information, I can take care of my --
Good bye? Where's my clean underwear?	Goodbye, Homie.
How often should I change Maggie?	Check the dryer!
Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker?	Whenever she needs it.
Hello Maggie.	This is Coma -- WKOMA. Restful, easy listening. Coming up next, a super set of songs about clouds.
Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away...	Hello Maggie.
So, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. Just you and me.	Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away...
C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num.	Then just push nine on your phone. Then the pound sign. Then four-eight-three. We'll do the rest.
Mmm. Strained peas.	C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num.
Let go!	Mmm. Strained peas.
Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company.	Hi Homie. I feel much better.
All right, but just be careful.	No problem. Well, well, if it isn't little Bart. Remember your Uncle Barney? Hey Homer, let me hold him.
GO TO SLEEP AND GOODNIGHT/ DA DA DA / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ DEE DEE DEE / DEE DEE / May your Christmas day be nice. Goodnight, my little pork chop.	Mm-hmm. Richard Dean Anderson will be in my dreams tonight.
Heh, heh, heh.	Oh Maggie, time for your nine a.m. feeding.
Maggie?	Maggie?
Maggie?	Maggie?
Maggie?	Maggie?
Maggieeee!!!!	Maggie?
Barney, I've lost the baby. It's the worst thing I've ever done.	Oh man, you want a bad night, try sleeping on one of these.
Just help me look!	Don't worry, don't worry. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make you an omlette.
C'mon!	Are you sure? I make 'em with two kinds of cheese.
Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.	Come on!
Hello... I'd like the department of missing babies.	Yes, you can.
I came to see the kids.	What do you want?
Hmmm.	Wait here. And don't steal any light bulbs.
Hey kids... uh... you haven't seen Maggie around anyplace have you?	Dad!
Well, I gotta go.	Uh-um.
Y'ello.	Don't touch me.
Listen, Marge, uh, how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away?	Y'ello.
Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away.	Homer, that's awful!
Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh.	Please, don't jump. I know you're going through some tough times, but you have your whole life ahead of you!
Yes.	You the man who reported the lost baby?
Uh... she's small... she's a girl...	Can you describe her?
Oh Maggie!	Bingo!
You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!	Not so fast! You're wanted on three counts of criminal neglect.
You're not going anywhere.	Ah, shucks. Just don't do it again, you big lug.
Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.	Hi, did you miss me?
You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there?	And from now on I hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
Marge. Come here.	Thank you. Thank you.
Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.	Marge. Come here.
Marge, dogs love the outdoors.	Maybe we should let the dog in?
Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?	I think he needs a dog house.
Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers.	I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house.	I am not!
Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.	Oh, I don't know...
This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see.	Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
Stupid lumber...	You've got a date with a xerox machine.
Dammit! Son of a --	Stupid lumber...
The hell with this!	Dammit! Son of a --
"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""	Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited.
Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt!	He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure.
What is it, Flanders?	Homer?
Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?	I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
What the hell are you talking about?	No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth.
Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache.	Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys.
Makes you look like you've got something to hide.	What's wrong with my moustache?
People are talking... lots of people.	What?
Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.	Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?
Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing.	Strap on your skates Gordie, you're going in.
Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?	Well, you know, maybe he's right.
Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now.	Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word --
Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar.	No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think?
Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?	Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar.
What if I catch on fire?	Yes, Homer.
What if I see something really weird in the sky?	No, Homer.
What about when we snuggle?	Yes, Homer.
God --	Homer, that was a twenty.
Ohh, you son-of-a.	God --
You dirty bas...	Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal.
What do ya think, Lisa?	You dirty bas...
Well, he just goes... Ohhh	How's the dog supposed to get in?
Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down.	Oh fudge, that's broken.
Where'd you get the money?	Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse.
Maggie. Oh. Cute.	There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.
Beer! How did you know?	No, behind her.
Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night.	Mrs. Krabappel.
Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.	Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing.
Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear.	No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her.
Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.	Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."""	Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
I may hold you to that, Marge.	That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face.
Three simple words. I am gay.	"""I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live."""
P.S. -- I am gay.	Oh, that's very good, Lisa.
"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""	How shall we end it?
Why you little...	Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper.
Mmm, do - nuts.	It's a date.
Don't tell me how to eat donuts --	Hey Homer, slow down. You're gonna choke or somethin'.
Softball?	Softball starts this week.
Who's next?	Softball?
What's the matter with you guys?	Who's next?
Look, I know it wasn't our best season.	Homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight.
Well, this year's gonna be different.	Actually, it was.
Come here boy, I want to show you something.	A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be.
It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house...	What's that? A home-made bat?
Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find.	It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house...
Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of.	Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find.
I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.	Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of.
And here it is.	Homer, go back to the garage.
Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.	Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that?
Check it out, boys. My magic bat.	Okay, Homer, bases loaded and you're up. Where's that secret weapon?
Yeah, just watch.	And I got an enchanted jock strap.
Woo hoooooo!	Yeah, just watch.
Ha ha. Cops can't win!	Woo hoooooo!
Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion.	No, I want to get him a beer.
I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!	No, sir! Whom should I kill?
You're Darryl Strawberry.	One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues!
You play right field.	Yes.
I play right field too.	Yes.
Well, are you better than me?	So?
It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.	Well, I've never met you, but... yes.
Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.	You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you?
Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you.	You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.
I got it! I got it!	That's impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. By definition that is the most any one can give.
Hey, I called for that!	Yes!
No.	Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.?
"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."""	You heard me, hippie.
Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?	Aw, nuts!
One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore.	Oh, man.
Like what?	Oh, Homie. You're good at lots of things.
Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me.	Like snuggling...
No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt.	To the game.
They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me.	All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up...
I am? Whoo-hoo!	You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.
Yes.	If I tug the bill of my cap like so...
Uh uh.	...it means the signal is a fake.
Got it.	However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly.
Yes, sir!	Got that Simpson?
Huh?	Now batting for Darryl Strawberry, Homer Simpson.
Lurleen.	We won! We won! All right!
Good one, Lenny.	Wait till next year. If I'm still alive.
So what're you gonna be, boy?	Lisa, it's not that bad.
No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb.	That's nice, Bart. You know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. But they said he was too heavy.
Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?	Honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help.
Stupid fingers.	"Yeah, well I'll be frank with you, Lisa. And when I say frank, I mean, you know, devastating. You've inherited a finger condition known as ""stubbiness"". It usually comes from the father's side."
Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it.	My God, they are stubby.
Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out.	No no, sir, we're here to pick up your son. He's coming on a ride-along.
We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?	Bart's grades are up a little this term. But Lisa's are way down.
Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.	We have three kids, Homer.
Oh yeah.	No, Maggie!
One hundred and thirty million dollars!	You know, I heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars.
Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?	Yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again.
You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!	I promise nothing.
I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money...	But we never ever...
You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you.	I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me.
Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!	Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away.
Hey, down in front.	Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!
Whoo-hoo!	You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.	Magnets. Always with the magnets.
Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?	Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one.
What do kids know about spending money?	Give it to the poor.
Hmm...	What are you gonna do, Homer?
Look closer, Lenny!	Hey Homer, what'd you do? Get a haircut or something?
Fourteen carat gold!	Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold.
Take a hike boss, I'm running things now.	Fourteen carat gold!
I've got so many tickets I can't lose!	I will now draw the first winning number.
Receipts, ugh.	And the second number is... three.
"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""	Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win.
Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.	Grampa, he's not dead!
Hey, you did the best you could.	This is the part of the job I hate.
Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.	This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.
Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven.	I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and...	Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven.
Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.	Is there a Doggie Hell?
Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.	Who's in there?
Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.	Checkers.
But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...	We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop.	But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.	Thanks, Mom.
Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.	All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...	Please, do go on...
I thought maybe you...	Oh, please, continue...
Oh. Well, thanks for your time.	I thought maybe you...
What?	No.
But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.	You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
Maybe you're right, Marge.	But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?	I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
Chub? I don't even know what that is!	... will now be chub night.
Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats...	We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer...
Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?	It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
Mmm... snouts.	You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy.	Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist.
A dinosaur.	What's that?
BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...	C'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don't you? Keep singin'!
AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!	"Before his dog got sick, that ""old rummy"" used to be my best customer."
My quarter!!!	Go get it, pal.
I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you.	Mr. Laswell! I've done it again.
Yes.	Homie, did you close the gate?
Oh, you mean tonight.	Yes.
Bart! Close the gate.	The dog will get out!
Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.	It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.
Uh...the last one.	Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.
That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.	Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
Oh, Marge! There is no such place!	Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven.
Or... to put it another way... there is.	Oh, Marge! There is no such place!
And I'll be right here watching TV.	I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.
Two tickets for...	Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog.
Let me pet him again!	I love ya, boy.
I know. I want to pet him again!	You already petted him for ten minutes.
The cat? What's the point?	You can pet the cat.
Oooh, there's a good one.	Oh, there's a spot, dear.
Marge, that's just a suggested car size.	"That spot says ""compact only""."
Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?	Marge, that's just a suggested car size.
Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window.	Uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad.
Ooh, they all look great.	Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window.
"""Look Who's Oinking""! ""Look Who's Oinking""!"	"""Honey, I Hit A School Bus""!"
That's right.	Well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and I will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. Hmm?
Why Marge, you frisky little devil.	Maybe we could see something a little more adult.
"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair."""	Why Marge, you frisky little devil.
"""Political""!"	"Ooh! The paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky...	Get me Jed Kolick!
"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""	Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky...
Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!	"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
What?	Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!
I think that guy's a spy.	It's over.
Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter.	Well of course he's a spy. You just saw him go through spy school!
Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it.	Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter.
Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again.	Homie, aren't you coming inside?
Mmm...	I guess that executive stress ball we got him for Christmas isn't working.
Ew, a skunk!	Mmm...
Oh no.	Ew, a skunk!
Ooh, a redneck bar.	Oh no.
Duff please.	Them's fightin' words!
Okay, Fudd me.	We don't sell Duff. We sell Fudd.
Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.	They're all yours.
Yeah...	YOU WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ SWEAT AND BREAK YOUR BACK/
... that's true.	THEN YOU GO HOME TO YOUR CASTLE/ BUT YOUR QUEEN WON'T CUT YOU SLACK/
Uh-huh.	THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LOSIN' ALL YOUR HAIR/... THAT'S WHY YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT/...
That's right, except for the pick-up truck.	THAT'S WHY YOU FLIPPED YOUR PICK-UP TRUCK RIGHT OFF THE INTERSTATE/...
Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they...	That's right, except for the pick-up truck.
Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya.	THERE'S A LOT OF BULL THEY HAND YOU/ THERE'S NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO/ YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ NO, YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU/ BUT I DO/
Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?	I'm listenin'.
Homer J. Simpson.	So what's your name, stranger?
That's a pretty name.	My name's Lurleen Lumpkin.
Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.	Oh, you think so?
Bye Lurleen.	Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
Y'ello.	So long, Homer J. Simpson.
I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.	Where were you all night?
Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'.	You should have called. I was very worried.
YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO...	Put it back! Put it back!
Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?	Oh yeah. THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH/ ALL OVER THE WORLD TONIGHT...
Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town.	Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""	Well, if it isn't Homer J. Simpson.
Do you think I could get a copy of it?	Oh, aren't you sweet.
Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!	"Sorry, darlin', all my songs are up here. ""I'm Bastin' a Turkey With My Tears"", ""Don't Look Up My Dress Unless You Mean It"", ""I'm Sick of Your Lyin' Lips and False Teeth""..."
Come with me!	Well, I don't know.
I guess so.	Homer, it's your quarter, what do you say?
Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?	Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.	Well, it's nice. But who is this woman?
Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits.	I don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain.	Oh Homer, everybody's been callin'! Mamma, Daddy, the triplets, Vonda Mae, Piney Jo... and I owe it all to you.
Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it.	Oh Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return.
Thanks. You did say sugar, right?	Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.
Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures...	Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager.
I make a lot of stupid decisions...	That's okay.
I did bad in school.	Nobody's perfect.
My personal hygiene has been described as...	I didn't even go.
Marge, look at me.	Now this is made from a space-age fabric developed especially for Elvis. Sweat actually cleans this suit!
Uh, then maybe you better not look at me.	I'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing.
A friend bought it for me.	Homer! Where did you get that suit?
No... I think it was Lenny.	Was it Lurleen?
No!	Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
No!	Have you kissed her?
A coupla times.	Has she kissed you?
I can't. I'm her manager.	I want you to stop seeing her.
Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer.	Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there.	Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?
I'm sure Lurleen will love it.	"This studio has a lot of history. Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, ""There is no way in hell that I'm gonna record in this dump""."
Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this.	Homer, how much did you just give that man?
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.	Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight!
I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!	I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?
Stop it.	Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?
You, off the bench.	Lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. We're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track.
Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV.	You, off the bench.
Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new.	Oh Homer! You're as smart as you are handsome.
Let's hear it.	Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up.
Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye.	IN THIS TRAILER, I GET SO COLD AND LONELY/ LYIN' THERE AWAKE AT NIGHT/ MUTTERING IF ONLY YOU WEREN'T MARRIED/ SO I MIGHT ASK YOU TO BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ OH BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?
Uh-huh...	Uh, Homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. Really listen. BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT...
Right...	BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT...
Uh... I gotta think about this.	That's right Homer J.
Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready.	I gotta go. Homer...
That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?	Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth.
Sure they will.	You're not even listening to me!
Uh... I gotta go.	You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight.
Yes I am.	Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson?
Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.	I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract.
Lurleen, they loved you.	Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.
Is there anything you need?	Well thank you -- I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.	What's wrong?
At least could I have my dollar ba...	No!
I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.	I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?	I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
Okay.	Uh-huh.
Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer.	Okay.
You son of a... Sold!	I'll give you fifty bucks.
Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?	Homer?
Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.	These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Pfft.	Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight.
Ooooh.	Ewww.
Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton.	That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.
Lousy snitch.	Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton.
I am not.	Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha.
Hear hear!.	Indeed, I did. And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma.
Oooh, appetizers.	White. And what would you like for appetizers?
Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!	Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?
Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?	Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love.	Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?
Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it.	Welcome to our video honeymoon. We're using the video camera Cousin Dot gave us and the video cassette Homer gave us.
Hey, down in front.	Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
Come again?	Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!
To the Simpson mobile!	After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way.
Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer.	Hey Homer, let's book! I want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act.
Billy Beer!	Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer.
Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.	My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
I hear ya. Come on boy.	Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything.
Now, just meet me back here after the show.	It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe Comics.
Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car.	Thanks, Dad. Sure you're not gonna be bored?
Oh, Baby!	Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car.
THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...	Knock it off.
I'll be right back.	We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?
Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar.	Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR.
This is real.	I meant a real guitar.
Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!	And it came with a free instruction book.
Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him.	Homer!
Marge, what were you thinking?	Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can!
Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.	That's not my voice!
Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.	The admiral and I don't get along. Please let me stay here. I've got nowhere else to go.
"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"	"I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, ""Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.	Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can.
Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.	I tried -- Oh, Lord, how I did try.
That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?	Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV.	Uh-huh.
It doesn't matter.	What's on?
Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.	It doesn't matter.
That's it. He's outta here.	Hey, hey, I was just kidding.
"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz."	But Homer, we're the only family he's got...
Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!	Heyyy, Mr. S...
Why you little...	Yes, hail to the bus driver... Bus Driver Man!
What the...	Why you little...
So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.	Maybe I should go.
This sucks. Where is that channel changer?	Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon.
Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance.	This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
Chocolate...	We start with pure milk chocolate...
Ooh, sweet.	Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"	Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?
Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter.	According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?	They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less.
Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?	Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.
Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety.	Homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?
Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.	I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!	There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.	Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!
Ooh...a sextet of ale.	Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.
Nah.	"Well Milhouse, ""'Tis better to have loved and lost""... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade."
The vernal equinox?	Dad! Dad! Do you know what today is?
Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!	You've gained thirteen pounds.
Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food.	Yeah.
Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.	You mean a spoon?
Yeah that's good.	Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.
Forgot there was a physical today, huh?	You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now let's go whip donuts at old people
Go to hell.	Hey, no eating in the tank!
Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough...	How was your day at work, dear?
Herb?	Homer!
What the hell are you two...	And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics.
Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?	What the hell are you two...
Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?	There, there. You're safe now, little sister.
Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories.	Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?
Boring.	"""Well, I never thought I'd see it. They're dancing on the Berlin Wall. These lithe and lively lovers of liberation..."""
Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house.	Pyle!
Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse.	Yeah, you gonna to be okay?
That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.	Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse.
Would I!	Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?
Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it.	All you have to do is sign this form.
Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?	All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!

Please please please please please...	"Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as ""the quality or condition of being excellent"". And now, the winner of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence."
Don't jinx it!	Dad, you know you won.
Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!	The winner... Homer Simpson!
I miss my couch.	You cleaned me out Smokin' Joe. What's the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight?
Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.	I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.
I think I'm gonna take a walk.	Let's do it.
I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless.	Uh-uh. Nope. Nope. That's the one.
Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.	I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless.
Give me full power.	Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.
Dammit, I said full power!	But sir...
I'll take it.	Dad? Dad?
Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer.	This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that.
All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.	This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.	"""MARCHING AS TO WAR, ETC..."""
You weren't so glad to see me.	Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.
Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?	I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face.
Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode.	Can't complain.
On... off... on... off.	Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode.
Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does.	Homer, he knows how to work a light switch.
They do good work.	I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman.	That's all I got.
Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?	"Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from ""New Republic for Kids."" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""Paradise Regained,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" or Herman Melville's twin classics ""Omoo"" and ""Typee""."
Nah.	How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
Twenty minutes?!	Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
It's drinking the water!	Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this.
This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!	Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed...
It's going back for more!	No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example.
All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.	Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother.
Okay, then just give me the drinking bird.	Nope.
Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.	What do you think, Homer?
I try, but I can't.	Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!
Never mind.	You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something.	Well, Homer, now what do you think?
I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.	I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.
Well, when is he gonna act like it?	Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother.
Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me.	Oh, you stupid dryer!
What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it.	Homer, walk me to my car.
That's it?	This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same.
I see your point, brother.	That's it.
All right... but I never really hugged a man before.	Gimme a hug, brother.
Wake up, boy.	La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la. La-la-...
Well it is.	Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school.
Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door.	Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?
Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.	Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C.
Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers.	But Dad...
Woo-hoo!	8...
Stupid roller-skate.	Well, here goes nothin'.
A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?	Well, dad, here's my report card. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.	No, sir.
Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?	So I won't get to go to camp?
Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.	You mean I can go?
Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?	Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!
Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?	Ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty.
I don't see your name on it, boy.	Hey, hands off my pickle.
Oh yeah?	No, but...
Check... mate.	Oh yeah?
"""Leaves of 4, eat some more."""	"Good-bye my special little guy. Lisa, watch out for poison ivy. Remember, ""Leaves of 3, let it be."
Oh no you're not.	You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I'm finished.
He-he-he.	Ohhh...
Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds!	To evil.
And look. New hair!	Oh, that's wonderful.
I'm this close to having a comb-over!	And look. New hair!
Size... right... agility!	Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well. We are doing great. Your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever.
Ah, kids' letters from camp.	And now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. So I close by saying, save us! Save us now! Bart and Lisa.
Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here.	Oh... Homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks.
Sounds interesting.	I haven't been in a play since high school, and I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.
Sounds interesting.	You know, I spend all day alone with Maggie... and sometimes it's like I don't even exist.
A beaut from Butte.	It's time to name our five finalists, starting with... Miss Montana!
Nothin' could be finah.	Miss South Carolina!
She, uh... Good for her.	Miss Delaware!
Marge keep it down in there.	La-la-la-la-la-la-la.
Maggie! Cut that racket!	Tonight, my reign as Miss American Girl comes to an end. And I'd like to apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the United Nations.
And where exactly are you going?	Maggie! Cut that racket!
Well, this is the first I've heard about it.	I'm auditioning for a play.
Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!	"I told you several times. It's a musical version of ""A Streetcar Named..."""
Kids, back me up.	Well... I thought I told you..
Match point, Homer.	Sorry.
That's okay. We're none of us perfect.	I'm sorry, Honey.
Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?	I don't think so.
Make Bart do it.	Homer, can you run some lines with me?
You see, Marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too.	Gutterball.
Marge, your ride's here.	I'm sorry, Llewellyn. I just... I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face. Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?
Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?	Marge! Marge! I'm asking for white hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit!
Hey, there's quarters in here!	Oh here!
Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car.	Marge, every second you spend with this man, he is crushing your fragile spirit. You can't let that happen.
Marge, move it or lose it!	All I want is one embrace.
Salt me.	I'm trying... I'm trying...
Wha th... Why are you talking like that?	Heah you ah, Homah.
I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.	Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.
But Marge, what about dessert?	See you later, kids. Ah've got to go rehearse with Ned.
Fine. I will!	For God's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!
Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge!	Fine. I will!
Maaaarge! Hey, Maaaaaarrrrge!	Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge!
So what time does this play start?	Let's not and say we did.
Well I gotta, don't I?	Why? Are you going?
Probably not much of it.	I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is.
Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.	Why can't you be a little more supportive?
You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing.	What kooky projects?
You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night.	Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
Maggie, time to go to the...	If I break, buy a new one
Babies.	Maggie, time to go to the...
Huh?	It's mom!
Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing.	Almost everybody.
Shut up boy.	Lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv'nor?
Marge, you were terrific.	Shut up boy.
I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady -- Uh... uh... you know which one I mean. You played her.	Oh, come on, Homer. By the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up.
Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her.	Blanche.
I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.	Let's get 'em!
Hey, you know. I'm a lot like that guy.	No, Homer, you got it just right.
Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff...	Really?
Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la...	Well, maybe just a little.
Leggo! Leggo!	Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la...
I'm all naked and wet!	Leggo! Leggo!
Don' wanna go.	Get up, Homer. It's time for church.
Too cold out!	It's church. You have to go.
Oh, stupid itchy church pants...	I'm tired of having this argument every Sunday. Get dressed.
One size fits all, my butt!	Oh, stupid itchy church pants...
Forget it. I'm not going.	Come on. We're going to be late.
Ahhh. I'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up.	"""Resting"" hung over, ""resting"" got fired..? Help me out here."
I'm whizzing with the door open -- and I love it!	Ahhh. I'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up.
Whyyy, oh whyyy... Delilahhh?	I'm whizzing with the door open -- and I love it!
You bet your sweet... ass!	It's eleven KBBL degrees below zero. I hope you're someplace warm.
I wear short shorts!	Who wears short shorts?
The perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world Moon Waffles.	I wear short shorts!
Let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke...	The perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world Moon Waffles.
Oooh, waffle run off.	Let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke...
Mmm, fattening.	Oooh, waffle run off.
Uh-oh. Here, boy.	Ahhh... I'm there.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.	Uh-oh. Here, boy.
I know that!	Of course, Johnny's next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. If you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now!
Hello, this is Homer Simpson.	I know that!
"""This Things I Believe""."	Homer, can you name that title?
Woo-hoo!	Uh... can we accept that?
Heh-heh-heh... Moe is their leader.	You heard the lady - grab her spine and get cracking.
Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!	Excuse me... pardon me... whoop... comin' through... how ya doin'?... love that hat, baby...
Oh, well... can't win 'em all.	Let's define our terms, gentleman. Are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? Because the two are by no means the same.
Yesss!	We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.
Woo-hoo!	Oh, doctor. A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. Three visits from Morganna The Kissing Bandit... and the astonishing return of Jim Brown...
Is that what I think it is?	Woo-hoo!
I... found... a penny!	Mmm, hmm.
Could this be the best day of my life?	I... found... a penny!
Looks like we have a new champion.	Could this be the best day of my life?
Ah, my beloved family. How was church?	Looks like we have a new champion.
Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again.	That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that.
No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes.	Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?
Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?	I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer.
And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?	Amen, brother.
And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.	Tell it, daddy!
Marge, come to bed.	Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways.
Maarge... come to bed Marge...	No, Homer. He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays...
It's good for what ails ya...	Maarge... come to bed Marge...
I can wait all --	It's good for what ails ya...
God?	I can wait all --
Well... kind of... but...	THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH!
And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.	BUT WHAT?
I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?	And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
No. They moved to Phoenix.	You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a team?
You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.	Oh yeah.
Give him one for me.	I couldn't agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I'll give him a canker sore.
So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way.	I will.
Sure, honey.	Dad, can I ask you a question?
Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.	Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you.	Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.
Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?	Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you.
Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path.	No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.
Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge.	Oh, really?
Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.	So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What'd he look like?
Yeah... think about it.	"""And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there""?"
Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy.	Yeah... think about it.
Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling....	Pretty slick.
No sale.	Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock.
Leave me alone!	GET THOSE ANIMALS OUT ON THE ARKY, ARKY -
Where are we going?	I see him, son.
"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"	I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked.
There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...	Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.
Very sure.	"Coming up next, ""Make Your Own Ladder."""
"Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talkin'. ""Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as 'Love Springs Internal'."" I don't get it."	No, don't look for the pitchfork and pointy tail. Today's devil has assumed a more seductive form, pleasing to the eye.
Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?	Hello. I'm collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns. Last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of seventy-five Jewish clowns. The worst incident was during our convention in Lubbock, Texas. There were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere... it was terrible...
Sorry.	A religious clown thing, yes.
Apu, I see you're not in church.	"""Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy!"""
Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?	Oh, but I am. I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.
No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz.	Please do not offer my god a peanut.
Boy, everyone is stupid except me.	Pride goeth before destruction!
Marge, turn down the heat. That's better.	Boy, everyone is stupid except me.
Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song! The song! WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN / THERE'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN / SOMETHING... SOMETHING, THEN YOU'LL SEE/YOU'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE!	Marge, turn down the heat. That's better.
Flanders, you saved me. Why?	O-kay.
That's right, old friend.	Help! Help!
My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone.	Oh, Homey! Are you all right?
Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house!	Truly this was an act of God.
Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars...	Any valuables in the house?
Well, that's just great.	Sorry, this policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff.
You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here.	Coming up next... Which works better - springy clothes pins, or the other kind?
No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!	Yes, the lesson is...
I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am.	Ah, that's super.
I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!	Now, would you give church another try?
God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?	That's game, Hendrix!
C'mon.	Homer, I can't tell you that.
I can't wait that long.	You'll find out when you die.
No, tell me now!	You can't wait six months?
Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!	I'd say... 53 years old and 420 pounds.
A ride on the Duff Blimp...	A ride on the famous Duff Beer Blimp!
Wow.	You see the circular pattern on those fields? That's from central-pivot irrigation.
Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer..	Oops! Sorry.
Well, I want that one.	We have one at home. You never use it.
Oh my God!	And the winner of the blimp ride is... Homer Simpson!
HEY THERE BLIMPY BOY /FLYING THROUGH THE SKY SO FANCY FREE.	Oh my God!
Honey, what's wrong?	HEY THERE BLIMPY BOY /FLYING THROUGH THE SKY SO FANCY FREE.
What are you talking about?	Dad, do you think I'm ugly?
Heh heh heh... Oh, Lisa, this isn't real. It's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character.	What are you talking about?
Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear.	I'm an ugmo.
Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?	Fathers have to say that stuff.
There, see?	No! You're homely as a mule's butt!
Moe, have you ever felt unattractive?	I'd like to be alone, please.
How about you, Barney?	Mmmm... no.
I need help.	Not for a second .
Lisa's age seven to nine!	That is so sweet.
That could be Lisa!	What a feeling! I'm as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning.
Where'd you get all the money?	Sure!
Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?	No! No! I meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant?	To shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.
I sent in an application for you. I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates.	What are you talking about?
But I think she'll win.	Homer, Lisa's already sensitive about her looks. This is the last thing she needs.
Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl.	Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba.
Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would. But to me, she's beautiful.	You're looking at her through a father's eyes.
Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free --	But that ride meant everything to him!
Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.	Don't worry. I'm well protected.
No, she won't. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return.	My name is Amber Dempsey, and when I grow up, I want to be a sweetie pie!
I'll tell you when you're older.	Like what?
Hey... hey!	I know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
Nope, that's it.	Whooo! Whooo! Dad, do you know anything else about women?
Yeah! Clean up this stink hole!	My name is Lisa Simpson, and I want to be Little Miss Springfield so I can make our town a better place!
They'll love you just as much as I do.	Ooh, that just kept goin' huh? And now here's... ... Lisa Simpson!
Hmmm.	Thanks, Dad.
Bless you boys.	"But you're a role model to young people. And we're thinking of retiring ""Menthol Moose""."
I know.	Homer, those are ice cream men.
If it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. You must hate me.	"Well, that's obviously the wrong footage. Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson, filled out the pageant application incorrectly. In the area under ""Do not write in the space"" he wrote ""okay."""
I don't know. Was I drunk?	Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?
Really?	Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. And I do.
Will you remember this the next	Uh-huh.
time I wreck your life?	Will you remember this the next
Oh yeah? With what?	Hey Homer - where's your present?
I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave...	Oh yeah? With what?
I will get you one now!	Hey!
Do you sell toys?	I will get you one now!
Well, I need something for my son's birthday.	We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt... which I call frogurt!
Ooh, that's bad.	Take this object. But beware, it carries a terrible curse.
That's good.	But it comes with a free frogurt.
That's bad.	The frogurt is also cursed.
That's good.	But you get your choice of topping.
Can I go now?	That's bad.
Happy birthday, son!	Can I go now?
Woo hoo!	...And in environmental news, scientist have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly.
Didn't even pull the string that time.	I'm Krusty the Clown and I'm going to kill you!
That doll tried to kill me!	Homer, what's wrong?
Don't leave me alone with him.	I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?
MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R.	Don't leave me alone with him.
Goodbye, Dolly.	You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well... they are making me dizzy...
And that is that.	What the?...
Marge, Marge, look!	Guess who, Fat Boy?
The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!	Oh my God.
Ew. Dog water.	The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
Come here you.	I love you, Homer.
Did you walk the dog?	Here ya' go buddy.
Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk.	Yeah, he buried me a couple a times.
... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!	Here, let me get that for ya.
Did I mention she was dead?	So?
Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!	No.
Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.	And?
Ooo.	Smithers, this is a golden opportunity. If we get him alive we can put him on Broadway. Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the Army!
Did you wreck the car?	Dad, we did something very bad.
Did you raise the dead?	No.
But the car is okay?	Yes.
All right then.	Uh huh.
Why? Oh, the zombies. No.	Homer, did you barricade the door?
To the book depository!	It's our only hope.
He was a zombie?	Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders!
I'm a-comin' boy!	The zombies have the earthlings on the run.
Barney! Not you, too!	Ow... careful... not the face.
Take that Washington!	I'm not a zombie. But hey, when in Rome... Wow, George Washington.
Eat lead, Einstein!	Take that Washington!
Show's over, Shakespeare!	Eat lead, Einstein!
Man... fall down. Funny.	Shh! TV!
Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.	What are we going to have?
Oh no. I'm not making two stops.	Poison pizza.
All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's.	Oh no. I'm not making two stops.
All right. Tell you what. I'm thinking of a number between one and 50.	That's the way we do it every year.
I mean, no.	Is it 37?
Please Marge... please, please, please, please, please?	Homer!
Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!	Oh, all right.
Hee hee!	Ach.
I did. I did read to her!	Mr. Simpson... I just wanted to tell you that you've done a wonderful job with Lisa. You must have read to her at a young age.
Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool.	I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick!
"Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three ""R's"": ""reading TV Guide""... ummmm, writing to TV Guide... and renewing TV Guide."	Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool.
"""My child is on the Honor Roll at Springfield Elementary."" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my ""Where's the Beef"" bumper sticker. Heh, heh, heh... ""Where's the Beef""."	Ew!
Huh? Oh.	Uh... we'd like the desk back Mr. Simpson.
Bus-ted!	Just do it.
Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!	Homer, we have a problem here.
Oh. That guy.	We're talking about Bart.
He's the boy you love to hate.	Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.	Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes.
"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""	You already put me in a home.
"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."	Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present.	Now this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours.	Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?
Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.	Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I'd better straighten up and fly...
Just promise me you'll try to be good.	Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.
Thataboy.	I promise.
Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?	Wow.
Hey you goats, get outta here!	Indeed I did.
Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this.	Hey you goats, get outta here!
Run along, ya little scamp.	Ayy, el estomago!
Bart! Why are you doing that?	Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells...
Well, this time you must be punished.	I'unno.
No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute...	Well, you could punish me, but...
Ice cream truck!	No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute...
Me, me. I was here first!	Ice cream truck!
Now, what were we talking about, boy?	Me, me. I was here first!
Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.	Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
I'unno.	Why are you letting him do this?
All right. All right. Bart, go to your room.	Well punish him!
How could you let this happen?	How could you let this happen?
Oh. How convenient.	I wasn't here!
Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?	Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper?
Now who's being naive.	Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick.	Look, you have to help discipline your son.
Sorry, but the punishment stands.	"It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled ""That Happy Cat""."
Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?	We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!	All rrright. Time for a crime spree.
Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!	Come on, Homer. This isn't funny.
Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.	Come on, go nuts.
Hmm...	Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?
YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU...	"That's one small step for man	 one giant leap for mankind."
... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING...	YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU...
Someday you'll thank me for this, son.	I regret nothing!
No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage.	Not bloody likely.
I like stories.	Dad, what's the point of this story?
I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV.	Look, can I please go to the movie?
I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that.	TV sucks.
But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.	Homer, we'd like to talk to you.
Don't you think I know that?	Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine.
"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."	Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him.
No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special.	Well, Dad, I guess you won.
All right. I think you've learned your lesson.	Come on. What d'ya say?
I'll get it son.	One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Mmm... Soylent Green.	One Soylent Green. Hold the butter.
Which one's the mouse?	Mmm... Soylent Green.
Itchy's a jerk.	Itchy.
Oooh, give it here.	"Resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""Lemon Time""..."
Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?	Homer, that's dish washing liquid!
I wish I could retire.	Oooh! They're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
Boy, that'd be sweet.	I wish I could retire.
Can't talk -- busy.	Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I'd fire up the briar.
All part of God's great plan.	Did you notice how slanted he looked?
The half-assed approach to foundation repair.	Haw haw!
Ready!	"Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such instructional videos as ""Mothballing Your Battleship"" and ""Dig Your Own Grave - and Save!"" Now over the next six hours I'll be taking you through the do's and do not do's of foundation repair. Ready?"
Hand me my patching trowel, boy.	First, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel...
Hmm.	Hand me my patching trowel, boy.
No.	Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation?
Wha-do I do...	Good. Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws. Install.
Wait a minute...	After applying brushable coating to the panels...
Wait a minute...	....you'll need some corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath.
Uh huh?	If you can't find metal stucco lath....
Did you see the bubble?	Now, parge the lath...
Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!	I'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. I figure it's gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred.
Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are...	Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!
Huh?	"Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet ""Cue Ball,"" the man with no hair!"
Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need.	We have to do something...
Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.	I could get a job.
March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV.	Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
Bo-ring!	Tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours...
Bo-ring.	A man who provided the Burns Corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, Mr. Jack Marley.
"Forget it Marge. We already live together	 we shouldn't work together. As the Bible says ""Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."""	Maybe I should apply for that job.
It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad.	"Where does the Bible say ""racket?""...."
Marge have you seen my lunch box?	curator of large mammals?
Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home...	Oh dear.
"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."	Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home...
Yeah, lemonade is good.	We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.
Wha dey do?	I think it's wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt .	Cool!
"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci."	I'll just be a minute. I have to finish this paperwork.
Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do.	But, where does it go?
Marge, get my gun.	That woman -- she's so captivating. Smithers, my heart's pounding like a jackhammer.
You can't take our donuts!	It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.
Oh, man, I really gotta...	Springtime fresh, winter white... what could be better?
I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.	Homie, what's wrong?
Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.	Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder.
Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight.	Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!	You know the problem here was water leakage. If you just buy a fifty cent washer --
No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife.	Well, I guess that's it. People like us can't afford justice. Come on Homie, let's go before he fires you too.
Damn right!	You love her, too.
Gotcha. Marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice.	Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life.
Ooh, me too.	Huh, huh, but, I'm going to have to go with Shasta 'cause she liked makin' bacon on the beach.
Ahhh, bacon.	Ooh, me too.
Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?	Mr. Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move...
Mmm... no.	Yes, well, there's a few things you could do to help us sell our home. First, whenever you walk in front of your window could you please wear pants?
Mmm... no.	Second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past Halloweens.
Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!	And please cover your garbage. It's attracting wildlife.
Homer, you're not listening!	Hello, what's this? Wire hangers! Expired medicine! Old newspapers! Okay Homer, stay calm. Just quietly get this stuff inside your house.
Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen.	That medicine's not for you.
Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant.	"Set sail for ""The Fryin' Dutchman."""
Mmmm, shrimp.	But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions.
There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?	Sigh.
My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.	I guess I should explain. Laura's father and I divorced two years ago. Oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career.
...All you can eat, ha!	Hurts, don't it?
Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels.	Daad!
"No ""All You Can Eat Seafood."" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!"	No, Bart, put it down. Put it down, Bart. Bart, put it down...
Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around...	I'll send Laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home.
That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing.	My divorce.
Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food.	Well I know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites.
Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?	I'm not.
I hear you loud and clear.	Right.
All you can eat. All you can eat.	Excellent choice... and for the gentleman?
Can't talk... eating.	Six bells, time for closin'.
Hey, hey, hey!	Fairly warned be thee, says I.
"But the sign said ""All you can eat."""	Hey, hey, hey!
Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I'm like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills...	Oh, please don't. For me?
No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha.	Don Quixote?
No!	Don Quixote.
Fine. I'll look it up.	I really think that was the character's name... Don Quixote!
Never mind.	Well, who was it?
All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!	It's not working!
So you think I have a case?	"Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film ""The Neverending Story."""
Woo hoo!	"Homer, I don't use the word ""hero"" very often. But you are the greatest hero in American history."
Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...	Dad, I have some questions about women.
..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town.	Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did.	Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know.
Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.	Are you sure...?
Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!	Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?
"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."	Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!
Thanks, that means a lot to me.	Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad.
Hey!	It was a moonless night, dark as pitch, when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man.
Right here.	Uh, there's a pizza here for...
Come on, Marge, let the people see your pretty face.	I've a proposition for ye, fair and true.
Moe! Don't throw out that brine!	How someone someone abuse their body that way?
But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban.	Hi, Homie. It's really starting to snow. I think you should come home.
Ohh.	You're dead weight, Marty.
It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography.	"Now, before I give you the check, one more question: Uh, this place ""Moe's"" you left just before the accident: this is a business of some kind?"
What country is this car from?	She'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.
Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free.	Put it in H!
Do you come with the car?	Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free.
The Batmobile!	This exhibit is closed.
Adam West! Hey kids, Batman!	The Batmobile!
Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact.	"Michelle Pfeiffer... ha! The only true ""Catwoman"" is Julie Newmar, Lee Merriwether or Eartha Kitt. And I didn't need molded plastic to improve my physique. Pure West. And how come Batman doesn't dance anymore? Remember the Batusi?"
Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow.	Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact.
Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality.	Homer, I've got to sneak these viable artworks out of the White House. But I can't get out of my driveway because of those protesters.
Well... I really should discuss this with my wife.	Pally, this doesn't cost money, it makes money! You make the payments by plowing driveways on the side.
What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?	Your wife?
If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things.	I can't believe you bought that plow. We can't afford it.
Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!	Good.
No.	Oh, Homie, didn't that hurt?
Marge didn't reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket.	No.
Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226.	And now, to read from the Epistles of St. Paul, Homer Simpson.
Not as low as my low, low prices.	Homer, this is really low.
Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow.	Not as low as my low, low prices.
I'm gonna lose my plow.	Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow.
Hmmm.	"Act now and get a bonus CD: ""Hornpipe Fever."" Arrgh."
Almost time for our commercial.	Hmmm.
Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners...	Dad, who's watching TV at 3:17 a.m.?
It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV!	Look! There we are!
Stop!	That's right! I fill your driveways with ice and snow! What are you gonna do about it? Nuthin', that's what.
Get out of here, you lousy... season!	Mr. Plow!
Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?	All right... I'm goin'... My head hurts. I have to lie down for a while.
Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt.	Uh-huh.
He could still surprise ya!	Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt.
Absolutely! My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage.	But I'm a real tightwad. Can I afford this remarkable system?
Shut up, boy.	You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you Mr. Plow?
So remember...	Shut up, boy.
CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW!	So remember...
Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game.	CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW!
"The waiting game sucks. Let's play ""Hungry, Hungry Hippos."""	Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game.
Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be.	I wish I was a hero.
How do you think he'll do, Moe?	Here I come world!
Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth?	This might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind...
Oooh. Heh heh heh.	No. No. Could you wear the Mr. Plow jacket. Just uh... for fun.
CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW.	Oooh. Heh heh heh.
Ah, white gold.	CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW.
What the... What happ... uh... oh no...	Ah, white gold.
Barney, you stole my idea!	Hi ya, Homer! Say hello to the Plow King!
Flanders, I thought I was your plow man.	Thank you, Plow King-a-lee-ding.
Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.	Ah, Homer, why don't you plow it again?
Mr. West! You said there was a job for me!	Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
Ring, damn you. Ring!	So long Superman. Your secret identity is safe with me.
Mister Plow... that name again is Mr. Plow.	Ring, damn you. Ring!
"Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from ""Leave It To Beaver""? Yeah, they were gay."	Hello, I'm calling from Delinquent Accounts at Kumatsu Motors --
Oh, what am I gonna do?	"Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from ""Leave It To Beaver""? Yeah, they were gay."
I know! I'll do a rap. I'M MR. PLOW AND I'M HERE TO SAY: I'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE.	I think you should do a new ad. One that's fresh and original.
All right.	Promise you'll never do that again.
I don't know.	Dad, was that your commercial?
I thought there was chocolate inside.	These look like teeth marks.
Well, why was it wrapped in foil?	I thought there was chocolate inside.
Hmm...	That's great Arnie.
Hello... Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak.	Hmm...
There's a $10,000 bill in it for you.	I don't know. I'd be up there all day... I wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways...
Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.	Oh yeah? Which president's on it?
Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers.	Well, I guess you can plow my driveway. But I wonder what happened to the Plow King.
Kiss my asphalt.	Oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?
"So I says, ""Kiss my asphalt."" Hmm? Hmm?"	Kiss my asphalt.
Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat.	Homie, please don't go.
Barney!	Ah, dying's not so bad. I'll be reunited with my loved ones. My dad... and that plant I never watered.
Barney, that's great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them.	Homer, you saved my life and I'm not gonna forget it. From now on, we'll be partners.
Y'ello.	"Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded greenhouse effect? Well, if 70-degree days in the middle of winter are the ""price"" of car pollution, you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac."
Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I --	Hello, this is the Repo Depot. I'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow.
You mean...	Ohh, now Homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something.
MR. PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.	You mean...
"Maggie, can you say ""daddy""? Dad-dy?"	He does not.
Takes one to know one!	"Well, don't push her. Remember, ""Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."""
Yeah, tell it, Mom.	Tell it, Mom. Tell, it Mom.
WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT...	I miss-a da Klinger already.
Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy.	Homer!
Daddy.	Homer.
Daddy.	Homer.
Ye-esss...	Da... da... da...
Why you little...	Domer.
He'll tire himself out soon.	Why you little...
Heh, heh. Got your nose.	Hi yo!
Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand?	Got your wallet.
We're gonna start doin' it in the morning?	Guess what, Homie... There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.
Oh.	No.
Marge that's...	We're going to have another baby.
No, we won't. I've got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21!	I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
My cousin Frank did it.	Won't that warp him?
He became Francine back in '76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now.	You don't have a cousin Frank.
Mmmm. Hog fat.	Once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat, you'll wonder how you ever did without it.
Once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad.	Don't forget to check out the galley -- that's real shag carpeting. Arrr.
Wow. How much? How much?	Just imagine what we can do with this place.
I can't afford that!	Well, here's what they're asking.
Dad, I have a problem.	I can't afford that!
Are you done?	Why'd you come to me. I don't know nothing. I used to get by on my looks. Now they're gone -- withered away like an old piece of fruit.
Dad, I don't need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home.	No, not yet. I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York.
You didn't build this house. You won	Oh! Well, all I own is this house, that I built with my own two hands.
it on a crooked '50's game show!	You didn't build this house. You won
Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. I'd be honored if you came to live with us.	All right, son. I'll sell this dump and write you a check.
About three weeks.	So, how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks home?
Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.	Mommy.
What? What?	Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.
All right, you win round seven.	What? What?
Your what-what?	When are we going to get to my first word?
Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes.	My first word.
"Wait a minute. That was a ""Lucy"" show... Okay, where were we?"	Daaad!
Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...	Mom was pregnant and Dad just threw our money down the sink hole.
"Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me ""Daddy."""	Hey, Homer. This house sucks.
Hi, Flanders.	Buenos dias, neighboritos. The handle's Flanders, but my friends call me Ned.
I could use a TV tray.	If you need anything, just give a whistle.
Whaat?	Well, gee, I...
You said, anything.	I just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
"And that ""little while"" is now eight years and counting. Heh heh heh."	Sure, you can borrow it for a little while.
Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day.	Bart, get out!
Duh.	Krusty funny.
All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib.	Crib! Crib! I'm a baby!
Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius.	All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib.
I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed. Now you can laugh yourself to sleep.	Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius.
Patience, my pet.	... The Americans are heavy favorites.
Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life?	Homie... I think the baby's coming.
Yes!	Coming up next, an hour-long episode of Mama's Family.
Shut up, Flanders.	We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson. Enjoy the miracle of creation.
Little Lisa. I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan.	"Can you say ""David Hasselhoff""?"
Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.	According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her.
Bart, there's someone in here who wants to meet you.	Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.
"""Where's the beef?"" No wonder he won Minnesota."	"""Where's the beef?"" What the hell's that supposed to mean?"
I like those odds.	You people are pigs! I personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger.
Please, please, please, please, please...	Ouch! But first, let's go to the boxing venue.
"Can you say ""Daddy""?"	Davah Hassahoff.
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!...	The American Drederick Tatum does a triumphant turkey trot over the supine Swede. One's thoughts turn to Alexander of Macedon's victory at Granicus and Issus.
Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.	I'm sorry, Bart, you're too little.
What?	Homer!
Goodnight, honey.	What?
Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.	And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr...
"No, sweetie. ""Daddy."""	"Wow! Lisa, can you say ""Mommy""?"
Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back.	Did too.
I hope you never say a word.	Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back.
I can't wait till they throw his hatless butt in jail.	"This is ""Papa Bear."" Put out an A.P.B. for a male suspect	 driving a... car of some sort	 heading in the direction of a... you know, that place that sells chili. Suspect is hatless. Repeat, hatless."
My heart is just fine...	It's not good for your heart.
Just workin' the turkey through. There it goes!	Homie, what is it?
You know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? I've got that right now. Ooh... bacon!	Daaad!
It could only be one thing.	Homer, I prepared a special surprise just for you.
What the hell is this?	Here you go.
Ooh, oatmeal. What a delightful treat. Ugh, there's a bug in it.	Nice healthy oatmeal.
Trust me.	No there isn't.
Eh.	Dad, there's a bug on that.
Come on, come on!	Eh.
I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.	Now, you've done it.
Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.	It's your heart. And I think it's on its last thump.
Huh?	Now don't worry, Homer. You're the kind of guy I could really dig. A grave for. Your indolence is inefficacious!
More.	Clear!
Thank you.	More.
Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes.	Oh, Homie, I was so frightened.
FALL ON YOUR KNEES / OH HEAR THE ANGELS' VOICES /	How'd he get that?!
OH NI-IGHT, DI- Vine. Hey, my voice just changed.	What a voice. Young Homer is going to make me a millionaire.
OH NIGHT, WHEN CHRIST WAS BORN...	OH NI-IGHT, DI- Vine. Hey, my voice just changed.
But I'm out of the woods now, right? I mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.	Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you've just had a mild heart attack.
Hey, c'mon, quit it.	Oh no, quite the opposite. It's made you weak as a kitten. Look!
Stop. Please stop.	Coochy coochy coo!
Please, have mercy.	Oh, you swing like a girl. Come on, now.
Not funny.	Got your nose.
No! Remember your hippopotamus oath.	How 'bout this little bee?
What an age we live in!	Well, we can't fix his heart, but we can tell you exactly how damaged it is.
Hi.	Good lord.
Woo hoo, look at that blubber fly.	Now Homer, this is a new body fat analysis test. I start you jiggling, and measure how long it takes to stop.
Say it in English, doc.	Homer, I'm afraid you'll have to undergo a coronary by-pass operation.
Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.	You're going to need open heart surgery!
Could you dumb it down a shade?	We're going to cut you open and tinker with your ticker.
Okay, okay. We need forty-thousand dollars. Now, how much do we have in the checkbook?	I'm afraid it's now forty thousand.
Hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven't cleared yet?	Seventy dollars.
Well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge.	No. Don't you have health insurance at work?
Questions? Questions? Oh gee, my whole scheme down the... I mean, ask away.	Now before we give you health insurance, I have to ask you a few questions.
"Oh, I thought that said, ""Brain Hemorrhages."""	"Oh good. Now, under ""Heart Attacks"" you crossed out ""3"" and wrote ""0""."
I do enjoy a snifter of port at Christmas.	Uh huh. And uh, do you drink?
Now let me tell you something, Mr. Sucker... I just...	All right. Here's your policy.
Oh. I...	Oh, hold on there, you still have to sign it.
Must... sign... policy...	Oh. I...
"I made an ""H""."	Sir, I'm sorry, we can't insure you.
"Looks like an ""X."""	No, that doesn't count.
Can I have a free calendar?	We'd better get you to a hospital.
Oh doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone. And there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt.	Okay.
I can't afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines.	Mr. Simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible.
Oh yeah, that's the stuff.	I can't afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines.
"Now, I know I haven't been the best Christian. In fact, when you're up there ""Blah, blah, blah-ing"" I'm usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners... well, anyhoo... can I have forty-thousand dollars?"	Oh yeah, that's the stuff.
"Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew... but I rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars?"	"Now, I know I haven't been the best Christian. In fact, when you're up there ""Blah, blah, blah-ing"" I'm usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners... well, anyhoo... can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
Now, I know I haven't been the best... aw, forget it.	"Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew... but I rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
No, but the rabbi gave me this.	Honey, did you have any luck?
"Son, they call it a ""droodle"". Whoo hoo! Look at him go!"	What is it, Dad?
Bo-ring.	Hi Everybody. Are you looking for a way to slash the cost of your medical expenses?
Well, Marge, we could do worse.	"Okay, friend. You tried the best, now try the rest. Call 1-600-DOCTORB. The ""B"" is for bargain!"
Uh... some dog could do the operation.	How?
Kids, I have something to tell you.	Operation? What are you talking about?
Really? What's it like?	We feel neither highs nor lows.
Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.	Eh.
So the tiny Aorta Fairies will take Mr. Leg Vein on a long trip to get married to Princess Left Ventricle.	Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
Uh, yeah.	Dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary-artery bypass graft?
Kids. Kids... I'm not gonna die. That only happens to bad people.	Oh, no. What if they botch it? I won't have a dad... for a while.
Uh... he sold poison milk to school children.	What about Abraham Lincoln?
Hey, I'm just trying to make it easier on 'em.	Homer!
Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down.	Hey, I'm just trying to make it easier on 'em.
Flanders? What are you doin' here?	"Homer Simpson! Well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
Who are you donating them to?	I'm having a kidney and a lung removed.
I got a bad heart.	First come, first served! What are you in for?
Shut up, Flanders.	If I could give you my heart, Homer, I would.
Dear Lord, I'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. If something happens, please look after Marge, and make sure my kids grow up right.	Ah, you know, Homer, that beer ain't free.
Sorry.	Shhh.
Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down...	In heaven, you get to do whatever you like best, all the time.
Bed goes up. Bed goes down...	Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down...
Krusty, why are you here?	Hey, what's the matter? Oh, that's right. My grotesque appearance.
Oh well, I could use a good laugh.	Oh, it's part of my public service for my glug, glug, vroom, vroom, thump thump.
You seem okay.	Well, there's nothing funny about what you're about to go through. I know, I'm in the Zipper Club myself.
Gee, thanks, guys.	We passed this card around at work.
Barney, I'm not getting a sex change!	When I first heard about the operation, I was against it. But then I thought, if Homer wants to be a woman, so be it.
Thanks, Moe.	Uh, Homer, I snuck you in a beer for old time's sake.
Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants.	And a new... no!
Now, Marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're gonna be lonely...	Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants.
Darn right. And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows.	Oh Homie, I could never remarry...
Bed goes up... Kids, I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. Let's see... uh... Oh, I'm no good at this.	Ohhh... kids, you can come in now.
Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won't get to see you grow up, because...	Bed goes up... Kids, I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. Let's see... uh... Oh, I'm no good at this.
I know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man.	Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won't get to see you grow up, because...
And Lisa...	Thanks dad.
I guess this is the time to tell you...	And Lisa...
You're adopted and I don't like you.	I guess this is the time to tell you...
Bart!	You're adopted and I don't like you.
But don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you.	Bart!
Yabba dabba doo!	You rule intensive care!
SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE	Yabba dabba doo!
Oh, Andy Capp, you wife-beating drunk.	Sold!
"Like a giant billboard that says, ""No fat chicks""?"	Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of.
Get to the money!	Ordah! Please rise for the a Pledge of Allegiance.
Bo-ring!	Excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town.
Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!	Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
Heh-heh... mule.	You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!
Mono...	MONORAIL / MONORAIL / MONORAIL!
Well, you should have written a song like that guy.	I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.
Maybe.	Are you stuck in a dead-end job?
What's it to ya?	Are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box?
Does whiskey count as beer?	Are you on your third beer of the evening?
Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor.	Actual institute may not match photo.
It's my life-long dream.	Homer, no...
Oh, yeah.	Your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?
Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true.	True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail?
That's right, boy.	"No, you were right, it's ""false."" Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!"
Heh-heh. Kids.	You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job.
Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!	But now, I want to follow in your footsteps.
"""What if?"" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!"	According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong?
We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on?	It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
What if I undo this button?	No.
What if I talk like this?	Goodnight, Homer.
What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken.	What if I talk like this?
Who, me?	But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.
Woo-hoo!	Yeah, sure.
And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake.	After an exhaustive search, Springfield has found its monorail conductor -- Homer Simpson.
THE WICKED WITCH.	And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake.
I call the big one Bitey.	Homer, there's a family of opossums in here!
I call the big one Bitey.	Is there a chance the track could bend?
I call the big one Bitey.	Is there a chance the track could bend.
I locked my keys in there. Get a rock.	You just better have a damn good conductor.
All aboard!	His car SCREECHES off.
Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!	Uh-huh.
I'm trying my best.	Can't you stop it, Dad?
I did it!	Does anyone wanna switch seats?
Are we gonna die, son?	No. The world needs laughter.
Y'ello.	Homer? Homer?
Batman?	Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you.
Batman's a scientist.	No, he's a scientist.
I'll take that.	Think harder, Homer.
Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?	Arr. Ye call that an anchor?
Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was.	Dad, you're a hero!
Wowww.	"And ""The Washing Machine""!"
Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gardens.	See the happiest fish in the world at our fabulous Beerquarium!
Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?	Yayyy!
And I'm a college student! Heh, heh.	We're under six!
But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!	No use complaining about something you can't change.
I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead woman.	Oh Homer, quit pouting.
Ding-dong, the witch is dead.	If you don't mind! We're on our way to a funeral.
Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.	WHICH OLD WITCH?
Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.	Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me.
Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good.	Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!
What?	Homer, that's very rude of you.
All right, I'm almost there.	Could we please stop somewhere? My butt's asleep.
Please.	Another placemat, sir?
Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers.	Patty, I want a baby.
It's just not fair, dammit!	Eh.
All in favor of skipping the poem?	Homer!
Thank you.	All in favor of skipping the poem?
Uh, oh.	These chips were my children, Marjorie. Take special care of them.
Sure... unless another aunt dies.	Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend?
Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot.	Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?
I knew that.	Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot.
Sand... wich...	Have you been eating that sandwich again?
I'll give it a good home.	Geez, we hardly made a dent in that ten-foot hoagie.
Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.	You've been eating that thing for a week. I think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
Suggestion noted.	Homer, I found this behind the radiator. I really think you should throw it away.
Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment.	Suggestion noted.
Yes.	Are you going to eat it?
I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.	You look terrible.
S-s-o cold.	I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.
No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah!	Your lips are turning blue. I think you'd better stay home.
But I love solids.	Goodbye Dad! Don't eat any solids.
This is all your fault! Oh, how can I stay mad at you?	Yayyy!
No. What are the odds of getting sick on a Saturday? A thousand to one.	Do you feel any better?
Yentl? Whuzzat?	"Well, to cheer you up I rented a couple of videos. ""Boxing's Greatest Weigh-Ins"" and ""Yentl""."
Sounds great!	It deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter Rabbinical school.
"That Yentl puts the ""she"" in Yeshiva."	What's going on here? Oh, Yentl. I might have known.
That's what you think .	Hmmm, well, you've cooled down.
The Erotic Adventures of Hercules.	You know, I rented another tape... in case you felt better.
Woo hoo!	With Norman Fell as Zeus!
Come to Homercles.	Oh, I'm not a doctor.
Homercles cares not for beans.	I can't. The beans'll burn.
Hi, kids. How was Duff Gardens?	Homercles cares not for beans.
You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this...	How do you do it, Homer?
I'm on my way!	Homer, we're going to my sisters'! Remember, pick up Bart!
What'd ya say, Marge?	I'm on my way!
Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something.	After sixteen glorious seasons, the Green Bay faithful bid farewell to Bryan Bartlett Starr.
What am I supposed to do?	I can't think with all this noise!
Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?	What am I supposed to do?
Bart?... Bart!	Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?
Whyyyyy?!... Howwwww?!... Whennnn?!... Whichhh?...	Bart?... Bart!
Bart!	Whyyyyy?!... Howwwww?!... Whennnn?!... Whichhh?...
Shut up, Flanders.	Hey Homie, I can see your doodle!
Hey, boy. How was soccer practice?	Shut up, Flanders.
"Hey, Bart, son. Here's my way of saying, ""I'm sorry."""	Hey, boy. How was soccer practice?
Bart's not mad at me.	Bart's dad has really pulled himself together.
Marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. And to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. Permit me to demonstrate.	He called you a bad father.
It's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It's not fair, it's not fair I tells ya.	Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?
Wasn't me.	"No, no. Someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called ""The Corey hotline."""
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Dad, can I...
Hit me.	Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand.
Hit me.	Twenty.
Hit me.	Twenty-one.
Hey, boy! Where you going?	Hi, this is Corey. I hope you and I can get married some day.
Have a good time! Wait a minute.	Father-son picnic.
So that's it!	Bart, I could kiss you, if the Bigger Brothers hadn't made me sign a form promising I wouldn't. No one needs me more than a child with your tragic upbringing. Now, let's set down at that Frogurt stand.
Hello, son. Where have you been?	So that's it!
No, you haven't! You've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Haven't you, haven't you. Look at me.	Playing with Milhouse.
"How would you like me to take it? ""Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, I'll be waiting for you?"" I'm sorry, I can't do it."	Dad, it just kinda happened. You're taking this too hard.
Uh... Revenge.	And what are your reasons for wanting a little brother?
What the?	Uh... Revenge.
Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!...	Any of these boys would be thrilled to have a bigger brother like you.
Ehhh, maybe this was a mistake.	Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!...
I'll take him! Do you have him in blonde?	Do you have a bigger brother for me yet? Okay. I'll be back in an hour.
Pepi!	Just like Oscar the Grouch.
Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now.	Poppa Homer!
Oh, he is.	Your son Bart sounds very bad.
Son, I just want you to know I love you very much.	Oh, he is.
Mmm... grapefruit.	Shaddap!
I just press this button and the door opens like magic.	Mmm... grapefruit.
Because it's a stupid piece of junk!	Why does it stop there?
Well, I'd better get you home.	Because it's a stupid piece of junk!
What's the matter?	Well, I'd better get you home.
Well, there's... Jerry, the cowboy. And that big dipper-looking thing is Alan... the cowboy.	Tell me more! I want to know all the constellations!
"""Learned,"" son, it's pronounced ""learned."""	Oh, Poppa Homer, you are so learned.
I love you too, Pepsi.	I love you, Poppa Homer.
Pepi.	Pepi.
I gave it to Pepi.	Hey, Homer, have you seen my skateboard?
He's my little brother. That's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.	Who the hell is Pepi?
Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing?	Who needs you? Tom's a better father than you ever were.
Liar!	I was faking it.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!	"Oh yeah? Remember this? ""Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!..."""
No.	Is that true?
Come 'n' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin.	No.
Hey!	Come 'n' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin.
He's got my hotdog!	Hey!
Oh... it's you. So, you're looking well.	He's got my hotdog!
For your information, I'm his father!	Come on, Bart. You know better than to talk to strangers.
That's right. And who might you be?	His father? The drunk and gambler?
Oh. Right.	Uh... Homer?
This is even more painful than it looks.	Oh. Right.
Thanks, son.	Another beer, Dad?
Yeah?	"Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, ""I'm a hemophiliac"" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?"
Sure, boy.	Will you teach me how to do that?
First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. That's when it's time to kick some back.	Sure, boy.
And then when he's lying on the ground...	First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. That's when it's time to kick some back.
Kick him in the ribs...	Yeah.
Step on his neck, and run like hell.	Yeah.
Happy... Valentine's Day!	And this is for my Huggy Bug in honor of this special day.
Woo hoo!	Ah, thank you, dear.
Uh, kind of. Nobody makes a big deal out of Valentine's Day.	I'll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh Dad?
What a nice idea, son. It's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. I'll just go get it.	Hey, Dad. Why don't you give Mom her present?
Perhaps this might be appropriate.	Apu, you gotta help me! I need a valentine's gift for my wife.
Yes! You saved my life. How much?	Perhaps this might be appropriate.
What? That's highway robbery! I won't pay it!	One hundred dollars.
Forget it, pal!	Ohh, I think you will.
All right. But I'll never shop here again.	La da de / La da da... La da dum da de da da dum da dum da de
Sold!	Nickel off on expired baby food.
I'd sell my first-born son.	Oh, I'd give anything to go to that show!
You'll do as your told.	Hey!
Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life have been without it?	Ralph thinks I like him. But I only gave him a valentine 'cause I felt sorry for him.
"Let me handle this, Marge. I've heard 'em all. ""I like you as a friend,"" ""I think we should see other people,"" I no speak English""..."	Well, honey, I--
"""I'm married to the sea,"" ""I don't want to kill you, but I will--"	I get the idea.
"And if that doesn't work, six simple words: ""I'm not gay, but I'll learn."""	Thanks, Mom.
Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?	Forget it. To get those tickets our parents would have to be part of Springfield's cultural elite.
Eww.	Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
She's in the can. Go away.	Oh no, it's Ralph! Just make some excuse.
Really?	Yes, sir. I'd do anything for Lisa.
Yeah, they'll do that.	Mr. Simpson, the tar fumes are making me dizzy.
Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don't you?	Dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?
Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do.	Well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me.
Oh, shaddup.	Homer, that's a terrible thing to say.
Something wrong, officer?	Aw, come on! Come on! Give that back. I need it. Ah, keep it.
Where?	Yeah. You got a tail-light out.
You know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops.	Right there.
C'mon, boy! Finish him off!	Hasta la vista, Abie.
Woo hoo!	And now, our evening comes to an end...
Yeah, syrup is better than jelly.	Homer, I want you to encourage Lisa with her science fair project.
Where's your Science Fair project, boy?	Yes please!
Whelp, time to go to work.	Bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!
Roll in at nine, punch out at five. That's the plan.	Whelp, time to go to work.
Then to the Duff Brewery.	Roll in at nine, punch out at five. That's the plan.
I gotta think of a lie, fast.	Then to the Duff Brewery.
The man never drank a Duff in his life.	I'd also like to express my fondness for that particular beer.
Like what?	What does the future hold for Duff? Let's just say we've got a few ideas up our sleeve.
Why not?	Um, I'd rather not get into it right now.
No.	All right, we don't have any ideas for the future. We got nothing. Happy?
Mmmm... Gummi Beer.	Hey, thanks a lot. That makes it all worthwhile.
Hey, Barney. I think you've had enough.	Mmmm... Gummi Beer.
Barney, give me your keys. You're too drunk to drive.	Are you crazy? We still haven't tried Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff, Tartar Control Duff...
Okay, you leave me no option.	I'm fine.
I'm trying to knock you out.	Ow. What was that for?
Gulp.	Look alive, boys. Coupla stewed prunes headed your way.
W,X,Y, AND Z / NOW I KNOW MY ABC'S / WON'T YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME?	Gulp.
Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record.	Your license is hereby revoked and you are to attend traffic school and two months of Alch-anon meetings.
Stupid bicycle. Can't believe this. No good, rotten...	Haw haw!
I guess it's not all bad.	Stupid bicycle. Can't believe this. No good, rotten...
It's funny `cause I don't know him. Heh, heh, heh.	"What a terrible waste. Hi! I'm actor, Troy McClure. You might remember me from such Driver's Ed films as ""Alice's Adventures through the Windshield Glass"" and ""The Decapitation of Larry Leadfoot."" For the next 60 minutes we'll be seeing actual film of car crash victims."
I'm here for the Alch-anon meeting.	It's funny `cause I don't know him. Heh, heh, heh.
My name is Homer and I'm just here because the court made me come.	My name is Hans. Drinking has ruined my life. I'm thirty-one years old.
Does the Lord count as a person?	Homie, do you ever drink alone?
Then, yes.	No.
Thank you, that'd be nice.	Do you need a beer to fall asleep?
Do I ever!	Do you ever hide beer around the house?
Ah.	Do I ever!
You name it.	Homie, I'd like you to do something for me.
You got it. No deer for a month.	I want you to give up beer for a month.
Deer.	Did you say beer or deer?
All right. Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month.	Please, Homie, I know you can do this.
"I was saying ""Pssst. I love you."""	What was that noise?
Well, beer... we've had some great times.	Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all.
WHEN I WAS 17 / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER I PURCHASED WITH A FAKE I.D. / MY NAME WAS BRIAN MCGEE / I STAYED UP LISTENING TO QUEEN	Well, beer... we've had some great times.
WHEN I WAS 17.	WHEN I WAS 17 / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER I PURCHASED WITH A FAKE I.D. / MY NAME WAS BRIAN MCGEE / I STAYED UP LISTENING TO QUEEN
Hm. Alcohol fueled car.	Dang, I was aiming for his head.
One for you... one for me... One for you... one for me...	Hm. Alcohol fueled car.
One down. Twenty-nine to go.	Lisa, every good scientist is half B.F. Skinner, and half P.T. Barnum. I don't think I need to see the other exhibits. First prize!
T.V. have you turned on me, too?	You thinking what I'm thinking?
I never realized how boring this game is.	The windup and the two two pitch... Oh no! The batter is calling for time... Looks like he's going and getting himself a new bat. And now there's a beachball on the field. And the ballboys are discussing which one of them is gonna go get it.
I think I've lost weight.	I never realized how boring this game is.
I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.	Don't be scared Jubjub. It's mama.
The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.	So Homer, please feel free to tell us anything. There's no judgment here.
Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer...	I cast thee out!
Nooooo!	Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug.
Thirty days!	Nooooo!
Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded.	I'm proud of you, Homie.
But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill...	You don't have to start drinking right away. I was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
Yoink.	You've saved more than a hundred dollars. I found it in your pants.
Put it in the fridge, Moe. I got a date with my wife.	Ow.
RAINDROPS KEEP FALLING ON MY HEAD...	Of course I'll be back. If you didn't close, I'd never leave.
It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life.	That is one evil dude.
I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.	Now stay tuned for professional wrestling, live from the Springfield Grapplarium! Tonight, a Texas death match... Dr. Hillbilly vs. the Iron Yuppie. One man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring!
Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That's where I got this scar.	Homer, Lisa needs Braces.
Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito?	Soon!
Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.	Bullseye!
If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces.	Lisa needs braces.
People stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth.	If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces.
And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan?	Hey!
You know what I think of this contract?	I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure.
Hey, what does this job pay?	Congratulations, Homer!
Woo hoo!	... Unless you're crooked.
And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.	This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
Mmm. Gratzi.	Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you.
Eh-Eh-Eh.	Don Homer, my son, he has trouble with the...
Molto bene.	Eh-Eh-Eh.
That's-a-nice-a-donut.	Molto bene.
Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me.	Do you think you can get the dental plan back?
Done and done! Heh, heh, heh.	Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish.
Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?	Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine.
Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no.	After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows.
Who is it?	Honey, you look fine.
Who?	Goons.
Hired goons?	Hired goons.
You know, you could have just called me.	Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you.
Hired goons?	Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons.
Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.	And this is my basement.
Which way to the bathroom?	It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon.
Nope. Nope. Nope.	Oh. It's the twenty-third door on the left.
Uh... yeah.	Find the bathroom alright?
I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.	A bug, I tell you! A bug!
Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh...	Because they love you down at the plant.
Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head.	That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough.	"We can always stick in a ""Photo Not Available"" card."
Who keeps saying that?	Nay.
Woo hoo!	Yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore.
BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER...	SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT /
Woo hoo!	All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union.
Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!	Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.
We're going back to work!	Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!
Haw haw. April Fool's.	Oh no, I can't see! I'm blind! Blind!
You talk better than you fool.	You're goin' down, Homer! I'm gonna fool you!
You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.	I'll fool you up real nice!
Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?	P.U.
God bless those pagans.	Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual.
Happy New Year!	The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
And that's the story of April Fool's Day.	Now who's laughing? Now who's laughing?
Oh, right.	Dad! I was telling the story.
Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will.	I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness.
Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were.	Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it...
So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?	Ay, no es bueno.
Mmmm... beer.	The following is a public service announcement. Excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum.
Marge!	Homie!
Arrrgh!	...You are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--
Arrrgh!	Arrrgh!
Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.	I won't jump anymore, I promise.
I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --	I love you, Dad.
I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--	I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --
You guys must have been pretty worried about me.	Shop around. You can't beat that price.
This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.	Hey, we know you're tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest?
Shhhh! Just watch.	This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.
Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!	Shhhh! Just watch.
Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him.	Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!
Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!	Right, Dad.
The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.	It's true. You have good coping skills.
Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe.	It was an amusing episode... of our lives.
No! No! Beer bring pain!	I brought you a little present.
Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed.	He really needs a girlfriend.
Marge!	Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through.
What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?	Marge!
Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.	Hey, what'll I tell the boss?
I can't.	You can do it, Homer. Stand up.
Mmm... chocolate.	He just won't budge. I've tried everything. Nothing can reach him.
Wow. Chocolate -- half price!	Mmm... chocolate.
Mmmm, chocolate.	Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
Oh, yeah.	Can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts.
Oof.	Hi, Dr. Nick!
Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.	You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through.
I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...	Please, do go on...
I thought maybe you...	Oh, please, continue...
Oh. Well, thanks for your time.	I thought maybe you...
No. Let me hear you play.	Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?
Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?	Why?
"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."	Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?
"OVER THERE."""	"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."
Why you little...	Dad, I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been a perfect kid...
What the...	Why you little...
They're fine.	Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?
Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.	And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me.
...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.	Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.
Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.	...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.
Why, you little --	It was just an April Fool's joke.
This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!	We're a family again!
Me lose brain? Uh-oh.	You lost five percent of your brain.
Why'd I laugh?	Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
Marge, it happened again!	It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.
Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.	Gee, that's odd. They didn't send one to you.
Marge, I never graduated from high school.	Oh my God.
"I never passed remedial science one ""A""."	Well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. Wait, maybe it does.
Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay.	And you're a nuclear technician?
I don't know. I flunked Latin, too.	What did you way?
Ah, my high school yearbook...	That's right, I did the Iggy.
You handsome devil.	Ah, my high school yearbook...
I can't believe I ate the whole thing.	You handsome devil.
"""Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none."" So many memories."	I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
"It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, ""The Fonz""..."	Time to go to the reunion.
No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back.	"That was ""Happy Days."""
Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown.	Oh, it's you Simpson.
Richard Nixon.	I am not a crook.
I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.	Jealous?
Hmmm.	I would.
The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave.	Grampa? Grampa?
Homer's not here, man.	Homer? Homer?
Ed Sullivan.	Okay, very good. Now, let's get on with our rilly big shew...
Oh my God!	Homer Simpson!
I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.	How'd you do it, Homer?
Yes!	And now, the award for most improved odor... Homer Simpson!
What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut...	And the person who traveled the least distance to be here... well, kiss my grits... Homer Simpson!
Marge, I have my pride. I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!	It fell in the toilet.
I never graduated from high school.	Dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect.
Oh, you have a job?	Hello, son! I was on my way home from work and thought I'd drop by.
I see.	They pay me eight hundred dollars a week to tell a cat and a mouse what to do.
All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar.	Dad, can we talk to Grampa alone for a minute?
Will this be on the test?	Welcome to Remedial Science 1A. My uh wife recently passed away... I thought teaching might ease my loneliness.
Nooooooo!	Now, I'm going to uh burn this donut to show you how many calories it has.
This is not happening. This is not happening.	The bright blue flame indicates this was a particularly sweet donut.
True.	All right, here are your exams. Fifty questions, true or false.
True.	Homer, I was just describing the test.
False.	Look, Homer, just take the test and you'll do fine.
All right, brain, you don't like me and I don't like you. But let's just do this and I can get back to killing you with beer.	False.
Marge! I passed!	I'll never watch an awards show again... unless that delightful Billy Crystal's involved.
At our next high school reunion I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.	That's wonderful, Homie!
Hello, Dondelinger.	At our next high school reunion I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
Not me!	HENS LOVE ROOSTERS/ GEESE LOVE GANDERS/ EVERYONE ELSE LOVES NED FLANDERS
Hey kids. How was school?	It's all so barbaric.
That's my boy.	I got expelled.
Mmmm, beer... What?	That's my boy.
No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school.	Look, Dad. I don't need school. I'll make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guv'nor?
Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one.	You're going to get an education. I'm going to teach you myself.
What's your problem?	Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one.
Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year.	Whacking Day is coming.
Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved.	But killing snakes is evil.
Whack!	Look what I got, Marge. A new whacking stick.
Whack! Whack! Whack!	Excuse me.
Yes, honey.	Dad, everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it. Is there something wrong with me?
Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that?	Then, what should I do?
Your Daddy hit the referee.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Yeah.
Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle.	OH WHACKING DAY / OH WHACKING DAY / MAY GOD BESTOW HIS GRACE ON THEE.
Woo hoo!	Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle.
Well, Marge,	Beautiful.
should I whack slow or fast?	Well, Marge,
Uh-oh.	Slow... then fast.
Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?	Dad please, for the last time, I beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob.
You mean there's a better way?	Until now, this was the only way to get juice from an orange.
Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink juice, lose weight. Won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore.	That's right. Order now and you'll also get Sun `n' Run, the Suntan Lotion... that's also a laxative!
Woo-Hoo!	Hey, dad. This came for you in the mail.
My name is Mr. Burns.	Who the devil are you?
Marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head.	There is no such thing.
"But, I'll miss ""Sheriff Lobo."""	Marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head.
I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...	... Flintstones' chewable morphine.
I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...	... Flintstones' chewable morphine.
Lobooo...	Morphine
Lobooo...	Morphine
Now, come on! I'm your best customer.	No offense, but we're putting that bitch on ice.
Mmm... pie.	No. In fact I can recite pi to 40,000 places. The last digit is one!
Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much. And it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning.	I'll be fine, dear.
Marge, please. I'm having enough trouble with the lobsters.	Homer, I don't think this fish is quite dead yet.
Now kids, while your mother's gone, I don't wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet.	Amazing!
We're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course.	Who's gonna change Maggie?
Go up to the attic. There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.	It seems like I've been wearing the same red dress forever.
Uh... no.	Oh honey, I've missed you too. Homer, is that an old Halloween costume?
Honey, I don't know what you're feelin' right now. So I don't wanna push anything. We can just hold hands... or sit and talk...	Doggone it.
He's dead now.	I ain't goin' nowhere. I been in this square pert near thirty seasons and I ain't a-leavin' now.
Yeah.	Did you see that?
I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo.	What's Gabbo?
I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain.	I don't think they're giving you enough information, Dad.
He'll tell us what to do.	I can't believe it. Our first glimpse of Gabbo!
WITH MY...	Whoa! Me rikey velly much. Oh, I hope I didn't offend you. I need this bad.
Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues.	Dad...
Hey, Moe, can I look too?	What?... What am I lookin' at? I don't see nothin'. I'm gonna stop looking soon... What... what, is that it?
My wallet's in the car.	Sure, but it'll cost ya.
Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out.	Uh-oh.
Oh, wait. That was the old sofa.	Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out.
Ooh, delicious.	You've got to keep working on it.
Ooh, five cents each!	It is, it really really is.
Junk... junk... the airplane's upside down... Strad-i-who-vius?...	Ooh, five cents each!
I'm surprised you don't remember, son. It was only eight years ago.	Dad, when did you record an album?
"Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left ""Saturday Night Live"" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet..."	What are we all laughing about?
Hello...	Hello...
Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild.	HELLO, MA BABY / HELLO, MA HONEY / HELLO, MA RAGTIME, RAGTIME GAL / SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE... ETC.
Bart, what did I tell you?	Barbershop! That ain't been popular since aught six, dagnabit!
"Rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. ""Achy Breaky Heart"" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop..."	BA-BY ON BOARD.
GOODBYE...	GOODBYE...
SO GOODBYE...	Oh my stars!
Really?	Homer, I'm a theatrical agent, and I want to represent your group.
Just leave it to me.	You've got... it! All except that police officer. Too Village People. You'll have to replace him.
Run along, boy. You're free now!	Where are we going? Where are we going?
The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement...	It is a great dishonor to my ancestors and my God, but okay.
Get off the stage!	OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM / EE-I-EE-I-O / AND ON THIS FARM HE HAD A CHICK / SWINGINGEST CHICK I KNOW / WITH A WIGGLE WIGGLE HERE AND A WIGGLE WIGGLE THERE...
It was one lousy applicant after another. And then...	This bird's gonna fly!
Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?	JUST A LITTLE IRISH DITTY...
The Be Sharps.	Perfect.
What'd you kids get?	well, can't blame a guy for trying. Aw, you're all under arrest.
Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years.	I bought this cool pencil holder.
Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire.	No one bought a wishbone necklace.
THERE WAS NOTHING IN AL CAPONE'S VAULT / BUT IT WASN'T GERALDO'S FAULT --	It'll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's...
Hmm... baby on board.	Look what I got. Now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.
BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself!	Hmm... baby on board.
Wait'll I tell Marge!	Gentlemen, you've just recorded your first number one.
Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand.	Oh yes, Bouffant Betty. Well I would prefer we kept your marriage a secret. You see, a lot of women are going to want to have sex with you, and we want them to think they can.
Come on, honey. It'll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden.	Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand.
Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives. I'll be the same loving father I've always been.	Homer, you're going to be famous!
I stuck him somewhere.	Have you seen Bart?
Look what I got for you, Dad.	I stuck him somewhere.
We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons.	Damned ceremonies. This is time I could be working, Mommy.
I meant the statue.	This enormous woman will devour us all!
We had fame and fortune.	Can we talk about Chief Wiggum?
Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.	We had fame and fortune.
Then came the greatest thrill of my life.	You're a musician?
Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie?	Hello, Homer. I'm George Harrison.
Oh man.	Over there. There's a big pile of 'em.
Lisa, did you see the Grammys?	Well, what a nice fellow.
Well, you haven't heard the last of them.	You beat Dexy's Midnight Runners!
I miss you too, honey.	Miss you, Daddy.
Oh. Thanks.	Here's the champagne you ordered, Mr. Simpson.
Here.	Oh. Thanks.
They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!	Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise! Lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam...
All the time. It was the title of our second album!	What'd you do... screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus?
But we were about to learn an iron law of show business: What goes up must come down.	All the time. It was the title of our second album!
Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--	So has Sinatra.
Shut up!	Ditto Tom Jones.
Hi, kids... I love	With your father on the road all the time I tried to compensate for his absence...
I pity the fool who doesn't like... he. And wher's Barney?	This is worse than your song about Mr. T.
Are we hot?	"Gentlemen, US Magazine just came out with its ""What's Hot and What's Not Issue."""
We all went our separate ways.	We are not.
Hey, fellas! I'm back.	Here you go.
I'll give her a good home.	Hey, Queenie, you can go now.
And I did.	I'll give her a good home.
I'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.	And I did.
There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed.	Since when could you write a song?
I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition.	... IT'S A TRIP TO PARADISE / WITH MY BA-BY... ON BOARD!
Oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! Oh wait, it's for Bart.	Bart, what's wrong with you?
Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt.	Hmm. This one's done in different handwriting.
It's probably the person you least suspect!	"But who'd want to hurt me? I'm this century's ""Dennis the Menace."""
Yeah.	That man is so rude.
Oh no!	Oh I'll stay away from your son, all right. Stay away, forever.
Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won't you join me in my kitchen?	Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without me knowing. And once a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and legal.
Go home.	Hiedilly-hey!
Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh.	... Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson, Lisa Simpson, that little baby Simpson. That is all.
Ooh! I wanna be John Elway.	Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson, we've helped hundreds of people in danger. We'll give you a new name, a new job, new identities.
Woo hoo!	"Thanks to Elway's patented last-second magic, the final score of Super Bowl 30: Denver - 7	 San Francisco - 56!"
Whup, two against one!	Woo hoo!
This isn't just because of Sideshow Bob. It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.	I don't think this is such a good idea.
Shut up, boy.	I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney sweep. Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster. Yeah!
Ooh, Ice Creamville.	We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville...
Check.	"Tell you what sir, from now on you'll be Homer Thompson at Terror Lake. Let's just practice a bit. When I say ""Hello, Mr. Thompson,"" you'll say, ""Hi."""
I got ya.	Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson.
No problem.	"Now when I say, ""Hello, Mr. Thompson"" and press down on your foot... you smile and nod."
I think he's talking to you.	Hello, Mr. Thompson.
EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...	THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL ARE WE / PERT AS A SCHOOLGIRL WELL CAN BE / FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH GIRLISH GLEE / THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL...
Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else.	The Thompsons!
I tied him up, out back.	Homer, where's the dog?
Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left.	We've left it all behind. How can you make a clean break with your life?
Aaah...	Not the elephants!
Bart! Don't interrupt!	Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!
Oh it is not.	Homer, this is serious.
BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?!	"Roman numeral three, surprise boy in bed... and a... disembowel him. No, I don't like that ""bowel"" in there. ""Gut him."" Ahh... Le mot juste."
Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy.	Dad, I'm kinda edgy right now. I'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife.
Nope.	Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy.
BARTDOYOUWANNASEEMYNEWCHAINSAWAND HOCKEYMASK?	Nope.
Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies.	"I knew I had to buy some time. So, I asked him to sing the score from ""The HMS Pinafore."""
Aw, no fair.	Take him away, boys.
Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee.	Duh, Homer, why are we down here?
You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy.	But why?
The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!	Yes, he's in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick.
What the hell are you talking about?	Homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. Now, we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you've got to tell me!	What the hell are you talking about?
Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.	Relax, it's just a simulator. Nothing can go wrong.
Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time.	I like to put my feet up.
So you want me to go to college?	Yes. He would.
Bart!	College? Barber or clown?
Maybe you're right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way.	I think this is a great opportunity. You could learn so much.
That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!	Homer, sign this application and you're a shoe-in.
C'mon! Gimme the hand, you stupid dog! C'mon! Gimme' that!	That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!
"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?"	"Dad, don't let these application essays throw you. Let's see... ""List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."""
Son of Sniglets??	No.
"Katharine Hepburn's ""Me""?"	No.
I suck.	No.
... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.	I suck.
Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch...	You the man, Homer.
Relax, a photo can't make any difference.	I dunno, Dad. Don't you have a better picture?
Sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that I really should watch.	Ah... steakey.
I hate that lousy dean!	Oh, don't worry, I've expelled those rowdy members of Chug-a-lug House.
Yes! Take that, Bitterman!	G-rrrrr!
Something I should have done a long time ago...	Well, Pop, what are you gonna do?
No, ma'am.	You don't know, do you?
Woo hoo, I'm a college man! I won't need my high school diploma anymore.	Smithers, dismember the corpse and send his widow a corsage.
I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T.	Woo hoo, I'm a college man! I won't need my high school diploma anymore.
My first day of college. I wish my father was alive to see this.	I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T.
How long have you been back there?	Hey!
Nerd!	Three days.
Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.	Homer, that isn't very nice.
Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?	Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.
I'll be a campus hero...	Pardon me?
Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt.	"Hi there, hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby. I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, I'm always up for some Hackey Sack.

You see that, sir. Drops his notes.	Now, we'll begin by - oops...
Do we have to?	Now, if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a comprehensive review session after every class.
Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!	No.
Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site.	Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.
"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works."	This proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it...
All right, I will.	Well please, come down and show us.
In there, guys.	All right, I will.
Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over.	Homer, no one blames you for the accident. We simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring. I researched these names myself...
Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head.	Hello?
Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor...	Stop the Humanoid!
"Heh heh. ""Nee."""	We are the Knights who say Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee!
We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.	"Heh heh. ""Nee."""
You take that back...	Listen to yourself, man. You're hangin' with nerds.
Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.	Homer, please. These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds.
Oh, not Souter... Oh, no.	"Dad, nerds are nothing to fear. In fact they've done some pretty memorable things. Some nerds of note include	 popcorn magnate, Orville Redenbacher, rock star, David Byrne and Supreme Court Justice David Souter."
I'll write it on my hand...	Come on, Mr. Simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table.
C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!	Ho. Including all known Lanthanides and Actinides? Good luck!
We're gonna go out and par-ty!	C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!
Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?	Me too.
But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good...	If you're going for a ride I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!	Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn't go.
I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.	I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!
Those bastards...	The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so they're our best target.
And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.	Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot...
What?	And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight...	What?
Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly...	Mr. Simpson, I don't think he likes that.
Ow! Why you little...	Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly...
Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled...	Oh, you'll pay. Don't think you won't pay.
Hey, that's not the wallet inspector.	Huh, I can't believe that worked.
Marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. They'll solve all our problems. They'll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth.	Hey, that's not the wallet inspector.
Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?	It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can't we do something?
Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.	You really think you can get us back into college?
I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.	Why does it have to be zany?
Perfect.	I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
Well, dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank.	Oh my.
And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.	Prank?
Yes, you have.	Well, I'm touched by your honesty. And who knows, perhaps I've been a bit of an ogre myself.
No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends.	We really want to thank you, Mr. Simpson.
Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams.	So, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam.
Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out.	What are you gonna do Mr. Simpson?
Whatever. Either way is good...	Or, with our help you could cram like you've never crammed before.
I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.	Aw, man, I can't believe you failed.
Computers can do that?	Mr. Simpson, there is a way. We could... well, use a computer to change your grade.
Mora wuza?	Oh yes. The only problem is the moral dilemma it raises... which requires...
"Oh, let's just say I had help from a ""little magic box..."""	"An ""A plus""! How did you do it?"
Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college.	Way to go, dad!
Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.	No we didn't.
Hmmm, true.	No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong.
Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean.	And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating.
Well, I guess it's back to college for me. And that means it's time to... What did I teach you guys?	Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean.
Yes.	Par-ty down?
Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!	Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers.
Oh no! Burns' Birthday!	What? Homie!
Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.	What's wrong?
Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!	Where is that dreaded piñata?
Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great.	Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esq material.
I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?	What are you doin'?
Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants.	Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.
Lisa, don't spoil our fun!	Does either of you know what incontinent means?
Okay, stupid!	Come on dear. It's time to go.
Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!	Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss.
Are you ready to laugh?	And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!
I said are you ready to laugh?!	Oh... That poor dog.
You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap...	Quiet, you awful man!
I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...	What!
Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky.	How dare you!
I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah.	Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky.
I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah.	I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, bla...	Destroy him.
Unghhhh!	Blah, bla...
Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.	This party is over.
Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.	Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.
Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.	It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.
Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!	Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.
Right. That makes sense.	Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!
No! Lemme go!	Right. That makes sense.
Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio.	"""Bobo"". It's Mr. Burns' bear all right."
Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun...	Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio.
Yes. We'll send the eye.	No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.	As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Sorry, Burns. No deal.	May I offer you a drink?
I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!	Don't worry, Smithers, he's playing hard ball now. But it won't take him long to crack.
I knew you'd come crawling back.	Nope.
A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones.	How much do you want?
Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.	Done. Now, give me that bear.
It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie!	Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.
The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here.	Here you go, Maggie.
Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay.	You've made a mistake, Simpson.
Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese.	Yes.
Sixty four... sixty three...	Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese.
I think I'm blind.	Have you been up all night eating cheese?
Right here.	Excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money.
My life can't get any worse.	Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.
After lunch can I whip you?	Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties.
Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!	After lunch can I whip you?
See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do...	Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!
Do do do do doo...	See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do...
No! My box! My box!	Do do do do doo...
Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.	I think we need a new hairdryer.
Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul.	I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.
Box...	Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul.
I can see why this is so popular.	TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR....
That's right.	What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer?
Oh, Barney, leave me alone.	Homer, give him what he wants.
Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!	Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse?
I love this show	Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!
Well well, look whose come to apologize.	I love this show
But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's.	Please... please.
Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?	Eh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it.
Oooh, pure genius...	And next in our fall catalogue: we love this, it is a vision in raspberry cream.
Oh. Pure genius. And now to make the leap from dreams to reality.	Oooh, pure genius...
All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.	Damn buzzards! I ain't dead yet.
Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He's always one step ahead. Oh, I'd sell my soul for a donut!	All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.
Flanders! You're the devil?	Well, that can be arranged.
Do you have a donut or not?	It's always the one you least suspect! Now many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting upon the grave ramifica...
Hey, wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?	Now remember: the instant you finish it, I own your soul for --
I'm smarter than the de-vil! I'm smarter than the dev-	Technically no, but --
Not likely. Heh, heh.	You are not smarter than me! I'll see you in Hell yet, Homer Simpson!
Mmmm... forbidden donut.	Not likely. Heh, heh.
No.	Homer?! Did you eat that donut?
Eh, that wasn't so bad.	Oh you Americans with your due process and fair trials. This is always so much easier in Mexico. All right. Very well. We'll have the trial tomorrow at the stroke of midnight. 'Til then, you're going to spend the day in hell.
Uh, huh.	So, you like donuts, eh?
More. Mmmm.	Well! Have all the donuts in the world!!
No.	Homer! Are you all right?
Woo hoo! Ow!	No.
But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work.	Homer, stop picking at it.
Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy's boat!	Lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. Don't worry, honey, the scary part's over.
They're dogs! And they're playing poker!	We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.
Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos.	A vampire!
Hmmm... business deal.	Precious blood.
It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania.	Hmmm... business deal.
Sure did.	Lisa, stop being so suspicious. Did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked?
Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.	Dad, do you notice anything strange?
It was the boy!	I heard that!
Huh, ooooh, punch!	It was the boy!
Correction. Free blood.	Eww, Dad, this is blood.
Ahhh.	Correction. Free blood.
Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is.	Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence.
Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.	Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here.
Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?	The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns.
Super Fun Happy Slide!	This is dangerous. I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie.
I guess killing will be fun enough.	No, Dad.
Take that, vile fiend!	You must drive this stake right through his heart.
Oh, sorry.	Uh, Dad, that's his crotch.
You have to kill the head vampire.	But, no, we killed Mr. Burns.
What the hell's so funny?	Well sir, it has been an uneventful week in Badger Falls, where the women are robust, the men are pink-cheeked and the children are pink-cheeked and robust.
Stupid TV. Be more funny.	Maybe it's the TV.
Heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!	What the hell...? Oooh, we got a call.
Marge, it's public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es?	I'd like to pledge thirty dollars. Oh, thank you!
The ballet? Woo hoo!	They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet.
Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. Ahhh, ballet.	You like ballet?
All right, but remember it's mine.	That's one right there.
That's what ballet is?	All right, but remember it's mine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum.	Mr. Simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?
Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it.	Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum.
I can't. I gotta take my wife to the ballet.	Hey, Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?
Mmmm... invisible cola.	Gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh?
Heh, heh. Time to stick it to the man.	Mmmm... invisible cola.
Phht, that's just an old wives tale.	Hey careful there, Homer. I heard somebody lost an arm in there once.
Errrrghh... just...a little more. Got it!	Phht, that's just an old wives tale.
I'm stuck! Help me!	Errrrghh... just...a little more. Got it!
Must... get to ballet...	Let's get outta here!
promised Marge...	Must... get to ballet...
Hello? Can I get some help? Snack related mishap!	promised Marge...
Mmmmm, candy.	Hello? Can I get some help? Snack related mishap!
Marge, this may be hard to believe, but I'm trapped inside two vending machines.	Hello?
I'm going to have these things on my arms forever!	Yeah right, we'd better turn in. Oh, you were serious.
Candy and sodas for all!	I'm going to have these things on my arms forever!
Mmmm... convenient.	Candy and sodas for all!
They'll grow back, right?	Homer, this is never easy to say. I'm gonna have to saw your arms off.
Your point being?	Homer, are you just holding onto the can?
Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. That's why I had the fireman write me a note.	Hey, can I throw up in your bathroom? I'll buy somethin'.
Lumber has a million uses.	"""Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."""
Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman.	I'm disappointed in you, but it turns out I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers. In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night.
Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!	Heh, heh. Oh Marge, we should do this every Thursday.
Marge, you can't go out on Saturday. That's our special night.	Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!
"What the... Oh, I don't know... a little show called ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman""?!"	What's so special about it?
When will you be home?	I don't know.
Where you going?	I'm not sure.
Will you bring me back something?	You already asked me that.
How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children?	Don't wait up.
Man's best friend, indeed.	Rock the Casbah!
Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?	I am lucky. I have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much.
That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.	Sure Dad.
Fine! I can have a great time all by myself!	Hello? Hello? Hellodilly-odilly?
"Oh Lisa, haven't you seen ""Home Alone?"" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."	Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter.
Wait a second...	You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a baby-sitter.
You kids do need a baby-sitter.	Wait a second...
Here you g... Nnnnnno.	Blast that infernal card! Don't give that card to me.
We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.	Mr. Simpson. I was just going through your garbage and I couldn't help overhearing that you need a baby-sitter. Of course being a highly skilled attorney, my fee is one hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour.
Two.	Three.
Done.	Okay, two. And I get to keep this old bird cage.
Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.	Oh, did you? Oh I completely misunderstood. Please accept our apologies.
Hi guys!	Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
Moe, get the darts. I want to play.	Hi guys!
"Ooooh, ""Jet!"""	Oh, that's nice.
Woo hoo! It's Garret Morris' birthday.	"Ooooh, ""Jet!"""
Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!	Homer, stop that! It's just a weather station.
You got real purdy hair.	Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!
Ah, young love.	Okay. I should get home to my daughter before that naked talk show comes on.
The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!	Ah, young love.
It's just no fun without Marge.	The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!
My wife's having a girls' night out.	What are you doing here?
I miss you, Marge.	Eh, just get one of those inflatable women. But make sure it's a woman... 'Cause one time I... Eh come on, I'll uh... I'll give you a ride home.
"""A lot of blue hair?"" Heh-heh. What a freak."	We're in pursuit of two female suspects. One is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair.
It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal, just because I didn't take her to the ballet.	"""A lot of blue hair?"" Heh-heh. What a freak."
Really?	That's exactly how Dillinger got started.
That's them!	Mmmm, engine block eggs. If we can keep these down, we'll be sittin' pretty.
Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!	Oh no, they're headed right for the Grand Chasm.
Marge! Marge!	Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.	Homer?!
But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!	You're right. I am lucky to have him.
Solid waste, I could kiss you.	Ha! And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill.
Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza.	Solid waste, I could kiss you.
Woo hoo!	Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States Army neuro-chemical research center at Fort Meade Maryland for extensive testing.
Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.	Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him.
Ahh, the daily newspaper.	Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.
Oooh! The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!	Ahh, the daily newspaper.
OH MY GOD!	"Why do you read that ""Free"" column, Homer? They never have anything good."
Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!	What is it?
Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE.	Please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
Huh?	Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE.
Krusty!	Hey! That seltzer ain't free.
Yeah. What's the deal?	That's me. You here for the trampoline?
And I can just haul it away? Free?	Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing it out for more dirty limericks. There once was a man named Enos --
Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son.	You're a good dog, arencha, boy? Arencha?
Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!	I don't know if this is a good idea.
Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.	Are you sure it's safe?
No it doesn't!	It smells funny in there.
Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump.	Stop jumping on me! I'm hurt!
Okay, okay. I'll take care of it.	Homer, this is terrible!
All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!	I told you this was a bad idea!
Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the...	All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!
There we go.	You just keep right on drivin'.
That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.	There we go.
Yep, it's finally gone.	That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now.	Yep, it's finally gone.
I'm thirsty.	If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now.
All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust.	Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline.
Rust I tell ya.	All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust.
Uh-huh.	Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?
Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!	Let's jump on the car instead.
Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.	That's not true.
That's not fun!	I can name ten things! I... I made sloppy Joes...
See, Marge?	Um... Uh, well... Uh...
What up, Marge?	Sorry, it does that sometimes.
Marge, can I go outside and play?	I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
And that sends me into a shame spiral.	That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script.
Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.	Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad.
And I feel that you hear my shame.	I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
I feel validated by that.	I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.
Me too.	Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."""	Me too.
Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?	Brad Goodman is coming to town!
I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.	We know, Dad.
It sure does!	Food goes in here.
Thank you. Very, very much.	That means no, eh? I'm not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. Mama, Papa -- could you come up here?
This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.	Arr! This picture'll serve me well on those lonely nights at sea.
Hey, I hear ya, buddy.	I didn't feel like it.
Hey, boy! In here!	Eep.
Hold on, son.	Hey, boy! In here!
So long, suckers!	Hold on, son.
No, we're not.	They're headin' for the old mill!
Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.	"""That's a good idea."" ""Cider!"" ""To the mill! There's a good view!"""
That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.	No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.	That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain.	You tell me, Chief. You had a pretty good view from behind your desk.
It means he gets results, you stupid chief.	What does that mean, exactly?
Oh, I'm sorry.	Dad, sit down.
Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites.	You mustn't kill time, boys -- you must cherish it! Seize the day! Can I have some change, to go get loaded?
"""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm."	Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites.
Steak?	Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner.
Steak?	Money's too tight for steak.
Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.	Sure, steak.
Uh oh. Something's wrong.	Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha!	Uh oh. Something's wrong.
Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut.	Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha!
Explain how.	Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut.
Woo hoo!	Explain how.
Mmmmm... free goo.	It's a hell-of-a--- towwwnnn!!
Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel.	"I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies."
Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons.	They won't let you have any fun.
You're right, Marge. Good work, boy.	Homer, you should be more supportive.
Egghead likes his bookie wook!	You're right, Marge. Good work, boy.
Just tucking him in.	Homer!
Oooh, floor pie.	Hmmm...
BART!!!! Mmm... apple.	Hmm.
Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart.	Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?
How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh?	Yay!
Stupid poetic justice...!	How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh?
Heh heh. You don't have a son.	Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip.
I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes.	Look, Homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. Then it'll be his fault.
Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip.	I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes.
Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!	Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me!
I'll take it.	Arrr, here be a fine vessel. The yarest river-goin' boat there be.
Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders.	Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft.
Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible.	Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought?
Hey, there's a new Mexico.	Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible.
So many Krustyburger locations.	Oh, quick, Homer! Which way do we turn--?
Wrong again, Flanders.	Paddle harder, Homer. We gotta fight the current.
In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land.	Wrong again, Flanders.
Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!	Hey! I got that for my birthday!
"Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? ""Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."""	Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope.
Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!	Homer! No!
Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!	Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die.
Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing.	Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?
Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so:	Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing.
Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.	STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD!
This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing...	A rescue plane! Get the flare gun!
All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us.	This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing...
Flanders! Snap out of it!	Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily...
It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.	Dad, I think he's oka--
You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.	You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food.
He'll be back.	Godspeed, li'l doodle.
Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting.	He'll be back.
Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now.	Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting.
I stole it from that Borgnine guy.	A real Swiss army knife. Cool!
Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...	Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug.
The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.	Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence.
According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!	Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too.
Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time!	That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!
Give seven hundred Krustyburgers!	Close the damn thing down! No one's ever gonna come.
Go away. Eating.	You did it, Dad! You saved us! I'm proud you're my father.
Watch this, guys.	You mean it ain't me noggin, it's me peepers? Well that's just loverly.
And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.	And we can't take off our pants when it gets real hot.
I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did.	And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
Hi.	Yeah, ditto.
Gotta go.	Ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
What the hell was that? I probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in the parking lot.	Gotta go.
Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens.	So am I.
You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke.	Have a good night, Homer.
So uh, what do you guys think of Mindy?	Not a good sign.
Yeah. That Mindy seems real nice.	Seems okay. Anybody see the game last night?
Mindy has a motorcycle.	Yeah, usually you just take the box of donuts into the bathroom.
Moe, I need your advice.	Get 'em!
See, I got this friend named... Joey Joe Joe Junior... Schabadoo.	Yeah.
Oh, what the hell, it's me. I'm attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?	Hey, Joey Joe Joe!
Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?	"""Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common."""
Uh, so. Let's have a conversation. Uh, I think we'll find we have very little in common.	It was on one of these bar napkins.
Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze.	Can't talk... eating.
Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV.	Double glaze.
Me too.	Not me. That's my idea of heaven.
Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too.	Really? I can see I'm gonna love working with you. Well, gotta go. I wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch.
I made it the whole day without seeing her again.	Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too.
I mean hello!	I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.	I guess we'll be going down together. I mean getting off together. I mean...
That's unsexy.	That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.
Ew.	That's unsexy.
Well, this is my floor.	Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts.
Arr - see ya tomorrow.	Well, this is my floor.
Ah, home to my loving family. What more can a man ask for?	Arr - see ya tomorrow.
Uhhh.	Hi, Hober. Dote kiss be, I'b all stuffed up.
Hi, son. Howya... ewww.	Hi, Dad.
Yeah, good.	Dad, look, I made fish sticks. They're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out.
Let's have a little quality time together, just you and me.	That raccoon stole my lamb chop.
Hey! We haven't watched TV in awhile.	Oh that's sweet. Guess what. There's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a T-shirt. I got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
Hello hotline? I am very tempted by another woman.	Examine your scalp for ringworm.
Nooo!	Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?
Who are you?	Nooo!
Sir Isa-who?	Homer, I'm your guardian angel. I've assumed the form of someone you would recognize and revere - Sir Isaac Newton.
Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?	Oh, very well.
Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?	I'm not actually Col. Klink. I'm just assuming his form.
Ooh, I would live in a big mansion?	Ho-MER! That's not why I'm here. My job is to show you how miserable life would be if you married Mindy instead of Marge.
I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?	I'm so happy, darling.
Then we're all happy.	Yes, sir. Quite.
Marge lives here?	Sure, life is good for you, but what about Marge?
OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING. BUT I SENT YOU BEN-GAY, OH ANDY, YOU KISSED ME AND STOPPED ME FROM SOMETHING, AND I...	Excelsior!
Uh oh.	OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING. BUT I SENT YOU BEN-GAY, OH ANDY, YOU KISSED ME AND STOPPED ME FROM SOMETHING, AND I...
Um, because I have a small role in a Broadway musical. It's not much, but it's a start.	Dad, why are you singing?
Like what?	Are you hiding something from me?
Lisa, look out behind you!	Judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named Mindy... or a man named Andy.
No, Lisa, I swear to you. I'm one-hundred percent completely serious. You've got to turn around right now before it's too late.	Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that.
Sucker.	Huh?
Mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on.	Sucker.
Mindy!	Hi, Homer.
Oh no! I'm sweating like Roger Ebert.	Mindy!
Uh, Murphy, you are elf a controllably I think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo.	Oh no! I'm sweating like Roger Ebert.
Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?	Come on, I'll get you the tickets.
Heh heh heh. Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?	What is it? Do you have a question?
Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.	"TV's there	 bathroom's there	 and there's your king sized bed for..."
Free mouthwash! Free shampoo! Free shower curtain!	Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.
Mindy?	Free shower curtain!
Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. Heh heh.	Wow, if it weren't for this wall we'd be sleeping in the same bed.
Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.	Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
Oh!	No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service!
Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed.	I can't believe we ordered so much.
Mmmm... foot long chili dog.	Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed.
Go to hell!	No more Chernobyls!
Heh, you know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but I think as long as we're not alone together...	Go to hell!
Huh?	And now the moment you've been waiting for. This year's King and Queen of Energy are... Homer Simpson and Mindy Simmons!
Is there any way to get out of this?	Homer, Mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone, at Madame Chao's, the sexiest Chinese restaurant in Capital City!
Oh yeah.	What a perfect evening. It was sure nice of them to make us cheeseburgers.
Well I guess you'll want to come in.	"Well, open up the ""stick with your wife"" barrel."
Okay.	Okay.
Yeah, yeah.	This was a really nice night, Homer.
Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.	What's wrong?
Yes we do. The cookie told me so.	Oh... well, we don't have to.
But they're so sweet.	Well, desserts aren't always right.
Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I'd just like to...	Homer, you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Oh, baby.	Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want.
Mmmm... Marge.	Hey, there's a turkey behind the bed.
Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.	I'm old. Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Anybody lose their glasses? Last chance. Woo hoo!	Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.
The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.	Anybody lose their glasses? Last chance. Woo hoo!
Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.	Dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you.
And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.	This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield.
Shhh. I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.	Dad, what do you think?
I got a job at Burns' casino. As you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer.	Why?
We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.	"Your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on ""The Gong Show."" And you did it in 1977, remember?"
Uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again.	Hey! I said bug off!
Why thanks, Senator! Oop, looks like my shift is over.	Yee ha! Homer, I want you to have my lucky hat. I wore it the day Kennedy was shot, and it allllways brings me good luck!
Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.	Hi, Homie.
Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, and I have a photographic memory.	I was for the casino!
Y'ello?	For you. It's the President.
And then I said to the president... get this Marge? Marge?	Y'ello?
Twenty- one? Do that card-counting thing again! Come on. Do it again.	Behold the box of mystery! The cat goes in... uh...
No! Please, please, please, please, please...	Definitely have to leave the table.
No!	Gotta watch Wapner. Leave the table. Yeah, leave the table.
Marge, you waited for me.	Ewww!
Marge, I'm taking the car.	I'll catch up to you.
This late? Through the bad neighborhood?	I'll walk.
Marge...	Yeah.
Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. Well, that's just sad.	Go home. You're bad luck!
You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust.	There's nothing to eat for breakfast.
Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom.	Maybe Mom just doesn't realize we miss her. We could go down to the casino and let her know.
Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem...	Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom.
Woo hoo! Problem solved!	I won sixty dollars last night.
Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?	Mommm!
Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it.	I just had a bad dream.
Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!	Well, I know it's absurd, but I dreamed the Boogeyman was after me and he's hiding...
Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may be a Boogeyman or Boogeymen in the house!	Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!
Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid.	What happened here?
Aw. Just like on TV.	Thanks, Mom.
Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that she has a career, now. She's a slot jockey.	Dad, Mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the Geography Pageant is tonight.
It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this.	But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of Florida, I'll be the laughing stock of the whole school.
Ow...ow...ow...ow.	It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!	Ow...ow...ow...ow.
Oh yeah, the costume.	Dad!
Hello, Floreeda.	Oh yeah, the costume.
No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws.	I'm not a state, I'm a monster!
Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn this casino!	No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws.
You broke a promise to your child.	Think before you say each word.
You promised Lisa to help her with her costume. You made her cry, then I cried. Then Maggie laughed. She's such a little trooper.	What?
Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.	Lisa's costume. Homer, I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.
No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it anymore.	You know, you're right, Homer. Maybe I should get some professional help.
Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.	Yes, of course you are.
You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem.	Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.
Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?	That's true. Will you forgive me?
Aw, what a gyp.	Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that.
Oh yeah. I forgot already.	Homer!
Woo hoo!	Wake up, Dad! Wake up! There was a burglar and he took my saxophone.
Eh, that's no big loss.	And my necklace.
Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.	Homer! That necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.
Shhh, quiet Lisa.	Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. That saxophone was my one creative outlet. It was the only way I could truly express myself.
Curse you, Magic Beans.	Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance.
Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery!	Oh, stop blaming the beans.
Let me check my reason list.	Ow, my jugular! Any questions?
Yep. It's on here.	Let me check my reason list.
Alright, these are our new family security rules: Be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows.	Thank you for coming. I'll see you in Hell.
Marge, they're only human.	And don't take candy from strangers.
Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument.	What's the point of all these precautions? I've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down.	What, this jug?
You know Lisa, music helps daddy think.	Thank you.
I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?	Hey, you're that drunken posse. Wow, can I join you?
I'm someone else!	Yeah! Someone else! Someone else! Someone else!
We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences.	He's right!
Sorry, Dad. You're too old.	I'll join! I'm filled with piss and vinegar. At first I was just filled with vinegar...
Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are...	And a fine job ye did too!
Marge, we're responsible adults and...	I don't think the guns are a good idea, Homer.
... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...	Oops.
"Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I'll be ""Cueball."" Skinner can be ""Eightball"", Barney will be ""Twelveball,"" and Moe, you can be ""Cueball."""	Sorry.
No, we're forming a vigilante group.	So, wedding, huh?
Put this in your pipe and smoke it.	Radiant cool crazy nightmare. Zen New Jersey nowhere.
Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!	How now brown bureaucrats.
Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!	Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
Sorry.	Hey, see this sign?
Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town.	Sorry.
You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big.	Meaning what exactly?
Bart, give me that megaphone of yours.	You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big.
Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.	It's not just a megaphone, Dad. It's a RapMaster 2000.
Move along there.	Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
Return to your homes and places of businesses!	It's Hammer!
Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?	Return to your homes and places of businesses!
Get him!	Sears.
No burning leaves without a permit!	Get him!
Too late.	I got one.
You better have a good reason for doing that, boy.	Too late.
You're in. Here's the sack.	It makes me feel like a big man.
"So I said to him, ""Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""	But you gotta supply your own knobs.
I 'unno. Coast Guard?	Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?
Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas.	And I still don't have my saxophone.
Literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...	Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas.
Oh, that might be a typo.	World domination?
Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that.	Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charge that petty vandalism such as graffiti is down 80 percent, while heavy sack beatings are up a shocking 900 percent?
Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.	I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
Y'ello.	Hello, Kent. Hello, Homer, my arch nemesis.
Uh... Marge?	Uh, you do realize who this is...
Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!	No, Homer, I'm not your wife, although I do enjoy her pearls. As a matter of fact, I'm holding them right now. Listen.
Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.	Homer, that's our stage manager!
Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time.	It may interest you to know that for my next crime I'll be pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia.
We'll be right back.	Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time.
Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything.	Son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg.
Hey!	Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything.
He'll show.	Any sign of the burglar yet?
It's his job.	How's that?
He's a burglar.	How's that?
Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!	He's a burglar.
Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep! I was drunk!	Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do.	I believe you, Dad.
Nooooo!	You let me down, man. Now I don't believe in nothing no more. I'm going to law school.
Oh, this doesn't work any more.	Dad, maybe this will cheer you up.
I didn't say stop.	Oh, this doesn't work any more.
Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.	I couldn't quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
No wait! I know where the burglar is!	Well kiss me right here. It's the only part that still has feeling.
So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him.	What an eyesore.
Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.	Homer old chum. Well done. If anyone was going to catch me, I'm glad it was you.
I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar.	You just, you couldn't have picked a worse time.
Shut up.	I suppose you're wondering where I hid all the millions of dollars I stole over the years.
No kidding.	It's buried right here in Springfield, under a Big T.
Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep.	Big T, huh?
Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There's millions of dollars buried under a Big T!	Yeah, me too. I will also go home for sleep.
It's mine!	It's just a piece of paper.
"""Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes."" Oh, I can't make out this signature."	It's mine!
We'll dig our way out!	Uh, how're we gonna get outta here?
"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse."	No, no! Dig up, stupid!
Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge.	Why are you so happy?
Just a minute! Don't hang up! Y'ello... you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel.	No answer at home. I'll call his father.
What do you mean you lost him?! He might have fallen into one of these machines!	Ayy yi yi! No me gusta! Ay, it's grande.
Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!	What do you mean you lost him?! He might have fallen into one of these machines!
He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!	Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!
Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news.	A powerful tidal wave in Kuala Lumpur has killed one hundred and twenty people. Ai chihuahua! Whoa whoa whoa!
Oh, nothing.	Hi, Homer.
That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!	I've got a weekend job helping the poor. And I'm only eight.
Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.	Well...
Hello, everybody. I'm Archie Bell and I'm also the Drells. We got a new song called, 'Tighten Up' and this is the music you tighten up with.	Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.
Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man.	Hey, Pepe, go for the face!
Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig.	Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job.
It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters.	That's for taking credit for other people's work.
Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today.	Thanks Dad, that's great advice.
Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that uniform.	But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot. And the last two chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.
Come on, Lisa. Say something funny.	Yayyyyy!
Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. Something like that.	Like what?
Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid.	Obnoxious fad?
What the hell are you readin' books for?	Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid.
"Don't forget to say ""I didn't do it""."	I'm doing the Conan O'Brien show and I wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.
How do you figure boy?	Dad, there's more to me than just a catchphrase.
All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out you know.	Watch the Conan O'Brien show. You'll see.
That dog can sell anything.	One at a time! No Teamsters!
What kind of catchphrase is that?	If anyone wants me I'll be in my room.
Woo hoo! Cheap meat!	Well, this time I've gone too far. No, no one will fall for...
Oooh, this one's open!	Woo hoo! Cheap meat!
Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... Not much time. Must finish.	Oooh, this one's open!
Your old meat made me sick!	Hey, we've just been workin' the eyes.
This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.	I'm so sorry. Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.
Woo hoo!	Okay, ten pounds.
Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?	"Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home expose: ""Geezers in Freezers."" It turns out the rest home was adequately heated, the footage you saw was of a fur storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term ""Geezers."" Now coming up next, ""The Case of the Cantankerous Old Geezer."""
Bor-ing.	If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number...
Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking.	Dad, are you listening to me?
No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire.	All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?
Oh, that I'll wear.	All right, all right, all right. Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?
Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat.	He's not kiddin'.
Bee? Aah!	Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet.
One hot dog please.	Hot diggity dog! We've got him, Mr. Simpson. Now lets -- Mr. Simpson?
It's true, it's true. We're so lame.	Yo, check this out. Black guys drive a car like this. Yeah, but white guys, see they drive a car like this.
Oh.	Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village this is the traditional pose of apology.
You're selling what now?	You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends. At first I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt. I am at your service.
You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.	I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
Is he still out there?	He's got me there.
What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...	Yes, he's raking leaves.
Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?	If he wants to make it up to you so badly, I think you should let him.
Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?	I can see through time.
Outrageous.	A napkin.
Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there.	Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. What the...?
Pass the chutney.	Hey, don't jerk me around, fella.
That's even worse than the album Grampa released.	And he taught me how to play the shenai.
Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.	Thank you all for the kind praise.
Ub. Apu friend me good.	Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.

THAT KWIK-E-MART'S A REAL... .	LET'S HURL A BRICKY-MART!
Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.	NOT ME!
And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.	I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
Hey, what's that sound?	And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.
Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that.	WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART? I DO.
I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along.	I must go to the head office and appeal my case.
Okay.	But, sir, the head office is in India.
I'm aware of that.	Dad... That's over ten thousand miles away.
Are we in India yet?	I'm sorry we couldn't take a cab, but I spent my last dollar on the plane tickets.
Are we in India yet?	No.
Are we in India yet?	No.
Are we in India yet?	No.
This isn't very convenient.	There she is, there she is, the world's first convenience store.
Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?	That's great, because all I need is one.
Really?	Yes.
You?	Yes.
Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?	Thank you, come again.
No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours.	Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Okay, Apu, I accept your apology.	No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours.
Fine. Oh, I mean not good.	How did it go?
Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.	Do you mind? I'm not in the mood.
Hey, let's all hug Apu.	Yes... yes, a movie, yes.
Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again.	Awww.
Woo hoo!	And to my son, Homer...
Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them.	Ya see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in zeppelins dropping coins on people. And one day, I seen J.D. Rockefeller flyin' by, so I run out of the house with a big washtub and... Where're you goin'?
Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!	"...we'd always have ""Walking Bird"" on Thanksgiving. ... With all the trimmings: cranberries, Injun eyes, and yams stuffed with gunpowder. Then we'd all watch football, which in those days was called 'baseball.'"
Ah, come on, Marge, you're way too...	That toy isn't safe for a baby like Maggie.
ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!..	All right, come on, pops. Soldiers won't bother you anymore.
ROCK! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK-A, ROCK, ROCK! ROCKAROCKROCK!	ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!..
WE'RE GONNA ROCK, GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TO-NIGHHHTTT!	ROCK! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK-A, ROCK, ROCK! ROCKAROCKROCK!
Thank you, thank you very much!	Boo!
Marge, that's what I bought it for!	Hm. I don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
Yes. But there's more.	Why are you people avoiding me? Does my withered face remind you of the grim specter of death?
Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya.	Yes. But there's more.
And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.	Yeah, you made us march in that Gay Rights Parade.
I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are.	It's rotten being old. No one listens to ya.
I'unno.	Dad, did you hear something?
Marge, Lisa, Lady -- If you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to attend to.	Oh, nothing. Kudos to you, Lisa! Kudos!
Hey.	Hey, Homer.
Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time.	Except forrrrr...
"Union rule twenty-six - ""Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""	Yeah, how come?
Stupid carbon rod. It's all just a popularity contest.	Inanimate huh? I'll show him inanimate!
Nobody respects me at work.	I'm sorry, Homie.
What, what does it say? I want to see.	Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull.
Ah, TV respects me. It laughs with me, not at me.	What, what does it say? I want to see.
Boring.	Unbelievable! And just imagine the logistics of weightlessness. And of course this could have literally millions of applications here on Earth... in everything from watch making to watch repair.
No, the batteries!	Boring.
Make it stop!	And we laugh legitimately. There's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.
I can't! I can't!	Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!
Hello, is this NASA?	God, I wish there was an easier way.
Good. Listen, I'm sick of your boring space launches. Now I'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV...	Yes.
Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.	How did you get this number?
Hello, is this President Clinton? Good. I figured if anyone knew where to get some Tang it'd be you... shut up!	People, our long search is over.
No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him.	Are you the person that called NASA yesterday?
Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE.	Well, welcome aboard. I think you'll find that this will win you the respect of your family and friends.
I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell.	Uh... question for the barbecue chef: don't you think there is an inherent danger in sending under-qualified civilians into space?
I'll take care of this.	Careful, they're ruffled!
And may the best man win. He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.	I'll take care of this.
Less shame?	No, not that far from shame.
Who's doin' what now?	You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions. First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. But now I realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do.
"Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney ""Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President"" Gumbel."	Who's doin' what now?
Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket	I AM THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL / I'VE INFORMATION VEGETABLE, ANIMAL, AND MINERAL.
I can't stands no more.	Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket
Mmmmm. Mediciney.	I can't stands no more.
Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition.	So Barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.
You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!	There's no swimsuit competition, Homer.
Congratulations, Barney.	Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard, and in a way you're both winners. But in another more accurate way, Barney is the winner.
Default? Woo hoo! The two sweetest words in the English language. De-fault! De-fault! De-	Well, Homer. I guess you're the winner by default.
Nooooo!	The preceding program contained scenes of extreme violence and should not have been viewed by young children.
Marge, I don't really want to go through with this... But being an astronaut is how I got you to respect me.	Nooooo!
Oh.	Homer, you already dialed.
Ants!	But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life.
Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.	Mission control, this is Corvair, launch sequence initiated. All systems go.
It's beautiful. It's the most awe inspiring sight I have ever seen.	I don't know. All this equipment is just used to measure TV ratings.
... giver of life, mother of us all.	It's beautiful. It's the most awe inspiring sight I have ever seen.
Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard.	... giver of life, mother of us all.
Wow! Former president James Taylor.	Some good news, gentlemen, we have quite a treat for ya. We've been able to coax superstar James Taylor in here at mission control to wish you well and play a little of his own brand of laid back adult contemporary music.
And that is that.	All right, here we go: three, two, one, make hatch blow...now!
No!	And that is that.
Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.	With that hatch open, we'll burn up on reentry. That's it! If I go, I'm taking you to hell with me.
Stupid bar.	Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.
I'll bash you good.	Wait, Homer. If that bar holds, we just might make it back to earth.
OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ CRISPY CRUNCHY GRAHAM CEREAL BRAND NEW BREAKFAST TREAT.	By the way, the spacecraft is still in extreme danger. May not make it back. Attempting risky reentry... Blah blah blah blah blah. We'll see you after the movie.
Stupid rod. I got gypped.	Aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod.
Yeah, maybe I do have the right... what's that stuff? Anyway, thanks, Marge, Lisa.	Yeah, Dad. How many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?
See because of me, now they have a warning.	Warning: Tickets should not be taken internally.
Woo hoo! Sold!	Hey, Dad... sell you these for fifty bucks.
"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig."	Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer.
I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore.	"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig."
Heh-heh-heh, I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work.	I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore.
In theory, yes. Jerk.	With the money you would have made working, you could've bought tickets from a scalper.
Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!	"That was Bobby McFerrin's new one, ""I'm Worried, Need Money!"" Okay, if you want two tickets to the big Pigskin Classic just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller!"
Oh stupid sheep.	Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders.	Ned Flanders...
I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...	I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / WON'T YOU PACK YOUR BAGS TO LEAVE TONIGHT /
Excellent guitar riff.	I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...
Why am I such a loser? Why?	Excellent guitar riff.
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts.	What's so special about this game anyway? It's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and Shelbyville. They built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. They made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game.	Oooh, the walls are melting again.
Why do you mock me, oh Lord?	Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic...
I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious.	Homer, that's not God, that's just a waffle that Bart tossed up there.
Huh?	Homer!
Y- No.	Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you.	Y- No.
Well, yeah.	Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?
Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you!	Well, yeah.
Hi.	What?
Yeah.	Wow, these are amazing seats, huh Homer?
Hey everybody, here comes fun!	Yeah.
Heh heh. Ow.	Hey everybody, here comes fun!
Well, I guess I should pay my share...	What the hell happened to my dogs? I want answers.
Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned.	Relax, Homer, I keep tellin' ya, you're my guest.
NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN.	Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned.
"If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan ""The Boy"" Taylor."	NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN.
We won! We won! Flanders, we won!	Stan, Stan, he's our boy, if he can't do it, no one ...will.
Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!	Heh-heh, yeah.
I am invincible! Invincible!	Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!
Ow!	I am invincible! Invincible!
Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!	Ow!
It was him!	Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!
You know Stan Taylor?	Hidilly ho, Stanster.
Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.	Know me? Ned Flanders saved me. I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models, until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more.
"Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called ""Stitch-face."" Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."	Sure. Anything for Neddie. Here you go.
No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!	Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again.
Marge, quit livin' in the past.	Homer, that's our wedding photo.
I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.	Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl.
Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese.	Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table.
Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.	Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese.
Boring. Let's watch something else.	That's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?
Yeah.	Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch.
Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.	Yeah.
Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family.	Good night, Daddy. Good night, Uncle Homer.
Hey everyone!	Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family.
Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex.	Honey, I'm so glad you're home--
Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?	...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house.
Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya.	Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work.
But... all right.	Oh, you poor, unfortunate man. Let's get you out of those clothes immediately. And we'll do whatever we can about the smell.
C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?	But... all right.
Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays.	Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight.
Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that.	...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women.
Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.	Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too.
Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love.	That was you!
The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.	Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly...
Yes way.	No way, José !
Don't worry, I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape. It always makes the trip go faster.	That's the spirit.
Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot.	WELL\WELL\WELL...W-W-W-WELL\WELL\WELL...
More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go!	WELL\WELL\WELL\ W-W-W-\WELL\ WELL\WELL\WELL\WELL\WELL
Okay, let's go boating!	More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go!
They're fine.	How are my boys doin', Homer?
I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons.	Lies made baby Jesus cry.
So, here's to my best friend, Ned.	I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons.
Food fight!	Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--
Whatcha doin'?	Yeah!
Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!	We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Too late.	Oh, I don't know...
Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh?	Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship.
Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?	Oh! Almost. Boy that was close.
Right, no reporters.	Ah, uh, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. Family only. You know?
O-okay.	No, I-I mean just the Flanders family.
Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt.	But you said.
Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!	Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt.
Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.	I can't, it's a Geo!
Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats.	I think we should leave.
I live to give.	"Before I get started on today's sermon entitled , ""What Ned Did,"" I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work."
Right back atcha, buddy.	Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend.
Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt?	Right back atcha, buddy.
Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there.	Yeah. Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
Get lost, Flanders.	Hi-diddly ho, neighbor.
See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about. This place isn't...	Okilly-dokilly.
Hi, Mom.	Hi, Mom.
I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today.	Eeeeeee!!
Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get.	Think you'll win?
Push her down, son.	Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
I call the basement.	I think you'll find that escape is impossible. Now each one of you take a floor and get started.
All done.	Amen, Ernie.
Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories.	You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.
"""Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter."" Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!"	Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories.
Shazam.	Shazam!
What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?	Stop remembering TV and get back to work.
Use only in a well ventilated area.	Wah-wah.
Shove it, buddy.	Use only in a well ventilated area.
Nothing.	Homer, what's going on down there?
Okay.	Then stop screaming so loud.
Y'ello?	"Well, hot dog! We have a ""wiener""!"
He's taking the elephant instead of the money.	Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant.
Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!	I want the elephant.
We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. We could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love.	Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!
Lisa, go to your room.	You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. Which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
Wee!	Hey!
Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.	Homer, it looks like it could gore.
Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory.	I really think this is a bad idea.
What's he yelling about?	I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.	You ate it too fast.
Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel.	You can't do that, Dad. It's cruel.
Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth.	Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel.
Shut up.	I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
Plants, eh?	He can't just eat peanuts, Dad. He needs plants to live.
Hey, any more arboretums around here?	Strip the bark now, Stampy.
That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!	No.
Grooming him, eh?	No, Dad. He's grooming him.
I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.	Ew, Homer, there is a bird on your head?
Hey, what's with them?	Nah. He doesn't want to learn and I don't want to teach him. We get along fine.
"Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. ""Chain for elephant,"" ""Shots for elephant""... ""Oversized decorative poncho""."	I think they're trying to get some attention.
Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.	Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.	You'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
For the ninth time, no!	We'll pay you money.
Wait a minute, this gives me an idea.	For the ninth time, no!
I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son.	Uh, here's a better sign, Dad.
Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks.	I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son.
Look at this, Marge! Fifty-eight dollars! And all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world!	Smithers, this reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.	Stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. Right?	Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.
Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me.	Yes. But we paid you four dollars.
This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.	Get off our property.
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.	No, Dad, he's my friend!
What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?	Well sir, I'll be honest with you. I need a large African elephant. And I need it today. But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm lookin' for.
He likes peanuts.	Well it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me.	It's perfect, Dad.
So, your bid is zero.	Well we really can't offer you any money. We're a non-profit organization.
Thank you.	Well, we like to think of it as --
Thank you.	You know I really think --
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.	Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant.	Dad, you can't do this. Stampy is my friend.
Done.	I'll take that one, too.
Here's the keys.	All right, I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
I'll just keep these then.	Elephants don't have keys.
He took Bart too?	I'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!	He took Bart too?
Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.	That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!
Stupid tornado. look. It got Patty and Selma.	Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to...	A female deer.
Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.	Ow. Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
I'd like it fine.	Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene...	Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Huh?	Dad! You're sinking!
Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.	Get a rope, Bart!
Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...	Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.	Ow!
Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.	Dad!
On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products.	Thanks, Dad.
All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.	On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products.
Mmm. Caramel.	Ow! My hair!
Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.	Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson. Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life or have been mistreated. But, like people, some of them are just jerks. Stop that, Mr. Simpson.
Woo hoo! What do I get?	Congratulations Homer Simpson! You've just won the employee raffle!
Woo hoo!	The job of industrial chimney sweep for a day!
Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder.	Woo hoo!
That's it, boy. You're our last hope.	So much for Plan B.
Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in.	I've gotta stop fantasizing about Lee Majors. Ah, one more.
Oooh. He card reads good.	Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick.
It's KURNS, stupid!	So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns.
Disregard.	No it's not.
The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.	Excellent.
There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great.	I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.	Just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.
Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything...	Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet.
Boo!	Well, I --
Oh, yeah. So good...	I'm okay.
Yeah, let's push him down the steps.	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?	All right.
Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.	Homer, say something.
That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!	Oh yuck, meatloaf! My most hated of all loafs.
Bart, you listen.	No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. I'm suffocating here.
My secret shame.	Oh, go eat some flowers.
Bart, you're coming home.	Ugh! Smithers get it off me.
Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.	I suggest you leave immediately.
He locked the door! I'll show him.	Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.
You idiot! He was the most talented one!	"That was a heartbreaker. But I did get Paul McCartney out of ""Wings."""
Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?	Homer, that's Hans Moleman.
Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!	Let me try one.
I'll miss you, son.	Hurry! Fire him now or I'll disown you. You'll lose everything. The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video, the freedom to do whatever you want.
Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us.	Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!
Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.	How do you know?
Right back atcha, son. Aw.	I love you guys.
And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman.	Right back atcha, son. Aw.
Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh.	Cowabunga, dudes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?	Yeah, I guess it is guilt.
Well, I'm off to work.	Well, yeah, but --
But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.	The dog has had enough excitement.
Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere.	But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.
"How many ""s""'s in ""innocent""?"	...with your new principal, Ned Flanders!
Yes, deeply concerned.	Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run.
That is true.	Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
I can't let the boy see me skipping work.	Can't let Dad see me playing hooky.
How do you do, sir?	Good afternoon.
Sucker.	How do you do, sir?
Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.	Oh, I see. If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school. Well, if Freddy Quimby didn't do it, I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury.
I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.	I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say.
All right.	Give those glasses to the bailiff.
Okay, fine.	Will the jury retire and come to its decision?
What does sequestered mean?	We might as well make it official.
What does deadlocked mean?	If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world.
"Uh-huh. And ""if""?"	It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
"So ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the Springfield Palace Hotel."	"A conjunction meaning ""in the event that"" or ""on condition that."""
"Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, ""Free Willy!"""	Let's vote. My liver is failing.
Uh, how are the rest of you voting?	Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote.
I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.	Uh, how are the rest of you voting?
Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can.	I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
Room service? Send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.	Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can.
Shut up.	"You know, we're kind of like the original ""Odd Couple."" You're the messy one and I'm..."
Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!	Hey, I'm tryin' to eat lunch here!
I don't like this new director's cut.	Ew, What a mess.
Got it, Barn?	I don't like this new director's cut.
I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.	You're stealing a table?
Souvenir.	Ah. Is that my necktie you're wearing?
Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch.	Make that four months detention.
Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it.	Good for you, Homie. You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone.
Pfft. What do babies know?	Maggie, can you point to the monkey?
What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.	Homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday cake.
Ooh.	Hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! I made a special cake for you to ruin. It's over there.
Or, if not then, Christmas.	It's been great spending time with my family again. I guess the next time I see you won't be until Thanksgiving.
Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny.	Homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely.
Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.	"Yeah. Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. ""Periodicals,"" that's it."
Oh.	Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?!
Not at all.	Pardon me, sir. Forgive my clumsiness.
Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!	Well, I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother.
If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!	Bart! Homer, what possible reason could you have against Grampa being in love?
Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool.	Hot diggity! I'm gonna smooch her like a mule eatin' an apple! I even bought me some special novelty dentures.
NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS.	Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool.
NOW WHAT'S THAT RULE?	Oh, I see. SO IF I TAKE YOUR ADVICE / AND MAKE YOUR PATENTED MOVE / THEN MY CHANCES FOR LOVE / WILL SLIGHTLY IMPROVE?
All right!	Whoop-de-doo, employees! Everyone who's found true love may leave early today!
Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him.	Mom's almost ready for her date. She sure seems taken by this new beau. I feel so bad for Grampa.
Yabba-dabba-doo!	Why it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife, Wilma! Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates.
That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys.	He's an awful, awful, awful man, but I guess if he makes Mom happy, that's all that really matters.
What?!	Dad, I'm really sorry, but I charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card.
"Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of ""Nightline""!"	Don't worry, here's the cash.
Woo hoo!	But Dad...
Ew yuuuuck!	Evil-schmevil, Marge. Monty can provide for me, and besides, he's a great kisser.
"Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called ""chips."""	Homer, do you want any cards? Homer?
Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.	Do you want another card or not?
I mean, woo hoo!	Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
I was bluffing.	I'm in. Let's see your cards.
How dare you call me that?!	Hey, don't yell at Homer. Just because he's a little slow...
"So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... get this... ""A little slow."""	Get the hell outta here.
How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?	"So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... get this... ""A little slow."""
You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!	We don't think you're slow. But, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything.
Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow...	You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!
Take another bath in malt liquor?	Oh Homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better.
"Oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?"	... There's that. Or, you could take an adult education course.
And how.	That's because you were drunk!
Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him.	Gettin' better!
That's it! If he can teach a class, he can teach a class. I mean, I can teach a class.	Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him.
"Well... I can tell the difference between butter and ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."""	What is your area of expertise?
I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?	No you can't, Mr. Simpson. No one can.
That depends. Is there another way to get this job?	Oh, you're married?
I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging and noise... Of a family of love. Sha la la la.	No, Mr. Simpson, what I mean is, we may have a job for you after all. We need someone to teach a course on how to build a successful marriage.
Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows.	I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging and noise... Of a family of love. Sha la la la.
Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.	Homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. You've ruined a perfectly good jacket.
Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher.	I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad. So, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more Socratic method of interactive class participation?
Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach.	Well, Homer, what a pleasant...
Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!	Can I take your order?
It's all right! I'm a teacher.	Sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.
All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.	I didn't know we could do that!
Down the hall, room twelve.	All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.
Ew. Okay, let's get started.	Thank you.
No talking.	Ew. Okay, let's get started.
Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how 'bout you, Otto.	Um, how about if we tell you our problems with relationships?
Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny.	Simpson!
Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange.	You were not! You were just eating a damn orange!
First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards.	Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange.
Okay. But then we've got to get to work.	I don't understand.
I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.	He's a horrible excuse for an educator.
No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money.	So something wasn't working in bed, huh?
I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.	Trouble in paradise, huh? DERISIVE LAUGH)
Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.	Marge dyes her hair?
I went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.	C'mon, tell us more!
Come on, Marge. Let me in! There's crickets out here.	That's nice.
Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.	Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class.
Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say.	Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair.
Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.	Mm-hmm. I'm happy about that. But, I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy.
Yes ma'am.	Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again.
Now what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as: 'The process of removing weeds from one's garden.'	Yes ma'am.
This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things.	Tell us more about you and Marge.
No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds.	I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course! What the heck was that lab fee for?
Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.	Oh, all right. / Okay.
"Well let's just call 'em uh, ""Mr. X"" and ""Mrs. Y."" So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'"	We need names!
Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home.	Homer, don't you have to get to class?
Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives.	What the darn...?
So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?	Apparently that disturbing odor was the food.
And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?	I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.	Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer.
Why you little...	What the hell are you talkin' about? You're the one who double dared us.
Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed...	Me too.
All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.	Get out! Get out! Get out!
Huh?	You, too.
But I'm not in the cla...	Get out!
Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives.	Is any of this gonna be on the test? 'Cause I wasn't paying attention.
But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again.	You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore.
Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.	Hey, Homer, what's the big brouhaha? Ha.
Honey, the door blew shut! Oh. Fine. That's what you want? You got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road. Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world.	Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.
Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies.	Affirmative, humanoid.
Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains.	Sorry, Bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. I only like it when I'm pretend scared.
Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him.	Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains.
Why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture.	Good night, Marge.
I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...	Funny... the way everything reminds me of Homer.
Together?	I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...
Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.	Here, Dad. I brought you some nice...
Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr.	Dad, that's just a plant.
OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod. All right, let's get our stories straight. She tripped, right?	Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr.
Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back.	Look, I brought you some nice pudding.
I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.	Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. There's a reason two people come together and stay together. There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you want to get Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.
Okay, thirty.	No.
All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.	Good luck, Dad.
Moe, what are you doing here?	Homer!
Bye, Moe!	I didn't ask her for no water. She's lying, Homer, she's lyin'. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I... I didn't do nothin'!
Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can.	Homer, what happened to you?
A bouquet of po...	Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can.
I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.	A bouquet of po...
My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.	I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence.	Oh, here, let me help you.
Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you.	Homer, that's not a good thing.
Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again.	But, how do I know I can trust you?
Wait until my class hears about this. Kidding!	I must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed.
It's great to be indoors with my family.	Wait until my class hears about this. Kidding!
Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.	"Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an ""F""."
Special present?! I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. Oh. Right. Later.	And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight.
Hey, Moe!	So Marge, are you really happy, really?
It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator.	Homer, my hat goes off to you.
I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.	Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. Although I must say, it's certainly refreshing.
Marge, can you set the oven to cold?	Won't this overload the motor?
Yes, Lisa?	Dad...
I understand. Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.	CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? Canwe... etc.
Ooh, The Tinkler. I like the sound of that. We'll take it.	"Over here we have ""The Hick Tub,"" ""The uh Insta-Rust,"" that's ""The Lightning Magnet,"" that's ""The Tinkler..."""
All right, everybody in the pool!	Look, question lady, this job is not what I really do, okay? I play keyboards.
Woo hoo!	Yes, Dad.
Don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer.	I'm gonna miss the whole summer.
Ah...There's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool.	Well, it looks like it's just you and me, Barty Boy.
Lisa! The Blob has got me! Don't touch me, or he'll get you too!	YAAARR--Ewwwwwww!!
Chlorine, eh?	Dad... You have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean.
Mmmm....	This was a lovely idea, Homie. Come here and kiss me.
But why? She's such a fox. I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt.	Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife.
Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.	Oh, well I guess that explains everything.
Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.	Um, I'm right here.
Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Now easy... easy.	I can keep this up all day.
Hm, I'm gonna need a bigger drill.	Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Now easy... easy.
You're steerin' fine, boy... Hard to the right!	Hurry up and finish eating!
Hard to the left!	Oh!
Cat!... Deer!... Old Man!	Whoa!
Don't worry, buddy. Here's a quarter. Call for help at the nearest phone... I'll keep an eye on things here.	Jackknifed sugar truck. Sugar?
We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener.	Homer, that was downright decent of you.
"Read your town charter, boy. ""If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot."" Since I don't see him around, start shoveling."	Dad, isn't this stealing?
That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound.	It hurts my teeth.
Those are prizes. Ooo, a blasting cap!	And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
Sugar Man!!	You're thinking of bears, Mom.
And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.	Note: Next year order fewer cards.
Woo hoo! A four day weekend!	"While you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday."
Must... protect... sugar... Thieves everywhere... The strong must protect the sweet... the sweet	Oh! Got away from you, huh? Well you keep at it.
In America, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women.	Homer?
Huh, wha?	Homer, Homer!
Oh am I, Am I really?	I want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. You're being completely paranoid.
A-ha!	Oh am I, Am I really?
All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?	Hello.
"Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called ""City Fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson."	Homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?
No!	Look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?
Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!	No!
Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!	Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!
Bees are on the what, now?	Ah, very clever, Simpson. Luring our bees to your sugar pile and then selling them back to us at an inflated price.
Deal!	Simpson, you diobolical... we're willing to pay you two thousand dollars for the swarm.
Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!	Oh, wait a minute. The bees are leaving.
It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii.	I'm sorry, Homie.
Like what?	What?
Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?	Wake up!
Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!	Wake up!
There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?	It's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddy pool.
Hmmm.	Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.
Hm...	No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something.	Hm...
Oh, okay.	No, think about people. About moments in your life that have been very romantic.
Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off.	Happy Valentine's.
Ooh, that was a close one, kids.	Okay, Homer.
Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own.	Ooh, that was a close one, kids.
Hi.	Yeah, ditto.
Gotta go.	Ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
I made it the whole day without seeing her again.	Gotta go.
I mean hello!	I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.	I guess we'll be goin' down together. I mean getting off togeth-- I mean...
That's unsexy.	That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.
Ew.	That's unsexy.
Well, this is my floor.	Ew.
See you tomorrow....	Well, this is my floor.
I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together...	See you tomorrow....
Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.	"TV's there	 bathroom's there	 and there's your king sized bed for..."
Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.	Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
Oh!	No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service!
Go to hell!	No more Chernobyls!
I was doing my best to resist her...	Go to hell!
But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom.	I was doing my best to resist her...
Yeah, yeah.	This was a really nice night, Homer.
Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.	What's wrong?
Yes we do. The cookie told me so.	Oh... well, we don't have to.
But they're so sweet.	Well, desserts aren't always right.
Oh, baby.	Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want.
She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.	Yes, what did happen to her?
Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right...	Well, kids, I tried. Maybe you're right.
Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!	Yeah, right.
All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!	Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
Marge?	Homer.
Sure.	Yeah, you want a ride?
Who? Oh.	You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with.
Marge, pour vous.	My prom date.
I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.	Why so glum?
But not the last.	Ah, your first kiss.
Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy.	Dad! Remember how you said that going to Itchy and Scratchy Land would be too damned expensive?
No no no no no no no no no. Ask your mother.	Yayyyyyy!
TV Town! Hammock Land!	"Yeah. ""Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."""
Embarrassed? What are you talking about?	Now wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time.
Oh yes.	Well, there was our trip to the Amish Country...
Hey, look Marge! They're still not fightin' back! I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! Hee hee hee hee!	Oh yes.
Suckers.	Even worse was our trip to Sandy Beach.
Shark-boy!	Suckers.
Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed.	Don't worry, Mom. We'll make you proud of us.
Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families.	Which one of you is the mailman?
Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!	Agreed.
No.	Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?
Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?	No.
The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge.	What's the matter with you, Homer? We don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car.
Now, to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio.	Hey, Mr. Wimbly, it happened again.
No.	Haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
Don't mind if I do.	No.
We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all.	We'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
"""North."" ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut."	Whew. I'm glad that wasn't us.
Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such.	Homer, no. You're going to get lost.
All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again.	Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such.
Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot.	All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again.
One adult and four children.	Possibly go wrong. Uh, that's the first thing that's ever gone wrong.
What's that?	Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?
Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see...	Do it, Dad.
I'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.	Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see...
Eyeball stew.	Bart!
Oh look! It's the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.	Tortureland, Explosion Land, Searing Gas Pain Land, Unnecessary Surgery Land...
Parents Island?	Ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals.
It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!	Kids?
Thank you!	"Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved and cared about almost all the peoples of the world. And he in return was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his controversial cartoon ""Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors."""
I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.	Dad?
But Marge, I was a political prisoner.	I have nothing to say to you.
I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?	How were you a political prisoner?
Hey look, this one's coming on to me.	Oh for gosh sakes, what now?
Yoo hoo, Mr. Robot...	Hey look, this one's coming on to me.
Lisa, don't contradict your elders.	Dad, I think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend.
My hair! You chopped off my hair! Oh God I'm ugly!	Lisa, don't contradict your elders.
Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.	Oh my, it looks like we're doomed!
What're you, the narrator?	Dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits.
Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.	Hey, mouse! Say cheese. Hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.
But there are five of us.	As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner of the park, I'd like to thank you for stopping the killer robots. And to show my appreciation, here are two free passes.
That's better.	Here are two free passes.
"Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me..."	Yeah, switch the station. I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable.
When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station.	Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else?
I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.	When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station.
Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box.	That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
Phew.	Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is.
Uh-huh.	Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail.
Oh, Sideshow Bob.	When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her.
It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!	Ack! Help! I'm being attacked by uh things!
I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!	Homer, we've got to stop them.
Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.	Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics.
Hey, Mr. Smithers!	I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the campaign.
Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there.	Row. Row. Row.
John Denver.	This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials.
Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer.	Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke.
Hm, not a drop in the house. What do you know?	Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer.
I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!	Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well.
Sorry, sorry. Don't worry, there's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that axe collection. See ya later.	Homer!
Moe! Give me a beer!	So what'll it be, Homer?
Why should I kill my family?	No. Not unless you kill your family.
You don't look so happy.	Uh, they'd be much happier as ghosts.
"So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something."	This is less encouraging.
Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!	Go crazy?
Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat...	Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!
Can't murder now. Eating.	Homer, it's Moe. Ah, look, some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward.
Noooo!	C'mon.
Heeeeere's Johnny.	Noooo!
Must kill family. .	Oh my, I hope that rug was Scotchguarded.
Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover.	Dad, look!
Urge to kill fading, fading...	Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover.
Fading... Rising!	Urge to kill fading, fading...
...Fading, fading, gone.	Fading... Rising!
Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow.	...Fading, fading, gone.
Can't. Frozen.	Homer, change channel!
Urge to kill rising.	ONE / SINGULAR SENSATION...
Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy.	Urge to kill rising.
Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!!	Dad!! Daaadd!! Homer!!
This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools.	Dad, it's in there again!
There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast.	This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools.
What the-?	There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast.
Look at that! I'm the first non- Brazilian person to travel backwards through time!	What the-?
I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. OK. Don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...	Quiet, you.
Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future.	If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything, because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine.
Stupid bug. You go squish now.	Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future.
But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right?	Stupid bug. You go squish now.
Oh, my loving family. Nothing's changed.	Phew. I'm back.
Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?	Okilly dokilly.
What the hell are you smiling at?	Just relax, let the hooks do their work.
Nooooo!	It's Bliiiiisssss.
Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea.	Nooooo!
These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.	Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea.
I gotta go back... Fix future...	These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.
This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.	I gotta go back... Fix future...
Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it!	This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.
Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish.	Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it!
Hey, where is everybody?	Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish.
This is gonna cost me.	Okay.
I mean, Heeeyy.	This is gonna cost me.
Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?	Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?
Don't touch anything?!! I'll... touch... whatever... I... feel like!!	This is indeed a disturbing universe.
What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!!	Good morning, dear.
Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.	Homer! The sky is blue. Donuts are plentiful. Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you?
Eh. Close enough.	Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.
Uh oh, it's seeping in! Stupid cheap weather stripping.	Huh?
I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!	There's only one thing to do at a moment like this... strut.
No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today.	Oh that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?
New glasses?	Have you noticed any change in Bart?
Probably misses his old glasses.	No. He looks like something might be disturbing him.
Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.	I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.
It was, Marge. Admit it.	That's not what I meant.
Oh good, here comes the collection plate.	Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug.
We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed.	Thirty cents off Shake 'n Bake. Homer!
Stop him! He's headed for the window!	He confessed!
Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need.	Stop him! He's headed for the window!
Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!	I didn't take it.
Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?	Homer, stop that. I believe him.
Ooo, how convenient.	That's what he wore to church.
See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad.	No.
To the little girl's room!	If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money.
I like those odds.	Kent, I'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me at the Springfield Laugh 'n Brew 'n Burgers 'n Fries this Saturday. The forecast calls for a seventy-five percent chance of hilarity.
Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?	Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder.
Done and done.	Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates.
Ah, the mysteries of life.	That's not fair... Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting chewed out?
Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.	Cheer up. So you're not good at sports. It's a very small part of life.
I mean my little girl buddy.	Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.
I tried.	I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. How about letting her ride up front, too?
Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well.	Oh yes, we won! We won! We won! Um, unfortunately, since I bet on the other team, ah, we won't be going for pizza.
Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such.	Yeah, that's it, Milhouse! Keep up the chatter!
Oh! Ooh my - oh, the hell with it.	Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such.
Okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to make a few things clear.	No.
I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?	Please, Dad, I'll be fine.
Come here, you butterball.	I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?
We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference.	I can't even watch. I don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor Lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
Okay, little buddy, hop in!	Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net I really think you helped your team.
Okay, hon.	That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love.
Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here.	Okay, hon.
Ah, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come but, you know...	Come watch TV with me, Dad. We missed the first two episodes of Cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three.
Wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. To think of all the time I wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... I love you.	Hey Milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! Jimbo! Jimbo! Go for the face! Look! Ralph Wiggum lost his shin guard! Hack the bone! Hack the bone!
Quiet down, Bart!	Mr. Honeybunny!
Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this.	Hm, I better go check that out. Now Homer, don't you eat this pie.
And if you get eaten, it's your own fault.	Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this.
Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.	I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.	Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
Pass the ketchup.	Hey! That's Obsession for Men!
I asked for ketchup. I'm eating salad here.	You'll have to do better than that tonight, chump.
Moe, what are you doin' here?	Hello.
Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best.	Stop it! Stop it! Conserve your precious hatred for the game.
Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?	No.
Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!	No.
Hi kids!	Hi Mom! Over here! Mom!
I love Bart!	OH SAY CAN YOU SEE... ... LIGHT, WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HEL... I shouldn't have turned down those cue cards .
No, wait! I love Lisa!	I love Bart!
Beer. Oh, Marge, I love you!	No, wait! I love Lisa!
Oh my God, Marge. A penalty shot, with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore.	For the greater good.
You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. .	Ew. Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. They go in the trash.
They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.	How did you get tickets?
Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side.	No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me!
Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you.	Oh, well thank you Homer. But take one of the kids.
They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.	Homer, are all these pockets necessary?
Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers.	Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!
I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.	Mr. Goodbar to the front desk... The front desk is looking for Mr. Goodbar.
Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc.	I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
I don't know.	As you can see, I have created a lemonball so sour it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. The candy, known as 77X42 -- Where the hell is the candy?
Mmm hmm. Keep going.	One, a humorous substitute for your own lips.
Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.	Ah, you're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am.
What dat?	Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.
Must have rare gummy. Distract the salesman Marge!	"Will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
Now, this is going to take all my skill.	Oooh... how'd they get there?
Run, Marge! Save the booty!	Halt! Halt!
See you in hell, candy boys.	Run, Marge! Save the booty!
"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's my gummy de Milo? Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far	 she has no arms."	Wheee!
Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.	I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the baby-sitter home now. She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
See, she's having the time of her life.	Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.
So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?	See, she's having the time of her life.
Nobody's blaming you. Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once.	I'm sorry?
Precious Venus...	Just drop me off here.
For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...	There he is! There's the man that sexually harassed me!
"Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."	"Two four six eight / Homer's crime was very great! ""Great"" meaning ""large or immense"" / We used it in the pejorative sense!"
Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.	You grabbed me in the car!
C'mon, I'm a decent guy...	Boo!
Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?	Dad, I don't understand. What is she saying you did?
That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman.	Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.
Well, that's kind of a gray area.	And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?
Thanks, kids.	We know you're innocent, Dad.
Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!	Homer! Wake up! Wake up!
It's okay, they're with me.	You people aren't allowed in here.
They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go.	Boo!
Uh-huh?	Homer--
You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!	I already talked to the Indignation Coordinator out on the lawn today. I told her you were a decent man. But she wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more I can do.
Y'ello?	You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!
Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it.	We're aware of your problems and Mr. Simpson, we want to help.
...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is...	Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it.
Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style.	That was really great, Mr. Simpson, we got everything we need.
Hee hee. Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!	Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style.
Awww, crap!	But first... she was a university honor student who devoted her life to kids, until the night a grossly overweight pervert named Homer Simpson gave her a crash course in depravity. Babysitter and the Beast.
"... Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so I grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! Oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! I just wish I had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"	Awww, crap!
Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea.	Dramatization. May not have happened.
UNDER THE SEA / UNDER THE SEA / THERE'LL BE NO ACCUSATIONS / JUST FRIENDLY CRUSTACEANS / UNDER THE SEA.	Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea.
Not with that attitude.	Homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. It's not gonna happen.
It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows over for me.	Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.
Hey, that's a half truth.	Simpson scandal update: Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent which he believes gives him sexual powers!
Whaa?	Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good.
"Ooh, ""Portrait!"" Sounds classy... doesn't it?"	"And now, we return to Fox Night at the Movies. ""Homer S.: Portrait of An Ass Grabber,"" starring Dennis Franz."
I don't have a friend in the world.	Now this technology is new to me, but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. He's literally stewing in his own juices. Now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. Unless Proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will.
Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.	C'mon on let us through, you vultures.
I need a hug.	Ten five G's!
How come you guys hesitated?	I need a hug.
Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.	It's just hard not to listen to TV. It's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
Are you hugging the TV?	Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
"I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - ""Evening at the Improv."" They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."	Ai yi yi! Es Homer Simpson. Me ha molestado. Ohh!
Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now.	See I think about weird stuff. Like what would happen if E.T. and Mr. T. had a baby? Well, you'd get Mr. E.T. wouldn't ya? And you know I think he'd sound a little something like this: I pity the fool who doesn't phone home.
But those shows all look so crummy.	"The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. All they care about is entertainment. Well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- Public Access Television."
"Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""Father Goose."" You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, ""We'll see about that."" So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I..."	Now it's time for the Innocence Report with Homer Simpson.
Oh, gotta go. Innocent!	"Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""Father Goose."" You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them.

Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Hmm... needs more ice-cream.	Hello?... No, Janis doesn't live here. Hello? Yes I am interested in long distance savings. Very interested.
Precious Venus...	Ah, here we go.
Thank you!	Precious Venus...
You're both right.	Hmm. Homer, I thought you were an animal, but your daughter said you were a decent man. I guess she was right.
Huh?	You're both right.
And Ted Koppel is a robot.	Wow. V8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.
Oh, that man is sick!	Tomorrow on Rock Bottom. He's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it. He's Rowdy Roddy Peeper.
But listen to the music. He's evil!	Groundskeeper Willie saved you, Homer.
Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.	Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
Let's never fight again.	Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.
Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late-night TV?	Whhoooooaa!!
No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise.	Is there something wrong, Homie?
Enchiladas.	No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise.
Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.	We need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Ooooookay.	I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help... How 'bout a book?
Oh. All right.	A tasteful book.
Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu!	Oh. All right.
Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...	Oh, I'm just reading up on, artillery.
"Oooh. ""Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."""	This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.
N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word.	I will!
Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.	HomeIE, I can't quite...
Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.	The Arabian Nights Room looks nice...
"Oh, here we are. The ""Utility Room."""	The uh... toilet is overflowing in the uh Caveman Room!
No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room.	This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room.
Never mind. You wouldn't understand.	Welcome home, Son. I broke two lamps and lost all your mail. What's wrong with your wife?
No.	Flu?
No.	Protein deficiency?
No.	Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis?
Kids-here's-fifty-dollars-Why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-Aunts'-house-Stay-there-Phone-call-you-later-Now-Now-Now.	Drink it!
Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.	Oh, Homey, what's--
You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution?	Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one! That tonic really works! You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together.
Yeah... Where are my pants?	You could make a lot of money.
Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!	You just be ready with that garbage bag.
Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!	Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!
"Ow. I guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug."	Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!
Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.	Hurry up! We got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid...
That is correct.	Now, sir, you have never seen me before. Is that correct?
They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.	You're the worst shill I ever seen! You're a disgrace to the medicine show business!
Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?	Hey, wait a minute. That's Amos Pierson's Moose Farm. Make a right, here.
Wow. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.	Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?
Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.	Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead.
Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me.	Who are you to complain? You lock me up in a home and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas!
You're the screw-up!	That's 'cause you're a screw-up.
All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!	Why you little...!
Out.	I'm sorry I said that.
Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me!	Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?
I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child.	You didn't want to have Bart.
But when I do it, it's cute.	You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.
Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve.	... are forcing our parents to go to bed early in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of DINNER! We're through the looking glass here, people!
Dad!	Aw, nuts.
"Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"	It just ain't the same without Homer. He knew how to drive a car.
You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president.	Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike.
I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.	Dad!
Wheeee! Wheeee!!!	No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me.
B-But I'm using my whole ass.	No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.	Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary.
Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?	That's what I assumed.
Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.	Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.	Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.
I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.	Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.
You know what?	No, I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.
We're both screw-ups.	What?
So are you gonna say something nice now?	It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.
Aw, Dad.	Okay, here it goes... I'm not sorry I had you, Son. And I was always proud that you weren't a short man.
I'm with you, Dad.	Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?
This is gonna to be great.	Oh I need some coffee before I black out. Homer, pass me the sugar.
Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me.	Yeah!
It's Raining Men?	And I'm pulling your favorite song out of the juke box.
Jokes on them. I'm still alive.	Oww. Ohh...
Can't.	Cheer up, Homer.
I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.	What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend more nights at home with us. Huh?
Yes. Cris-a-tunity. You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?	Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?
Thank you!	Right here, Dad.
Wow, classy.	Thank you!
Okay.	Good evening, sir. Would you please leave without a fuss right now?
Hmmm. This looks like a nice, friendly place.	Okay.
Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. Enjoy your death trap, ladies.	I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth yet.
Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!	"""Homer?"" Who is Homer? My name is Guy Incognito."
Here, Puff! Here Puff!	Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!
The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking.	Here, Puff! Here Puff!
Shut up, liver.	The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking.
Ooh, my liver hurts.	Shut up, liver.
I'd like a beer, please.	Ooh, my liver hurts.
Uh, but I am a pilot.	Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here.
I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.	Where's your uniform?
But I -	You.
Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here.	Hey, you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you?
But, I keep tellin' ya, I'm not a pilot.	You fly boys. You crack me up.
Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.	Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your co-pilot.
And um, ah, I'll just uh get us started...	Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.
Woo hoo!	If word gets out about this, Kwazy Klown Airlines will be a laughing stock. In exchange for your silence, I'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United States. Excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The freak states.
Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want.	Woo hoo!
But Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state.	I don't know, Homer. We're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season.
Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?	I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.
So Marge, pretty sweet, eh?	Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?
Marge, what's wrong? Are you Hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?	See, Dad. I told you Mom would have problems.
Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?	Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer. I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane. I'm asking you nicely to open the doors.
It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us.	Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!
Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.	Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
Not everybody.	Well, everybody's got a fear of something.
Where? Where?	Sock puppets.
Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again.	Sure as sugar.
You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave.	"No, no honey, it's all right. Really. I'm fine. I'm all right. Mother always said ""don't complain. Be good. Behave, behave. Be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."""
Marge, it's three A.M. Shouldn't you be baking?	You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave.
And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.	Mm, no, I don't need therapy, I'm fine. And it's too expensive.
It's Raining Men!	"Thank you for calling ""Radio Psychic."" Do you have a song request?"
"Now Marge, ""Dear Abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""Hero."" ""Fearless."" ""Alive."""	It's Raining Men!
She's fine.	Dad, Mom's getting worse. You have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. Look how tense she is.
Oh.	She's fine.
Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?	Oh.
All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans.	Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?
Well keep it up, then.	Dad, I like picking beans with grandma.
Good, you do that.	Okay, I will.
You'll be picking many a bean.	Fine.
Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.	Huh, this has nothing to do with you, Simpson. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother.
All right. How much do you charge?	Okay.
Keep sliding.	If money's a problem, I charge on a sliding scale. I can go as low as thirty dollars an hour.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?	Thirty dollars will be fine.
Oh, no, I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials.	Well...
"You see?! You see?! ""I"" just left ""my"" first session and ""I"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."	But it's a few seconds before 12:00.
Tell me the truth! Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't. Happy family, happy family.	I don't think so.
Oh, being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have.	Ready for breakfast, Doctor Smith?
Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!	Warning. Warning. Doctor Smith refuses to do his astro chores.
That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.	You know, Marge. We've really just begun to scratch the surface. There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this.	Lowenstein.
Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.	Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this.
That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.	Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.
That's just a carp swimming around your ankles.	That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.
What should we do until you get back?	Hm, emergency call. Gotta go.
Aw, it didn't work.	Put a pan down there.
Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.	Aw, it didn't work.
All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list.	Shh-- shut up.
Hey, will you guys help me fix my...	All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list.
Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?	Hey, will you guys help me fix my...
Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?	Shut up.
Like what?	Yeah, we got uh, things to do.
Shut up.	It's a secret.
I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.	Shut up.
So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy.	I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go.	A conspiracy, eh? You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?
Well, something did.	Oh, Homer. Don't start stalking people again. It's so illegal. Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?
Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl.	I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
All I have to do is follow the yellow drip road.	Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl.
Hee hee hee! I can see everything. And they're none the wiser, hee hee hee.	Sounds good!
I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. And I want in.	Ged oudda heah!
Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?	Oh well. That was a real nice secret organization we had once.
Next.	There are only two ways to gain membership. Be the son of a Stonecutter...
So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?	Forget it, Homer. While it has been established that eggs contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human bloodstream.
You'd better run, egg!	You got it all wrong, Homer. It's not like that.
Why don't people like me, Marge?	You'd better run, egg!
Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?	Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person.
It is. It's been happening to me all my life.	I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.
What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.	I'm a member.
Not as such, no.	You don't know what they do there, do you?
Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge.	Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?
Huh?	I'm a member.
What?	What?
This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.	I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist... I'm the president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason... Ah, here it is. The Stonecutters.
I'll take this Communist one too.	This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.
Comin' through! Can't throw me out! My father's a member! I'm in, I'm in!	I'll take this Communist one too.
Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?	Okay, okay, Homer. You're in. Just don't point that thing at me!
"Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""Hello, my name is Number One."" And so forth."	As soon as Number One gets here.
You outrank Mr. Burns here?	We call each other by number, not by name. Carl is number 14, I'm number 12. Burnsie is number 29.
Is he the leader?	Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder.
Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story.	Of this chapter. There are chapters all over the world. And it has been foretold that someday a Chosen One will...
I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.	Happy landings.
"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?"	"And this we call ""The Unblinking Eye."""
And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.	And now the final ordeal: the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles.
Oh really?	Well to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part for ya, so uh, it's still gonna be a couple of weeks.
Really?	Yes.
But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?	Yes, yes.
Heh heh heh! So long, suckers!	Well, I didn't realize you were a member.
Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door.	Same old space, huh, Dad?
Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.	Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door.
Jealous?	Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.
You're jealous.	Well... no. We've got the same chair.
What's this?	Your membership pack.
Everything lasts forever.	You put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets. And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet while they're working on you.
That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...	I still don't believe all the founding fathers were Stonecutters.
You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.	We just created the greatest democracy on earth, you low-life commoner.
Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined.	"Homer, a man who called himself ""You Know Who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" You certainly are popular now that you're a Stonecutter."
WHO RIGS EVERY OSCAR NIGHT? /	WHO ROBS CAVE FISH OF THEIR SIGHT? /
Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren.	Thank you. Tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th Anniversary. And in honor of this momentous occasion, we're having ribs.
The Black Panthers?	Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren.
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Lenny.	Homer!
What? Did I miss something?	/ This is just appalling and outrageous.
I've learned my lesson!	Please don't kick me out! This society is everything to me! Please give me another chance! I've learned my lesson.
Oh. Sorry.	/ That's it!
Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.	The mark!
Woo-hoo!	You are the Chosen One, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. Now to the top of Mount Springfield for the coronation! Remove the stone of shame!
Peek-a-boo!	Wow. Mental note. Don't overdo this.
I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.	Peek-a-boo!
So?	Remember, Dad. All glory is fleeting.
No.	Beware the Ides of March.
Remove the girl.	Don't you see? Getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
Woo hoo!	Another strike for the Chosen One! Hurrah!
Woo hoo!	Absolutely.
I'm out.	Woo hoo!
Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo.	No, no, Homer. You have a... royal... sampler.
You know, I think you guys are lettin' me win.	"""Good one, Chosen One."" Etc."
From now on, I want you to be honest with me. I mean, I'm not perfect, right?	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading.	Yay!
What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated.	You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War .	Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.	Dad, that doesn't help people.
Brothers, brothers.	Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate.	Aw, Homie. You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club.
You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.	Oh, thank you Mr. Simpson. It looks so much better. A beautiful sky-blue.
Hey, fellas. Can I join?	Silence! I now call to order the first meeting of the Ancient Mystic Society of NoHomers.
Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.	Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites.
You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to.	I meant our wedding rings.
This club'd better be worth it.	You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to.
Go Knightboat, go!	Incorrect. Look. A canal.
Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.	Or a fjord.
But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat.	Okay, TV off. It's family time.
It was Bart.	Homer!
So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat.	Why don't we all look at the photo album?
Thanks honey. Bank shot.	Aw.
And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.	Thanks honey. Bank shot.
Moom.	Yeah, yeah, yeah two. Let's get to the baby pictures.
That's exciting.	Moom.
Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story.	Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.	Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy.
"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."	Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
I was at my work station when suddenly...	"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
Not on my shift.	Attention American workers. Your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of free-lance terrorists.
Oh no you don't!	Not on my shift.
Simpson ten, terrorists eight.	Oh no you don't!
Okay.	Homer! Tell the story right.
Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt.	Your paychecks, gentlemen.
Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job.	Good aim, Dad.
Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.	But Homer, how're you gonna make a living?
Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya.	Hey, what did we do?
Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want.	Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya.
Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!	Is that so?
Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!	Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!
Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!	Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.	He's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.
And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise.	That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
And now the final phase of my plan.	And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise.
Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?	And now the final phase of my plan.
Woo hoo!	Sure.
Why?	Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags. Oh, and a change of pants.
Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices.	I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
And only one of you kids can go to college.	From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind...
That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...	Fine.
Marge...	That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
I've got sand in my underpants.	Homer...
I love you, Marge.	Me too. Let's go home.
Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.	I love you too, Homie.
It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school.	Did you have to be so graphic?
Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed.	So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?
Hi Maggie.	Daaad!
So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant.	Hi Maggie.
The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.	Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair.
Mmm... bowling fresh.	The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
Mmm... urinal fresh.	Mmm... bowling fresh.
No.	"Homer, did you polish your head in the ""Shine-O Ball-O?"""
...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down.	Okay then.
I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well.	...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down.
I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!	Hey, great job, Homer. / Thanks a lot./ You're the best.
Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is.	Homie, I--
Well, it was my major.	"Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're ""showering"" Marge with gifts."
So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done.	Well, it was my major.
Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.	There. Aaronson and Zowkowski are the two biggest gossips in town. In an hour everyone will know.
Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.	Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer.
It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money.	Oh Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy. Congratulations, sir.
This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley.	Hey Homer, way to get Marge pregnant. Heh, heh, heh.
Man. It's windy as hell out there.	Oh really.
Hmmm. With little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. Well... I'll be in the tub.	Man. It's windy as hell out there.
New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!	By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer.
Oh just that one time.	Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?
You're pregnant?!	Actually, when I was about to have Bart...
You're pregnant again?!	And then when I told him about Lisa...
Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, where're you going?	You're pregnant again?!
You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!	Ooh, I don't have that.
Yeah.	Homer! Let your father tell the story.
Anyhoo...	Okay, but I know funny.
We're doomed!	Anyhoo...
Check.	Homer, you had a head.
Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say...	You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?
Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise.	Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say...
How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?	When he's done in there, I gotta go.
Of course!	Well yeah, but how--
Bowling! Bowling here! Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!	Of course!
My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done.	Oh.
This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey.	Anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing.
Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day.	See ya 'round, Mr. Homer.
Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back.	Yes, are you a new applicant?
Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.	So, come crawling back, eh?
Thanks for giving me my old job back.	Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.	"""Don't forget, you're here forever."""
Hi honey, how are you?	I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.
I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.	Well, actually -
It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge.	My contractions started an hour ago.
It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth.	Argh -- you're truly the catch of the day!
Marvelous.	One more push should do it.
Okay.	Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You have a beautiful, healthy baby.
Hello. Aw. It's a boy... And what a boy.	Homie, I think someone is saying hello.
A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!	Uh, that's the umbilical cord. It's a girl.
Come on Marge, show a little enthusiasm.	A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!
Absolutely.	So, you loved her right from the start.
Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up.	Then why no pictures?
...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.	NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Yeah, except I forgot to go to work.	Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad.
Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?	Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of...
There's that word again.	No, Dad, I don't think...
Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo...	Homer, what if this doesn't work?
I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...	Dad, the plan!
So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...	Dad!
All right!	Daaad, they're firing the rocket!
It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.	We're doomed!
Just a second.	Turn it off.
What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.	Just a second.
Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.	Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right.
Homer Simpson takes care of his family.	We have a bomb shelter?
Flanders! Open up!	Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.	Hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?
No deal. Out.	I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families.
An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?	One more hour.
THERE it is.	An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.	All right!
Uh, yeah. I can do that.	And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer.
Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders.	Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy...
I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry.	Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders.
No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there.	Say Moe, was it a duck?
And it was a baby ox.	No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there.
I know kids, I'm scared too.	Yeah, dad was right.
I am holding still. I am squirming.	So I'll just make some more money. Crank out some cheesy merchandise.
It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!	I'll found the college tomorrow.
"""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard."	Finders keepers.
"""Best in the West."" It rhymes."	"""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard."
Clown college? You can't eat that.	"""Best in the West."" It rhymes."
Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever.	Clown college? You can't eat that.
Clowns are funny.	Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire.
Marge.	I think I'll have some wine.
That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!	Yes, Homie?
Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.	I don't think any of us expected him to say that.
You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.	Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty!
Homer.	New Hampshire.
Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life.	Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy!
Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...	Okay, memorize these funny place names. Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga, Seattle...
Steady, steady...	"And now everybody's favorite, the ""spin cycle fantastique"" trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool."
Kill wealthy dowager.	Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? Wrong.
Got it! No shock for me .	This is the happiest day of my life. A-YAH-ha.
Lord save me.	To- Audience -I - now - proclaim - this - new - burger... for sale.
Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you!	It's the Krusty Burglar!
Hey, hey.	Please look at my Medic Alert bracelet.
And - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and Ah. Here's your giraffe, little girl.	Hey, hey.
That's the spirit. Never give up.	I'm a boy.
I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards.	Hey, nice threads.
Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something.	Boy, you're really running yourself ragged.
"And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""Starsky and Hutches."""	Well my time's almost up here, so uh, I'd just like to say I know Woody Allen.
Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo.	Let's walk and talk. I ah, I have some wonderful stories about other famous people that include me in some way.
Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick.	Hey! Me too! We can go together.
Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.	Your churlish attitude reminds me of the time I was having dinner with Groucho, and...
Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business.	Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.
Oh no.	Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business.
I'm not Krusty.	"Well, well, well ""Velocity Boy,"" I am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... Hey! Krusty!"
I am not Krusty.	Oh, to think I was going to give you a ticket! Krusty the Klown!
Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development.	Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty.
You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?	Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development.
I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint.	"How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy magazines kept me in business during that first shaky year? By the way, here is your new issue of ""Gigantic Asses."""
Look at it.	I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint.
Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?	I'm not saying it won't work. I'm just saying it's dishonest.
I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!	Right, Boss.
I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty.	Cancel the world search.
Hey, what are these holes?	Well, I can't give you the car, Krusty... but I can let you have this little number for practically nothing. Only thirty-eight thousand.
Oh yeah. Speed holes.	These are speed holes. They make the car go faster.
Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.	Whatcha diddily doin', neighbor?
What keeps doin' that?	Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside.
Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.	The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club?
Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi.	The same Barney Gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister?
Benedict Arnold!	The same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate Committee about organized crime?
Krusty the clown.	I am so glad I had a chance to meet you before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great-a fan. Don Vittorio Dimaggio.
But, I've never been able to do the...	I cannot do it. To murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. Tell you what, Krusty. Do for me my favorite trick where you ride the little bike through the loop, and I will let you live.
How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?	But, I've never been able to do the...
Okay.	How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
I'll never be able to do this trick... never.	Okay.
Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!	Go! Go!
Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!	Payroll. Burt Stanton speaking.
Heh-heh, good one, Krusty.	I am confused.
Ta-Da!	Without the loop, it is nothing.
Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?	Are we in any dange--
No, I'm gonna ask Marge.	Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?
Psh, that's no reason to block the TV.	Hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... I'm being indicted for fraud in Australia.
"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned..."	Yes'm.
Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?	And Bart's childish taunting agitated the Aussies further.
That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man.	Well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign of good faith to our Australian friends, we'd like to imprison Bart for five years.
All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?	You're sure now, the prison train is sailing... Okay, I'm not hearing a lot of support for prison. There is one other option. They'll drop the charges if... Bart makes a public apology in Australia.
Oh, yeah, this is the life. Boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida?	No, sir. U.S. Marine Corps, sir.
SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY... OF THEE I SING.	No. To combat homesickness, we've installed a device that makes them swirl the correct, American way.
Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!	Actually, sir, the embassy is considered American soil, sir.
Australia! America! Austr--	Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!
--alia! America, Australia, Ameri-- ow!	Homer, that's enough.
Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about.	All right, all right, you win. I see you've played knife-y spoony before.
No. It's pretty big, I guess.	Something wrong, yank?
Punishment?!	Well, you're free to go, Bart. Right after your additional punishment.
Booting?	Well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh? Let the booting begin!
What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!	Yuh-oh.
You sold us out, Conover!	Mr. Simpson, shhsh! Disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. It's one of their proudest traditions.
Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!	You sold us out, Conover!
When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!	Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!
Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!	Ewww. It's not like in cartoons.
Maaarge!	Liiiiisa!
Show 'em what American butts are made of, son!	Thank you, Bart. I promise I won't make fun of you later for this.
Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?	All right, mates! Let 'em have it!
Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops.	No, sir. The closest vessel is the U.S.S. Walter Mondale. It's a laundry ship. They'll take you the rest of the way.
Take a guess.	Yeah, Homer. What's your secret investment?
Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in.	Uh, pumpkins?
All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one.	Homer, you knucklebeak, I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before Halloween. Before!
How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.	All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one.
My house is on fire! Woo hoo! Insurance to the rescue.	How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.
Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick.	Hello, Homer.
All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.	Yeah, Homer, let your wife have a glimpse of success, for once.
Wrong!	I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man.
Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow.	I wish you wouldn't put Homer down like that. He may not be a big success like you, but I can always count on him to provide for the family.
Hello Vegas? Give me 100 bucks on red. All right, I'll send you a check.	Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow.
If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...	Hello Vegas? Give me 100 bucks on red. All right, I'll send you a check.
Uh, could I just get a look at that?	Every person in America now owns one of these, and in many cases three or four.
But uh, could I just...	Why would you need to see it? You're the genius who invented... the product in question.
Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!	Now don't worry. You'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.
No, my invention! All my money problems could've...	Homer, wake up. There's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime.
Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not.	Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?
And Lisa, my little princess.	Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not.
And who could forget dear Rat boy?	And Lisa, my little princess.
Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?	Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance.
Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments.	Well you should have gotten here earlier.
That was in the third grade.	I understand that, Mr. Simpson. But according to our computer, your credit history is not good. It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. It also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner.
Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight.	Yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. I'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house.
Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.	Well we'll look for the house with no numbers.
All right, you'll get your money.	Well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.
You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money.	All right, you'll get your money.
What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.	Cut him a check and get him the hell out of here.
Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.	You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad.
Mmmm, slanty.	Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.
Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.	Now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!
It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.	It means...
All right, you had your fun. Now get lost.	This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn.
Hunh?	Oh, our fun hasn't begun yet.
No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.	You are?
Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again.	Let's go, Homer. On the way home, we're all stopping at Moe's for a Zima.
Request permission to slink by.	Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?
But you're already smoking cig...	Permission pending. First, light our cigarettes.
You're really pushing it.	But you're already smoking cig...
I'll have to trust you on that.	"C'mon, Homer. You can't spell obsequious without ""IOU."""
No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!	Well, Marge was always a good speller. Let's ask her.
But... Yes, ma'am.	Ah-ah-ah-ah! Just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.
Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge.	What's going on in here?
What paper?	What's that paper?
I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings.	Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters?
You told!	He blew all your savings on jack-o-lanterns.
Sorry Marge.	You told!
I never want to see you again! You either!	Sorry Marge.
I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight.	Homer, Homer why didn't you tell me?
Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.	Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table.
In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar.	But I like to make you breakfast.
What was that -- national anthem?	Hey Dad, whatcha doing?
Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.	What was that -- national anthem?
Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine.	Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.
I'll never pay off that debt.	Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine.
That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.	Need money fast? Got no experience? Step up to elegance. Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
No. Well anyway, turn it off.	I didn't turn it on. I thought you turned it on.
"Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, ""Young Frankenstein"". ...Scared the Hell out of me."	"This reminds me of the movie ""Fame"" and to a lesser extent the TV series, which was also called ""Fame."""
Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face.	Uhm, thanks.
Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?	Homer, it's not that easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and I...
Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!	Evening Simpson... You got a short in your taillight. It started blinkin' when you made that turn. Let's see your chauffeur's license.
Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert.	Why did she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?
Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm.	"""Tested,"" Homer, God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
Look, all I ask is that you be fair.	Well, well, well. Look who needs us again to get his chauffeur's license.
You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?	Failed to check blind spot, minus two points.
Nagging the driver, minus ten points for you.	Ooh, seat belt twisted, minus one point.
Being a jerk, minus a million points.	Grazed a cone, minus five points.
Well, I...	So Homer, how'd you do?
I'll never forgive myself for this.	uh... she uh...
Yes. I am in flavor country.	Wait a minute, those are yours, sir?
It's a big country.	Both of them?
Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides.	Homer, I'm -- I'm speechless. You just saved our hides.
I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you.	That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
Call off the debt?	If there's anything we can do to make it up...
Call off the debt?	Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test.
Debt's off! Let's go, Marge. Woo hoo!	Uh... well...
Marge, are we Jewish?	CAN'T TOUCH THIS!
Woo hoo!	No, Homer.
Mmmmm.	Woo hoo!
But what can I do? I'm just... one man.	This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.
Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled.	"Hello, I'm Bart Simpson. In the past, I've brought you such classic films as ""Homer in the Shower,"" and ""Homer on the Toilet."" And now, I give you... ""The Eternal Struggle."""
My ears are burning.	I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance...
No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip.	Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad.
Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?	"""You can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."""
Oh, you're right.	It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours.
There ya... Just second...	Oh, you're right.
Oh, that should...	There ya... Just second...
It was a gummy bear.	Oh, nice to meet you, Marge. I saw your hair from the plane. And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil.
Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic.	Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
But, I'm still hungry.	Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop.
Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work.	Thank you!
Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter!	How droll.
Whatcha doing, Marge?	Muh... muh... muh...
Marge, do you respect my intelligence?	Making out the jury list for the film festival. Mayor Quimby -- Krusty -- Jay --
Okay! Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes?	Yes.
Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?	No reason.
Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?	Yes.
It's just you and me now, lock of hair...	That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by.
Yeah, well you think I'm stupid.	You don't have to do this.
Prove it.	I don't think you're stupid.
Put me on that film jury festival thing.	Prove it.
Exactly. Heh, heh.	Next.
Pull my finger.	Oh boy, this is gonna get worse before it gets better.
This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars!	"Hans Moleman Productions presents ""Man Getting Hit By Football."""
But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again.	"This isn't ""America's Funniest Home Videos."""
What'd I miss?	I think we have a winner.
Football in the groin. Football in the groin.	Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you.
Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute.	Why don't we all take a five minute break? It'll clear our heads.
I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.	How did you know my name?
Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me.	How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that?
Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.	Well, Homer.
Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin.	Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.
Wow. I'll never drink another beer.	Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.
I'll take ten.	Beer here!
Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket.	Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury.
Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts.	Your name tag.
Can I have some?	Yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.
Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon.	Mine ears are open only to the pleas of those who speak ye old English.
I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.	Whatever.
Woo hoo! Oh, Marge, that's great news!	...except for the international market it's my...
Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!	Hey, hey there with the personal calls Simpson.
Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news.	I think I'll write your performance evaluation now, Simpson.
Maggie! I need to use the phone!	Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news.
Will that girl ever shut up? Okay, Marge. I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Wait, why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks.	Maggie! I need to use the phone!
Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock.	Homer, don't take this personally, but I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding.
Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?	Oh Lisa!
Whew! Uh, enjoy.	Now throw compost on it!
You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box.	Oh, still warm.
Oh, right.	Homer! Bart! Maggie! Company eating rules.
So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger.	Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school.
I said, pull my finger.	Yes, we have that one in England too, Mr. Simpson.
Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.	Maggie! Don't talk with your mouth full.
Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.	Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh Hugh?	Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.
Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.	That's true.
Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again.	You know, Fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice.
Keep it down in there!	Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again.
Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya.	Well, here goes nothing. Mom, Dad, meet Homer Simpson.
"You know what's great about you English? ""Octopussy."" Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."	Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya.
Ooh la la.	I can't feel anything below my cummerbund.
You look great, sweetheart.	Hi, Dad.
Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.	Thanks.
No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter, and I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--	She's quite a hellion, but she does have an incredible voice.
See? You're still helping me.	Dad, you're babbling.
Aw, no...	Hey, Dad. Did you forget to give those cufflinks to Hugh?
I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.	Well?
Lisa, Lisa! Where were you!? You missed the most incredible thing!	Oh, you'll have a true love. But I specialize in foretelling the relationships where you get jerked around.
I ate seven pounds of fudge!	Hi, Dad.
The man at the stand said it was a record!	Wow!
I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!	Wow. What else did you do, Dad?
Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?	Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
Did they?!	Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?
Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'.	Did they?!
"My ""Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak"" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"	My strobe light!
Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!	Yes, the dog...
Well, problem solved.	Please?
You got it.	Homer, hold on to the wheel!
Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'.	Hey!
Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know.	Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!
Two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? Gimme the ticket.	Oh, this place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for them, Homie? Homie?
We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on.	Two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? Gimme the ticket.
You're lucky you got looks, Marge.	And they're off! She's The Fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead!
Yes! Come on, you little horse!	As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed by Always Comes In Second and I'm Number Three...
Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex.	Aww...
Now it's two sets of twins.	Look, it's twins!
Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family.	Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?
Get that cat out of the way!	Look at Branford II! Isn't that cute? He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc.
Ooh... this time... Ah...	Well, it's just easier this way.
Do you have a better idea?	Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?
How do you explain the culottes, boy?	Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisa's to school today!
Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.	Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?
Mainly your mother.	Nooooooo!
Splendid. Who's coming?	All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight.
Who wouldn't?	...and I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets...
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?	She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust.
A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies.	My, he certainly took that well.
Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds.	You don't have the guts to take us all on.
Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.	Check mate.
Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.	But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive.
Well, it's always in the last place you look.	Relax? I can't relax. Nor can I yield, relent, or... Only two synonyms? Oh my God! I'm losing my perspicacity!
I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.	I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat.
I'm with you, Marge. Lisa, get in here! In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics.	That's it. We have to get them back to school.
So, how was everybody's day at school?	Ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there.	Exhausting. It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada on the map.
Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady.	There's no way I'll get into an Ivy League school now. At this rate I probably won't even get into Vassar.
Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!	Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again. They're like two positively charged ions.
Why you little...	No thanks to you, Homer.
Really? Wow.	Um, the guy who chopped up George Washington?
"Kids are so naïve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."	Mom, I think he's serious.
Now get to school, boy.	"Kids are so naïve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog.	Don't worry, son, you'll be fine. This boy's appendix is inflamed and about to burst, which will make it easier to find once I get in there .
Woo hoo!	Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!
Oh, right.	Now Homer, please. The boy has just had a very serious operation.
Woo hoo!	Your sax! Thank you so much!
Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?	I'm sorry. He passed away.
Oh I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy.	Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.
Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over.	Thank you. Oh Dad, why did he have to die?
Remember, honey?	Uh huh.
What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman.	Yeah.
I blew it again.	Oh, Dad!
Mmmmmm.	I blew it again.
Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love.	Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and Bleeding Gums was a good friend to you. But nobody is really gone as long as we remember them.
Starland Vocal Band?! They suck!	Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love.
And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.	You didn't know him! Nobody knew him! But he was a great man! And I won't rest until all of Springfield knows the name of Bleeding Gums Murphy!
Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.	Hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him.
OK, then this. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo	That's Mary Had a Little Lamb.
They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?	Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave.	Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers.
We're outta here!	Devilishishly satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that?
Whoa, careful now. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone.	We're outta here!
Woo hoo! Easy money!	Three Card Monte.
Then how come that guy's winning?	Homie, these games are fixed.
No Marge!!	He's getting away!! C'mon! C'mon!
Marge, are you okay?	We'll try to make it twelve.
Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman.	Ah, I think I'm okay. It was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating.
Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here.	Oh for crying out loud...
You did what?!!	Welcome aboard.
Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.	I borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?
Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.	You got it, little buddy.
Aw, thanks, honey.	Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house.
Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me.	Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before.
Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border.	Homer, give me my pepper spray.
Mmm. Incapacitating.	Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border.
Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun.	Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad.
. Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though.	Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... Oh my Lord!! Something horrible has happened!
But you thought they were.	Oh.
That's why it was so funny. But they're not.	Yeah.
"""The Girls of the Internet."" Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day."	Hey, great news, guys. I picked up a nudie deck for our game.
"Are you kidding? Being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries	 we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid	 and I can run background checks on whomever I want Mohammar--"	Hey, Homer, you sure it's okay to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble here now that your uh, wife's a cop?
Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour.	Homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may.
All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --	C'mon, put that away. Those radar guns give you cancer.
Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies.	We'll be goin'... / We'll just be goin'... / We don't want no trouble, officer...
Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.	I didn't mean to.
You're cooking what for dinner?	I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system.
Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?	Homer!
That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too.	Homer, I'm on duty.
I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there.	You have to move your car.
I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.	I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now.
C'mon, we're family.	Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket.
I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!	You're breaking the law.
What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc.	Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.
Whuh! Marge, not here. Hey, you're not really arresting me...?	What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc.
I choose to waive that right.	You have the right to remain silent...
Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.	All right, Simpson, you're free to go.
"I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""I Love Lucy"" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side."	I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer. But what I did was right. Someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there.
All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage.	Yeah, yeah, Barney's right. / Yeah. / Let's get some more beer. / Hey what about some beer? / Yeah, Barney's right!
Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.	I'll, I'll-I'll get it, Homer.
Well, what do you call it?	"""Garage?"" Hey fellas - ""the garage"". Ooo la de da, Mr. Frenchman."
Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.	And what better place to make the buy than in a cop's garage where no one would suspect a thing.
Okay.	Not so fast.
"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""	Maybe you should just stop entirely.
Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this.	No, it's Officer Simpson - of the police!
It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen.	Homer!
Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you.	Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!	So long, gotta catch the 501.
Marge, how did you know...	That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago.
No, what I was wondering is...	That the pants would rip?...
Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.	That's some nice work, Simpson. But um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence.
What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.	Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?
Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!	Death to Shelbyville!
Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech...	We just got word there's Springfield kids in town!
Yes, there is. Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!	Isn't there anything we can do?
Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!	Well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the...
Found 'em!	Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out.
You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this.	Found 'em!
I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!	But they stole our lemon tree!
That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!	Package for parcel processing. Pronto.
Stupider like a fox!	Bust in here and take it? You must be stupider than you look.
I'm okay.	Stupider like a fox!
This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.	Hu-hu-hu-hu. Don't you get it, Springfield? It's over. You lose. Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.
Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down.	There's got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there.
No one in history has ever done anything this clever.	AND I THINK TO MYSELF, WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD...
That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.	I'll get the gate.
Faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!	That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.
Sorry.	It won't start! Something's draining the battery?!
Woo-hoo!	We made it!
Here's your package, Mr. Burns!	Precisely.
--son!	My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! Smithers, who is this nincompoop?
I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?	Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?
What? What's your idea?	I have an idea.
That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?	When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. After that, she never forgot him.
Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card.	Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?
Kids, would you step outside for a second?	"""Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie."" Dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
F-F-F-F-F-F-	Kids, would you step outside for a second?
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!	Who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / Puddinghead? / Mooncalf? / Limpnoodle? / Goldbricker? Drizzlepuss? / Cueball? / Fumblefist? / Galoot?
What?	Look out!
Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!	Who the devil are you?!
Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!	What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of...
He can't remember my name!	He robbed the school of Tito!
Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?	Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And Dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.
Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers.	Could not!
My tool shed! Oh Dad!	We don't have an outhouse.
Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!	Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns' sun blockin' machine. You wanna come with?
Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name...	Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.
Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson!	Who the devil are you?
Me! Me! Me, me!	Who wants chocolate ice cream?
I swear, I've never seen that gun before.	Hey-ho. Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.
Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit.	Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
So you finally learned my name, eh?	Homer Simpson?
I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.	Homer Simpson.
Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.	Ho-mer Simp... son. Ho... mersimp... son.
Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.	Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?
Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?	Bart, why are you talking like that?
Which one were you? The ugly one?	Yeah.
Were you the ugly one?	Which one were you? The ugly one?
Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here.	You're right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God.
Careful now.	We'll run that cable through here.
"Hey, didn't you direct ""Unnatural Discretion""?"	Careful now.
Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!	Heh, yes I did.
You guys work on the movie?	Eh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together.
Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?	You saying we're not working?
Marge, there's a spider near my car keys.	Enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself.
Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear.	Shoo! Get outta here!
Oh, never you mind...	"""Good for a three hour getaway at the Mingled Waters Health Spa."" Mineral bath, facial, massage... How did you afford these?"
What advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? Which I could also afford.	Oh, never you mind...
No we shan't. Yoink!	...gently massages your buttocks. Well, Count Homer, shall we discuss the--
Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.	Homie, this is so sweet. But I can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess...
I got my dad to look after her.	What about Maggie?
C'mon, Honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.	Don't do that!
Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel.	This is so relaxing. Homie, this was a wonderful idea.
I love gettin' away from this dump.	Those parents better have a good excuse.
We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!	Parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.	Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.
Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant.	I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me.
Lousy houseplant!	Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant.
I can see Lisa... but it might be a starfish. I've gotta call 'em!	Can you see them?
Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!	No, I don't care for children.
Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.	And Margaret?
Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie.	It's Maggie!
Communication. Gotcha.	I can see you sincerely want your children back. But you have a lot to learn about being parents. Before I can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called Family Skills. It teaches parents to listen to their...
Listen. Yes, I know.	But it's important to...
I have listening skills!	But there's more to it than...
Shut up, Judge!	Mr. Simpson, would you please --
Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.	This is so humiliating.
What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.	It's so quiet here without the kids.
I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.	"I miss the way Bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
That's it.	You mean Maggie?
Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that.	There's Bart's ring!
Why you cotton pickin' --	Paw, I cut myself on the screen door again.
I love you, Cletus!	I love you, Paw!
Kids, we're good parents now! Get your asses out here!	Looks like I'm gonna have to baptize you myself.
Oh no! In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseseses!	He's going to baptize our children?
Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!	Where we going? Where we going?
The Springfield River!	Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!
Son of a bitch...	Oh, why do you hate my trains?
Noooooooo!	Do you reject Satan, and all his empty promises?
Oh, Bartholemew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.	Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me. How do you feel?
I said shut your ugly face, Flanders.	Wait, Homer. What did you just say?
Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.	Oh, fair enough.
Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!	So, what was it like at the Flanders' house?
Old painty-can Ned!	There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though.
I'm not ashamed.	Yeah. Family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?
How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?	So come on. I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking.
I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!	Nah. I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time.
Forty seconds? But I want it now.	I got it used from the Navy. You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?	Nothing.
Hi, is Milhouse home?	Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?
Mmm. Sounds good.	COME TO UNCLE MOE'S FOR FAMILY FUN / IT'S GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!	Hiya, folks! Welcome to Uncle Moe's! Aw, look at all the cute little minors.
And he knows my name.	Right this way, Homer.
Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe-Balls!	I can't take this anymore. I want my soul and I want it now!
Run, boy! Run!	Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe-Balls!
Run for your life!... ... Boy!	Run, boy! Run!
Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?	Yeah. Yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better.
Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?	Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?
What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?	Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?
Let me get a pad....	What?
No.	Are we there yet?
No.	Are we there yet?
No.	Are we there yet?
That's the plan.	Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.	What a load of crappy-crap-crap.
It was good, but not great.	That's it, Honey. Get into the spirit.
Out of the way, you.	AWWWW.
Aww.	Out of the way, you.
Hey Flanders!	Attention, families. This is Mother Goose. The following cars have been broken into...
Shut up.	Hidilly ho, neighboreeno!
So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?	Shut up.
Sure.	Can I come?
This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge.	Sure.
You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever.	Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.
Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb.	I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?	No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!
Ham?	No.
Pork chops?	NO!
Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal.	Dad... those all come from the same animal.
Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's.	Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that.
That's a typo.	What's that extra b for?
"But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, ""Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?"" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad."	Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat?
Wow, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg.	Hey, Homer. Thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.
I've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection.	Ahh. Diagnosis: delicious.
One whopper for the copper.	Hey Homer, wing me another one of them burgers, would ya? I can't quite seem to stand up under my own power anymore.
Here ya go!	Can I have a burger, dad?
Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for! The pig de résistance!	It's bad enough they're all eating meat. They don't have to rub it in my face.
Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?	Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast.
It's just a little dirty -- It's still good! It's still good!	Sorry, force of habit. Lisa, no!
It's just a little slimy! It's still good! It's still good!	It's just a little dirty -- It's still good! It's still good!
It's just a little airborne! It's still good! It's still good!	It's just a little slimy! It's still good! It's still good!
I know.	It's gone.
Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!	Give it up, dad. Piggy ain't comin' back.
That's it! Go to your room!	I'm never ever apologizing because I was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room.
Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?	That's it! Go to your room!
Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.	You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?
Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.	Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.
Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.	Homer, you're not not talking to me. And secondly, I heard what you said.
Bart, go to your room!	Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to.
I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all.	Why don't you just eat him, Dad.
That's it. Go to your room.	That's it. I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. I am out of here.
Lisa! Lisa!	I'm Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Man... I hope I will enjoy my show...
Lisa! Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am!	Lisa! Lisa!
I dunno. Were you looking for me?	Hi, Dad. Looking for me?
Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?	While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney.
I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid.	I still stand by my beliefs, but I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue.
C'mon, I'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, I mean a veggie-back ride home.	I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid.
"There it is! The chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat Southern sheriffs!"""	Ah, the Miracle Mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. It truly is a miracle.
I want a colossal donut. Just like the one on the sign.	"There it is! The chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat Southern sheriffs!"""
Nuts!	I want a colossal donut. Just like the one on the sign.
That's false advertising! Lard Lad lied!	Nuts!
I paid for a colossal donut, and I'm gonna get a colossal donut.	Sorry, sir. No refunds.
Eggheads. What do they know?	Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok have just reported an ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the Van Allen Belt. Scientists are recommending that all necessary precautions be taken.
Hee hee hee. I've got your donut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it?	Eggheads. What do they know?
Get what?	Homer! Where did you get that?
Well... I acquired it legally, you can be sure of that.	That giant donut.
Hello? Yes? Oh! Uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... Flanders has it. Just smash open his house.	I agree. Destroy the school.
He came to life. Good for him.	Hello? Yes? Oh! Uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... Flanders has it. Just smash open his house.
I told you: Flanders has it. Or Moe! Go kill Moe.	Help me! Help me, Lord!
Well... okay. If it'll end horror.	Homer! Just give him the donut. Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.
Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?	Well... okay. If it'll end horror.
Mmmm.... sprinkles.	Well, except for Chubsy-Ubsy over there.
We'll be right back.	Even as I speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading toward your town. Lock your doors. Bar your windows. Because the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat your family.
Take out the garbage.	Yes.
Lousy Smarch weather.	It all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. We were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
"""Do not touch Willie."" Good advice."	Lousy Smarch weather.
Oh, no. Better ride this one out in the closet.	Homer? Get ready. Patty and Selma will be here any minute.
Oh yeah? Well it's my house, so it's my spot.	Sorry, dad. This is our spot.
Did not.	Nuh-uh, 'cause we called it.
You are?	Well, we're calling it now.
They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.	'Fraid so.
That's weird. It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.	Do you see a light, Homer?
I'll take my chances in the mystery wall.	You're gonna help us clean and organize 'em. And pry out all the dead hermit crabs. Get a screwdriver.
Hello? Can anybody hear me?	Hey! You can just suck 'em out!
I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.	Homer? Where are you?
Just a second... No, it's a place I've never been before.	Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again.
Hey!	Ah, the shower!
I don't want to alarm you, Marge...	Hey!
But I seem to be trapped in here.	I don't want to alarm you, Marge...
What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...	We better call Ned. He has a ladder.
My stomach sticks way out in front and my...	What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...
Hey, shut up!	Hunh. It's like he just disappeared into fat air.
Mmm... Unprocessed fish sticks.	Hey, shut up!
Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it.	Mmm... Unprocessed fish sticks.
Ow! Watch it, coney.	Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it.
Oops.	Ow! Watch it, coney.
Yes.	Oops.
Ow!	Move into the light, my son.
"Um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""Tron""?"	Homer, this is your physician, Dr. Julius Hibbert. Can you tell us what it's like in there?
Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?	"This forms a three-dimensional object known as a ""cube"" or a ""Frinkahedron"", in honor of its discoverer ."
Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy.	Take that, you lousy dimension!
Help! I don't have much time!	No, Pops, it's too risky. For all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large...
I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...	Cool, man!
Piece of cake, son!	Oh, I can't get any closer! You'll have to jump!
Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!	Piece of cake, son!
Craaaaaaaaaap!	Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic.
Omigod...	Eww. This is the worst place yet.
Ooh, erotic cakes!	Omigod...
Someone's in here.	Hmm... That one!
Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo!	Someone's in here.
Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait.	Yeah. Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. Especially my big fat mouth.
TWO!	Raise your right hock. Aerate! Raise your left hock. Aerate! I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts!
Arrgh!	"Actually, Homer, that's just one. See, each push-up includes both an ""up"" part and a ""down"" part."
Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?	Arrgh!
Stupidity, eh?	Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay. Pfft. It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity.
Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Must hurt self.	Stupidity, eh?
Hello.	Yes?
Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?	May I help you?
Thank you.	Okay.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy!	Thank you.
"Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy!
Yes I can.	You can do it, old boy!
Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!	If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?
I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body.	I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us.	Have you told mom about this?
Yes, sweetheart?	Da-ad!
Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy.	Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.
Can you recommend a doctor who will?	My God, that's monstrous... I've never heard of anything so neglige-- I'll have no part of it.
Of course.	Now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology.
What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?	You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic.
Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'!	Bye-bye, everybody!
I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?	Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work.
Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!	I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?
Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...	Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack.
Any time I want.	Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break?
Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races?	Any time I want.
Hello, honey.	Neat!
I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability.	Hi. Ah, er, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week?
So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow.	Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance?
Beautiful. G'night.	Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--
I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.	Beautiful. G'night.
I need a miracle.	Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.
Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut...	I need a miracle.
Well, that's a plus.	"Dad? It says ""Non-Toxic."""
Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!	Well, that's a plus.
Oh my.	Ah, Dad? Towel rack...?
Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting.	Oh my.
Thank you for your pity.	... Yes, Simpson.
I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.	Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season...
Well, I use a computer!	Work, huh? Let me guess: Computer programmer? Computer magazine columnist? Something with computers.
I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.	What's the connection? Must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. Well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. So we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes...
I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.	Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute! Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets! Due to a fire at the Army Testing Lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the Expressway! Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable!
Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers.	I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.

Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.	Aw no, the corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke.
Well, why don't you live in it then?	I like school.
Yes, honey?	Dad?
You dragged me all the way from work for that?	Homer, we need to have a serious talk.
I...	Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?
Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant.	Con: You're endangering your health.
Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work.	Con: You're setting a bad example for the children.
Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?	Con: You're running the air conditioner non-stop. It's freezing in here.
Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here.	Con: I am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?	Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here.
"""Sound alertness horn?"" Y-E-S."	"""Vent radioactive gas?..."" Y-E-S."
"""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a--"	"""Sound alertness horn?"" Y-E-S."
"Hey, all I have to type is ""Y."""	"""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a--"
Hey, Miss Doesn't-Find-Me-Attractive Sexually-Anymore. I just tripled my productivity.	"Hey, all I have to type is ""Y."""
Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y.	Good. Good for you.
Y, Y... What the heck are you doing over there?	Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y.
There. There. You found the floor.	Y, Y... What the heck are you doing over there?
YYY... Y... Y... Y...	There. There. You found the floor.
Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--	I'm going out. I run errands during the day.
"Oooo! ""An Urgent Plea From Edward James Olmos!"" ""Lisa Simpson: Can you afford to miss another issue of The Utne Reader?"" Kids."	The mail! The mail is here!
Free sample of fabric softener? Woo hoo!	"Oooo! ""An Urgent Plea From Edward James Olmos!"" ""Lisa Simpson: Can you afford to miss another issue of The Utne Reader?"" Kids."
Hmmm, I can feel three kinds of softness.	Free sample of fabric softener? Woo hoo!
Washing my fat guy hat, honey.	Dad, what are you doing down there?
Hey, what are you kids looking at?	Hey, leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man and he has real feelings.
Don't make me close the shade!	Hey, look. He's trying to get up to yell at us.
Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies.	Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside.
I got someone to cover for me.	Shouldn't you be working?
"One for ""Honk,"" please."	I got someone to cover for me.
What are you talking about?	I'm terribly sorry, sir. But I'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs.
I could sit in the aisle.	Well, what I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats.
"Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see ""Honk If You're Horny"" in peace."	"Hey, Fatty! I got a movie for ya -- ""A Fridge Too Far."""
Oh, that's raspberry.	Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac.
I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird?	This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! The overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. And they're gonna make their voices heard! All they need is a leader!
Marge?... Lisa?... Flanders?...	I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird?
Explosion imminent?!	Marge?... Lisa?... Flanders?...
Omigod, the plant's gonna explode!	Explosion imminent?!
"Wait, I know! ""Vent Gas."""	Who cares? It's Homer's problem.
Pressure too high?	"Wait, I know! ""Vent Gas."""
"""Tank must be shut down manually?!"" Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why you..."	Pressure too high?
Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault.	"""Tank must be shut down manually?!"" Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why you..."
Shut up!	Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault.
I gotta call the plant and warn them!	Shut up!
Get away, dammit! Run for your lives!	Ten hi-ya-ya! And nine hi-ya-ya..!
Let go! I gotta get to the tank!	What can I get for thirty cents?
Wait a minute! There's probably a --	... One hi-ya-ya!
Thank you, Mr. Burns. It was pretty scary up there. But... For a while I feared for my life.	We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.
Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again?	Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.
Woo hoo!	Bah! I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.
Hey everybody! Up here!	Hey, where's Homer? How'd he get out of this?
Right away, Mr. Smithers! I'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --	Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!
Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it.	That dummy worked like a charm, Dad.
Sixty-one... Sixty-two... Sixty-three...	Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it.
That's m'name.	Homer?
Listen here. My name is Homer J. Simpson. You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. Now I want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo.	Whuth va hell ith going on heah?!
I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file, anyway? I have a right to read it.	Okay, Mr. Simpson, I'll just make the change here ...and you're all set.
"""Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa..."" Aha! See, this thing is all screwed up. Who the heck is ""Margaret"" Simpson?"	You sure do.
"""Youngest daughter..."" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."	"This is so weird. It's like something out of Dickens or ""Melrose Place."""
You see that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave. My Dad points it out every time we drive by.	"""Youngest daughter..."" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."
Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person.	Mr. Simpson, maybe you should actually go up there.
"""Here lies... Walt Whitman""?!!"	Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person.
"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""	"""Here lies... Walt Whitman""?!!"
Why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!	"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""
I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?	You awful, awful man. Get out of my son's grave.
I thought you were dead.	Homer?
Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.	Oh, Homer, you grew up so handsome.
Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?	Oh, my poor baby. You must have been so upset... but I suppose Abe has his reasons.
Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment.	Oh, it's a very complicated story. Let's just enjoy this moment.
I'm sorry.	Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment.
Hey, everybody, I've got a big surprise for you! Presenting: my mother!	That's okay, darling. It wasn't your fault.
I'll Kwaanza you!	Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars.
This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.	Homer, don't be so hard on little... What is his name?
Hey, Mom, lookit me! Look at what I can do!	Me, too!
Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.	These are the calling cards of a con artist.
But?	She's nice.
First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason.	I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.
I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.	Which was?
Then why did she leave me?	Oh, Homie. C'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. I'm sure you were a wonderful son.
I thought I dreamed that kiss.	I'll miss you, Homer.
Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?	Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground. Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook. And I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership.
Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp.	But I did. I sent you a care package every week.
Any undelivered mail for Homer J. Simpson?	But I did! I really did! I'll prove it to you.
Hey!	No. Oh, wait. This.
Seven!	HOW MANY ROADS MUST A MAN WALK DOWN / BEFORE YOU CAN CALL HIM A MAN?
Rhetorical, eh? Eight.	No, Dad, it's a rhetorical question.
"Do I know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"	"Dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
You could live with Grampa again.	Gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield?
Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?	You know, Lisa, it might be nice to rest for a while.
It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. But who are you, and why did you tip us off?	We made it, Homer!
Thanks.	well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid of the asthma that was keeping me out of the Academy.
Yak yak yak yak yak.	Yeah, just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose through the ranks of the Springfield Police to become Chief Clancy Wig --
At least this time I'm awake for your goodbye.	Well, there's my ride. The underground awaits.
Don't forget me.	Oh, hurry up, man. This electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left.
That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob?	Oh, just think, Lis, that's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel.
Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?	And he tried to murder me.
Free Duff! Viva life!	Of course you can not.
They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes.	Sir! Right away, Sir!
Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?	Da-ad! Why aren't you looking?
Oo, look, it's Maggie!	Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?
Uh... Maggie?	Oo, look, it's Maggie!
Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!	Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. Thus, I submit to you: we abolish television. Permanently.
Okay, so we can't go over the fence.	Wait. If I could only stay on the air, I'd have a hundred percent of the audience. Think of the ratings.
I'm sure they're fine, honey.	I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them?
Well, I wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. Now let's roll.	Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hide-out and I got a secret message to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic blast but I'm okay now!
Jump, boy! I gotcha!	Bogie's airspeed not sufficient for intercept. Suggest we get out and walk.
Now you, boy!	I'm comin'!
Well, goodnight, son.	"And what better place to premier their creation than on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. On April 19th, 1987, America first met... the Simpsons."
Yeah.	Um, Dad...
Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.	What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?
Good night, son.	Thanks, Dad.
We may be the best parents in the world.	Sweet dreams.
Goodnight.	Goodnight, dear.
There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.	All right, climb in.
Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?	Yeow!
Somebody ate those cookies.	They're all gone. The whole batch.
I think she's trying to tell us something.	Did you eat the cookies, Maggie.
Go on, Maggie. Go. Go.	Go on Maggie.
Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!	"renamed ""Homer."""
Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what?	Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping!
Bart! Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy!	Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what?
Bart! Where are ya, boy.	Gotta hide.
Aha!	Oops.
There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it?	Aha!
Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.	"Over the six years ""The Simpsons"" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. Tonight we'll answer some of your questions. Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes, ""I think Homer gets stupider every year."" That's not a question, Professor. But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves."
I don't know.	Okay, Mr. Burns. Uh, what's your first name?
Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!	Well Homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.	Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!
Yabba dabba doo!	Well, duh.
SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE	Yabba dabba doo!
Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard.	SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE
I'll take care of this.	Careful, they're ruffled!
Ants!	I'll take care of this.
Don't mind if I do.	Go crazy?
Ooh, sorry. Here's another one.	I'll take a hit, dealer. Joker? You're supposed to take those out of the deck!
But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?	The store is-a so rich, she'll-a never notice.
No, I work at the nuclear power plant.	Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean, it was national news. Do you still work for NASA?
Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside.	Oh, Homer.
Woo hoo! Ow!	Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil.
No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'.	No, let me try the cup and ball.
Bart, you're coming home.	A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns. In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. Watch.
Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.	I suggest you leave immediately.
"Young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."	Bart!
I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight.	Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game.
Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!	Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh God, I gotta change that tape!
Hmmm. We didn't have a message when we left. How very odd.	Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!
Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?	Hello, Muddah. Hello, Faddah. Here I am, at Camp Granada...
'Tis the season, Marge! We only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!	Homer, didn't you get any milk? All I see is egg nog.
Oh, no, I'm not.	Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up.
Hey! I don't remember saying that!	Please, Bart, no more pranks. It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo.
I wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!	Okay.
Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.	What's wrong, honey?
"Hmm. Wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""Menswear?"""	Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.
"Maybe it's ""Sporting Goods""... Wait, no, ""Sleepwear""... Oh, probably ""Better Living."""	"Hmm. Wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""Menswear?"""
Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas...	Oh, Homie. Look at that watch. I've always wanted a watch like that.
Pfft. Must have been a pretty slow century.	Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas...
What are you doing to my son?!!	I thought I told you: no returns for busted merchandise.
"Stealing?! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain what's-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those ""Police Academy"" movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Where was I? Oh yeah, stay out of my booze!"	Oh, Bart.
I've figured out the boy's punishment. First: he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second: No eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months.	Goodnight.
Eh, what are you gonna do?	I always thought I understood my special little guy. But somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine.
Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!	You guys made a snowman family?
Get 'im, Ma!	You can't hide from me in this house, Bart! I spend 23 hours a day here!
"Ooo! ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions""! I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."	You fold it, you bought it.
I don't think so, stupid!	Does something smell funny in here?
No, I want roast beef, you clod!	Homie, you want pork chops?
"""The All igh-ty ollar?"" I get it."	Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.	Gee, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny, and Carl?
Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think.	Awwww.
I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.	That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. But who am I to complain?
Hey, we can be a team!	I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
Woo hoo! We won! We won!	Hey, we can be a team!
"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."	Woo hoo! We won! We won!
Uh...	You're short one person.
That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.	Uh...
Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?	Okay, then, I just need your five hundred dollar registration fee.
Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!	No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!
Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars.	It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.
Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?	For what?
Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?	Leave the rag.
Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars.	Pop 'n Fresh! You glutinous little doughboy! Oh, there's something I've wanted to do to you for years.
Hey, everybody, if you want to ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or something!	Woo hoo!
Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us.	Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that.
C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO...	Well, that's a funny-looking strike.
DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO...	THEN BACK TO MY PLACE WHERE I WILL GET YOU BLOTTO...
Lemme set the scene for you, Marge.	Those beers are five dollars apiece.
It's a 7-10 split.	All right.
The hardest shot in bowling. It was all up to me.	Uh-huh.
So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match.	Ooh.
I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess.	Who knocked down the pins?
Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me.	Good for him!
But... but...	I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split. He's phenomenal!
There it is, boys, the championship trophy!	Ahh... We forfeit.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike.	Ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants.
Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!	Bart! Where do you pick up words like that?
Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.	Homer! Watch your mouth!
Then what are you dressed like that for?	We are not wieners!
"""They made us!"" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!"	They made us!
By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer...	Way to go, Homer! We win again! Good job! Etc.
You want to join my what?	Listen here... I want to join your team.
Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no.	Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything.
Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.	Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no.
Uh, Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship game...	Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh fellas?
Aw, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now thanks to Burns it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case.	Now this I gotta see!
Marge! Someone broke the toilet!	So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!
Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that...	So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?
Awww.	I've always been wealthy , but this is the first time I ever felt rich.
You're off the team.	Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me...
Thanks.	Nice one, Homer.
Goodbye, trophy.	Next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?
I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back.	Oh. I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now, I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta!
Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.	Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware, it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building... Preview!
Marge, I'm bored.	That's right, Dick. Y'know, this year everyone's abuzz about one thing: The absence of Mark Rodkin. Oh, wait, there he is.
Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.	Why don't you read something?
Eh. I'll do it anyway.	You'd get some fresh air and exercise.
Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors.	Eh. I'll do it anyway.
Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.	Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors.
It's easier. Duh.	Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?
Uh, spray the boy.	Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?
Well, ready for the big rummage sale?	Uh, spray the boy.
Hey, I never noticed this place!	Oh, yes, indeed. I've got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishee machine.
Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?	That fancy house'll never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
The guy who doesn't live there.	Who are you talking to, Homer?
But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!	"Can we get rid of this ""Ayatollah"" T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago."
Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing.	I don't care who's consolidating their power. Well, we don't need this.
"Oh. I wanted to write ""DISCO STUD"" but I ran out of space. Not that ""Disco Stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"	"Who's ""Disco Stu?"""
Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that.	Hey, Disco Stu doesn't advertise.
Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?	Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that.
Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?	King of the neighborhood!
And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!	Right here!
Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!...	I'll take that.
Hey, big spender!...	Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!...
Spend some dough at Table Three!	We surrender!...
Table Five, Table Five...	Thank you, neighbors, thank you! Now let's give it up for Table Five! Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Five, Table Five... Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve...
Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!	Table Five, Table Five...
Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.	Wow, a former president, living right across the street!
Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?	Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--	Actually this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad. I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.
I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical.	You didn't vote for anybody.
Oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush.	Now, Todd, don't scare the president.
Oh, man, I've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those Breakfast Balls...	I'll kick you right out of the Twentieth Century, you little...
Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!	That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray.
Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!	Sir, could you pop your hood?
All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it will make you happy.	Oh... nothing.
Well, you can always depend on that.	Homie. As long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy.
He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?	Now go home and think about what you've done, young man.
First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!	And that's why your no good kids are running wild!
Hey, Bush! Get out here!	First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!
I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!	Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
You owe me an apology!	Okay is he expecting you?
Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp.	You wanna step back, sir. You're trampling the flowers.
Oh, I want trouble all right.	All right, mister. You want trouble, you're gonna get trouble.
No, you're gonna get trouble.	Then you're gonna get trouble.
Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.	Well, that's good, that's good, 'cause I want trouble.
Trouble it is.	Oh, yeah. Lots of trouble.
Yoo hoo?	Uh-unh, I'm not going outside today, not with those neighbors. Staying right here 'til my speech to the Elks Club.
It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!	Who is it?
Okay, son! Give him the glue!	Boys? Where you going?
He's not lost.	President Bush is driving on our lawn! He must be lost.
It's time to hit him where he lives.	Looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
Bingo.	His house?
So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?	Bingo.
It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!	Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.
For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!	Hey, turkeys! Behind ya!
You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!	Never! You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs!
Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?	I just drop by with present for warming of house. Instead find you grappling with local oaf.
Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike.	I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.
Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.	Pleased to meet you. I just moved in. My name is Jerry Ford.
Do I ever!	Say, Homer, do you like football?
Yes, Mr. Ford!	Do you like nachos?
Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just fi--	Well, why don't you come over and watch the game and we'll have nachos. And then some beer.
Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--	No, Grampa, don't!
Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!	Consarn it! / What's this do? / --make my adjustments here--
I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny.	Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs.
Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies.	Listen, I'm not going to lie to you: those are all superior machines. But if you like to watch your TV -- and I mean really watch it -- you want: the Carnivalé. It features: two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well, durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart...
You look great.	Alright, I will buy it. It'll be good for the economy.
Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.	Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special.
What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.	What about the symphony -- or the theater?
But Sipowicz does it.	Bart, comb your hair. Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.
I wish I was Sipowicz.	If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?
Simpson family.	Name, please?
Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in.	They're free to enjoy the club.
You should've held out longer, boy.	That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, 'til I paid him to stop.
Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers.	Yes. They're better. Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too. So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in. So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join!
That's one way.	You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score.
Not an issue.	I'm the club pro, Tom Kite. How 'bout I give you a few pointers on your game? Now you don't want to over-think...
Huh?	Keep your head down.
Really?	Wow! Very impressive! You're a natural, Mr. Simpson.
Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?	And stay the hell out of my locker! You can keep the shoes.
Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?	Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.
Seat down.	Yeah. Can ya bank it into the handicapped stall?
Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for.	Bah. Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.
Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?	Uh-huh.
Yes.	Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph.
Woo hoooooooooo--	Yes.
Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge...	Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! The sand wedge!
He got to the green in one shot?!	Oh, a cunning stratagem, Sir. It's curving right toward the green... and... it's... there.
How - can - that - old - man - hit - SO - FAR?!!	He got to the green in one shot?!
And what are you doing with his ball?	Smithers, what are you doing up here?
And all those other balls?!	And what are you doing with his ball?
These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!	There are no other balls. Uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! Ooh, step away, they're endangered!
So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!	Cheating for me? Good lord, Smithers, that's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers! In all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-- Oh.
Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.	You know, Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club. If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, I'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight.
I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.	Homer, what are you doing?
"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""	We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. We're walking.
I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?	"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
I just won't say anything, okay, honey?	I won't say anything controversial.
You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are.	I just won't say anything, okay, honey?
Our savings?!	Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity. I like the way Lisa speaks her mind. I like Bart's... I like Bart. And I like my old green dress. I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown.
They have beer and gum, right?	Don't worry, I saved the receipt. We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel.
Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...	May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your Great Aunt Hortense. As her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate.
Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.	No, it's a standard clause.
Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts.	Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Best night's sleep I ever had.	Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?	Fill out schedule B. You should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.
Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.	You gotta hand it to Krusty.
Wow.	Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.
Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead.	I can't believe Krusty is really gone.
Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night.	By a nearly 2 to 1 vote, the smiling Krusty was chosen.
That's for my master to decide.	What kind of apprentice?
You think so?	How about town crier? You'd be great at that.
Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot.	Yeah, Dad! You're a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to.
You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!	Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!
Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! Chooseth Homer Simpson and he shalt rock thy world!	You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!
Less chat, more hat.	Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--
Woo hoo! Hear ye! Hear ye! The Homer Broadcasting System is on the air! All hollering, all the time! I'm gonna make the...	Less chat, more hat.
Okay.	You're to restrict your cryering to the parade, and selected pre-approved publicity events.
Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?	Uh, no.
I don't understand thee, Marge.	Toast.
No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?	Jebediah was really a vicious pirate named Hans Sprüngfeld. His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house fight!
Yes, that'd do.	He had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
The dastard!	He was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. He even tried to kill George Washington!
I believe you, honey.	Lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in Springfield or Stenchburg. You know why they chose Springfield? Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield was a true American hero. End of story.
Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor.	You do?
Well, nice talking to you.	This is nothing but dead white male bashing from a P.C. thug. It's women like you who keep the rest of us from landing a husband.
Lisa?	Well, nice talking to you.
I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat.	Miss Hoover thought I made the whole thing up. She called me a P.C. thug.
But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.	That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me.
Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case.	We could?
Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife.	Oh, you're back. And you've brought a friend.
Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!	Hey, stop! I've got nothing but respect for the office of town crier, but this is well outside your jurisdiction.
Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy I know.	Go! Go!
No, it's Homer.	Question: is your name Ridley Scott or James Cameron?
I'm just waitin' for my kid.	"Well, then I will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, ""Homer."" And if I see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know that you stole my idea."
Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention...	He wouldn't let me put it up.
Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield.	Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention...
DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!	Well, yes, but human decency prevents--
Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue!	DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!
What do we win if the tongue is there?	Yes.
What a jip.	Credibility.
Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home.	I was so sure...
No! Nooooooo!!	By the power vested in me, I hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell--
Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away.	Oh, Dad, I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to be in the parade.
Get lost!	Well, hey, it's Homer! Good to see ya, neighb--
Hear ye, HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!	Get lost!
All right! Liver!	Our first race is a benefit for daredevil Lance Murdock , who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver !
I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.	Aw, nuts to this. I'll just go get Homer Simpson.
Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?	Sor-ry. Next time get your own darned corn.
Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?	Yah. Now I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job, but actually it's just 2800 small jobs.
Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!	Montgomery Burns' office... Oh, hello Mrs. Burns... I'll see if your son is available.
Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog...	Uh-huh... Okay, I'll give him the message. Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave her for having that affair with President Taft.
Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties.	Simpson, eh?
Um, what do I do in case of fire?	Well, the van's leaving. Which one duty is giving you the most trouble?
Just my luck.	Sorry, can't hear you. Bye-bye!
Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson.	Good lord, Smithers! You look atrocious. I thought I told you to take a vacation.
But I think the dodo went extinct...	Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?	Get going! And answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills.
Lousy two-legged pants.	Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?
I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.	"Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""Little Rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.	Ah, poor Homie. Poor, poor...
Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!	Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.
Uh... they all won.	Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!
Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.	Eh? What about my options?
Yes, Sir, I did.	Did you get that report on the accounting department?
The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.	Yes, Sir, I did.
"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube."""	The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.
Hello. Mr. Burns' office.	"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.	Is it about my cube?
Yes! Yes, sir!	Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick!
I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir.	Now get cracking on my long division. And don't forget to show your work, Simpson.
No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division.	Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax.
Yello?... It's for you.	The telephone has been ringing for some time. Answer it.
No.	Is there something wrong, Homie?
Except... I killed Mr. Burns.	Except...
I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.	What happened, Dad?
Mr. Burns?	Okay. Maybe everything's all right. Maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. If he's alive.
Yes, sir.	No, please! I can't bear another thrashing. Just leave me be.
Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?	Now I can make my escape...
Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock.	Stay back, Homer! Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself.
Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?	Ahh, that's some nice reckless driving, Mr. B!
Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?	Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is 5-2-4-6. I suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy.
You shouldn't've gone away on vacation.	Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers... you're no longer needed at all. You're fired. Ta!
I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do.	Cheer up, Homie.
Mr. Smithers, wait!	I look forward to working with you!
You can't let yourself end up in a place like this. You've got two choices: You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. Or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back.	Mr. Smithers, wait!
You're on.	Mr. Burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties. But I'll wager dollars to donuts he still can't handle a call from his mother.
Got it.	Perfect. When I give the signal, you transfer the call to Mr. Burns. After she tears into him, I'll rush in and save the day.
I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns.	Got it.
Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother.	Ahoy-hoy? Hoy?
Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel!	Mrs. Burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more desiccated. And she doesn't call her son Mr. Burns!
You really blew it this time, Smithers.	Impersonate my mother, will you? And you, Smithers! You must have put him up to it! I'm glad I fired you.
Okay.	Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson.
I'll show you.	It's for you.
For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.	What did you get that for?
What am I -- a doctor?	Did he die?
Bye, kids. On your way back, pick up a six pack of beer.	Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
Oh, why can't they just take the gun?	I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. Homer, you go, too.
Will do.	Save our seats!
Aw, nertz.	Loser.
Which one's Itchy? The car?	Aw, nertz.
Oh. I guess that's not him then.	The mouse.
Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.	Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. And Dad's upstairs.
All right... Wait a minute. For what?	Hey Dad, can I have $1,000?
Forget it.	To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
Okay. Grampa.	That does it. One of them has to go.
Okay.	I've got it! Dad, give me $750!
Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!	Well, first off, here's your $1,000 back for hiring that lawyer. And $750 for the drawing. And here's a couple of bucks for your trouble.
What for?	Dad, can we have $183,000?
Oh... Forget it.	Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know.	"Dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?	That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!
"You know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? Why I heard..."	What are you talking about?
Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.	Hey, Homer, isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with Troy McClure?
Oh, I love legitimate theater.	This play has everything!
Down in front!	Oh... well... thank you...
I know! I know! It's Selma, right?	Oh, come on. Guess which one.
Aw, hell. Well... What about Dracula?	I know! I know! It's Selma, right?
Troy, buddy, I gotta know. What's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like Selma?	Aw, hell. Well... What about Dracula?
Okay.	Troy, buddy, I gotta know. What's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like Selma?
Hey, look what I snagged, Marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake.	This is the best day of my life.
That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle.	It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.
Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep.	What?!! Oh, my God!
'Cause they won't hire an assistant.	I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV.
Donut?	Ah, put this on and come with me, Son.
This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.	No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?
Uh... Oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs.	This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.	And now you've lost all but $600. You got greedy, Martin.
I don't know.	Maybe we can make your job more fun... What are those?
Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!	I'm going after him!
Hi, Lisa. How's your Spring Break going?	Hello?... Oh, Homie, hello! I can't remember the last time you called me from -- Oh, you want to speak to Lisa?
Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me...	I'm learning about owls.
You made it! Did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?	I concur.
Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?	Security guards?
The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs.	Sure!
Well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready?	Why do you need me?
They all have hilarious names and are delicious.	Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers? Razzles? Skittles? Whatchamacallit? Twizzlers?
Boy, Lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you.	Well, I am partial to Jolly Ranchers... Mmmmmm. Good work, Simpson. Simpsons.
Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store.	We could have a slumber party.
Eh... Truth. Ask me anything.	Okay. Time for truth or dare. You go first.
All right, dare.	Who do you love most: me, Bart, or Maggie?
Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball? First name, Ura?	Okay... Why don't you...
What?! How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran!	Ura Snotball?
Okay, your turn.	What?! How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran!
Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?	Hmmm... Truth.
I won't tell anybody.	Da-ad!
Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets.	Dad, you tell everybody everything. Even Moe knew when I threw up on the dentist.
I have no idea who that is.	Langdon Alger.
I've already forgotten his name. It was Larsen something, right?	Nobody does! He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. But that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
What's wrong, honey?	Whee.
Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend.	There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret.
I promise.	Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore... Okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart.
Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?	Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong.
Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?	No, no! Then he'll know I told! Dad, you said I could trust you.
Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge...	It's in Tennessee, right next to the Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb.
Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console.	...and Bart could be the courier!
And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of Homer J.--	Uh, I suggest you... Oh my God! Oh, God, no! Oh! This can't be happening! This... You're operating without a T-437, Springfield!! Oh, Sweet Mother of Mercy! I mean... I mean... My God!...
Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.	No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know!
Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!	Help! Help!
There. Done and done.	Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!
C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little...	It's okay. It's okay. I'm back. See, Daddy's here.
That's it, that's it, I...	C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little...
Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy!	... The dog!
Oh, bad dog! Bad dog!	Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy!
Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.	...And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy stories?
Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet.	No! Old people deserve our respect! Look at Jacques Cousteau and Goldie Hawn. You wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
Who is it?	Lemme in! Someone's trying to kill me! Sweet Merciful McGillicuddy, ya gotta open the door!
Bart's room.	But where are we going to put him?
Where are you two going at this hour?	Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast!
Oh, can I come?	On a treasure hunt.
Pass.	Only if you're ready to stare danger in the face, put your manhood to the ultimate test, and take--
"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family."	This is Kent Brockman with a special report from the Channel 6 newscopter. A large bear-like animal, most likely a bear, has wandered down from the hills, in search of food or perhaps employment. Please, remain calm. Stay in your homes.
Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer.	"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family."
All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer.	Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer.
Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.	All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer.
I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.	Well, things were bad everywhere.
Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?	Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen.
WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BEARS!	/ I am! / We are! / etc.
Oh, I heard it at the Mustache Parade they have every year.	Hey, Homer, that's a pretty catchy chant. Where'd you learn it?
Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears.	I phoned ahead.
Thank you, Honey.	That's specious reasoning, Dad.
Oh, how does it work?	By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
Uh-huh.	It doesn't work.
Uh-huh.	It's just a stupid rock.
Lisa, I want to buy your rock.	But I don't see any tigers around here, do you?
Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!	Lisa, I want to buy your rock.
Hey... how come my pay is so low?	Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!
"""Bear Patrol Tax: $5?!"" What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!"	Hey... how come my pay is so low?
Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.	Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.
Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.	That's the Home-Owner Tax.
Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn.	I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad.
Yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular Joes like you and me, Apu.	We had to move out once we'd filled the head with garbage. The end.
You? Pfft. I don't believe it.	Ah... Mr. Simpson? It may astonish you to learn that I am an immigrant.
Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about.	Oh, I wish... Oh, I wish I could have stayed just one more year or two. There was so much I wanted to see and to do and to have done to me.
You know what, Apu... I am really, really gonna miss you.	Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about.
Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.	Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin' in Springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language.
Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again.	Hey there, Homer, how's it hangin'?
Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue.	Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it. Say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. The NY Mets are my favorite squadron.
Don't forget Ganesha.	I have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland, and to myself.
Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!	I cannot deny my roots and I can not keep up this charade. I only did it because I love this land, where I have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever I want. I want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from Green Bay.
I never should have bought this button. Can I have my three dollars back?	Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!
Hey Marge, look what I brought home.	Store credit only.
No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake.	Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants?
And I'm not registered!	That's nice, although three of you are below voting age.
Hello, Selma? Selma my dear? How are you? Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?	Hey, Apu, why don't just marry some American broad, then dump her after you get your citizenship?
Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor.	Oh no. That is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of American history.
Please identify this object.	Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor.
Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?	It appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year.
Uh... partial credit.	Because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. The library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after New Mexico became a state but before Arizona did.
Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S, so let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield... Ah, right here.	Uh... partial credit.
No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college.	...Executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial.
Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history.	Please, Mr. Simpson, my brain needs sleep. The test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me.
What?	Dude, Karma.
Yeah, native Americans like us.	You know, Apu, in a way, all Americans are immigrants -- except Native Americans.
Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker.	No, I mean--
They're writing the operas that entertain us every day...	Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely...
They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society.	They're writing the operas that entertain us every day...
If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest Americans of all.	They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society.
"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"	He's right! / You said it, Homer! / etc.
NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO - ON - TWEN - TY - FOUR!	"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"
When are people going to learn -- Democracy doesn't work!	It's a landslide: Yes on 24! The Proposition passed with a record 95 percent--
Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!	"""Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."""
Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?	Dad?
"I see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."	Dad?
"I'm watching the road, sweetie. ""You jiiive turkey!"" See? You got to ""sass"" it. ""Quit jiiiving me, turkey!"" You gotta ""sass"" it. A turkey is a bad person."	Hullabalooza is a music festival -- the greatest music festival of all time.
But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?	Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir? Can you please change the radio station?
For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!	Nobody knows the band, Grand Funk? The wild shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drumwork of Don Brewer? Oh, man.
"And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like I'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""Yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" And then sometimes I switch it up like ""No, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""	For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!
No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music.	Dad, please. You're embarrassing us.
Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft...	No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music.
I'm just trying to party with you guys.	Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!
"Hi there! Been a while since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music. Where can I find the latest releases by ""Bread?"""	"Homer, first of all it's ""par-tay."" And second, we wouldn't par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth."
Oldies?	Oldies.
"But you've got all the top bands in here. Styx? I just heard them on ""The King Biscuit Flour Hour."" Now here are some of your no-name bands: Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, Hullabalooza..."	Oldies?
There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival.	Karma. Karma.
The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.	The what festival?
Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible.	Wicked!
But most of all, I remember the music.	Sandra, that was mean.
You make me feel like dancing...	But most of all, I remember the music.
You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it.	It's called rocking out.
No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever...	"I used to be ""with it."" But then they changed what ""it"" was. Now what I'm with isn't ""it,"" and what's ""it"" seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you."
Forever... forever... forever...	No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever...
I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy.	What's wrong, Homie?
That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!	Before we start -- We have a lost child here. If she is not claimed within the next hour, she will become the property of Blockbuster Entertainment.
I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.	Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse!
You're not going to school today. Today, your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher? Four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. Woo hoo!	This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic refreshment, eat Clark Bars. And for totally outrageous class rings, it's Josten's. Gooooo, Josten's!
Oh, my homemade Kahlua.	People, have your tickets out. Throw your cameras out. Surrender all identification.
Hey, a freak show!	Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people.
Oh, I get it.	It smells like Otto's jacket.
Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born.	Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat!
Well, excuuuuuuse me!	Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people.	You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while.
Alright. Yeah.	Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people.
Cool concert, am I right?	Alright. Yeah.
What did I say? What's going on?	Where's the Narc! / Who? / That fat Jamaican guy.
Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!	Don't commit your hate crimes here. Hate crime!
Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise.	Aw, making teenagers depressed is like shootin' fish in a barrel.
I'll never be part of the scene again!	Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise.
Uh-oh.	I'll never be part of the scene again!
I'm fine.	Dad, are you okay?
I don't think I have a choice, Marge.	So you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
How do you figure?	Of course you have a choice.
You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people...	You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?	And now, get ready for the man...with the iron stomach!
Thank you. Thank you very much.	Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?
"""Stay in school. Your hero, Homer."""	Thank you. Thank you very much.
Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide.	Hey, Cannonball -- I like your statement: When life takes a cheap shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins.
All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...	Dear Bart and Lisa...
Our first job is to entertain...	All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...
Woo hoo!	But the main thing is, I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics.
Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!	I don't even know anymore.
"We've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down	 if it's black, send it back."	Is it true that we have to bring our own water?
Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.	Hey -- I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the Audio Visual Club.
Anyway, get ready, beer belly! We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!	Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.
That was odd.	Alright, Homer! / etc.
No biggie. I'm cool.	Gee. I don't like the sound of that.
Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.	My God. Those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. From now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods, and when you lie in a hammock, please -- rest your beer on your head or your genitals.
Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?	Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to the gut... you will die!
People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great.	So what's it like being famous, Dad?
Nope.	Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?
You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity.	What religion are you?
What's with all the questions?	You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity.
Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do.	Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?
...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.	Do... wait... Do you... do you feel... do... do you feel...? oh, come on... Do you feel?
Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper.	I used to carpool with that guy.
Oh, I'm gonna die.	Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper.
Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich.	You're the coolest dad alive!
You have a desk?	Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak, unless that's his act. I expect your letter of resignation on my desk.
I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for.	I mean the hood of my car.
"You know what the song says, ""It's hip to be square."""	Dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool.
So lame that it's cool?	That song is so lame.
Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool.	Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried everything here.
I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?	Now they're trying it as a maritime offense. So anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? Free of charge.
Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little.	Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again.
Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light.	Lisa, let's go!
Well, I have been eating more...	Maybe you're getting stronger.
Bye-bye, job.	Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie. Bye-bye, tree.
"""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."""	"No, Springfield is ""America's crud-bucket."" At least according to Newsweek."
I left a few helpful notes around the house...	That was thoughtful.
I'll take that.	Put food in me.
Hello.	I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised.
Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge.	Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer, open the door for your Mystery Date!
Hey, he looks just like you, Poindexter!	"You got ""The Dud!"""
"You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!"	How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends?
Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two.	Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time.
All right.	Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it.
This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches.	"Check this out: ""Miss Perfect Attendance""."
No lighter?... Nothin'?	Fresh out.
Wait, I got it.	No lighter?... Nothin'?
Sweet merciful crap! My car!	This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids.	Uh huh.
Attic? Oh, that's silly. Seriously, though, don't ever go up there.	Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it.	Homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know.
Fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo...	Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it.
No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?	What's up there? / Is it a monster? / We have to know! / What's the secret?
Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?	Three! We have three kids, Homer!
Oh my God, Marge, it's escaped!	You went into the attic? I'm very disappointed and terrified.
Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity.	So I have two brothers?
We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.	But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town, the child was an outcast. So we did the only humane thing.
We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to.	We've got to find Hugo.
Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.	I'll start with Radio Shack.
We think we saw Hugo at the airport! He was boarding a plane to Switzerland and... Oh.	There, there, Hugo. I understand. All those years caged up in here... why, you've probably never even seen your own face in the mirror, have you? Here...
Lookin' good, son.	Your micro-jerks attacked me!
Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish.	She'll want socks, too. I'll get socks.
Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down there!	Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish.
What the-- whosa-- sonofa-	Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down there!
Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!	What the-- whosa-- sonofa-
I suppose you'll want to probe me. Well, might as well get it over with.	Hello.
I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C.	This is a mission of conquest. Take us to your leader.
Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole.	President Clin-Ton. Excellent.
Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!	Commence bio-duplication.
No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?	What? Are you still here? I'm afraid we'll have to dispose of you.
Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!	That's Slick Willie for you. Always with the smooth talk.
That's one of the creatures!	Sure you were, rummy.
These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!	Well, a refreshingly frank response there from Senator Bob Dole.
Stop! Those candidates are phonies!	My fellow Americans: as a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball. But tonight I say we must move forward, not backward... upward, not forward... and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!
You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!	Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
Oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?	Don't forget your stinkin' flag.
I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!	I am so mad at the secret service right now. Hey, who the hell are you?
It's in Cypress Creek. Upstate somewhere.	Oh no! What have I done? What am I doing? What will I do?!
Oh yeah. So long, Stinktown.	It's in Cypress Creek. Upstate somewhere.
America, take a good look at your beloved candidates! They're nothing but hideous space reptiles!	I am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will eliminate the need for a violent bloodbath.
Don't blame me. I voted for Kodos.	Ow! I don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet I never even heard of.
Marge! I've got a new job! It's with Globex Corporation. I get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. And they'll move us and give us a nice house and...	We'll have to go to the next most senior man at the plant. Ah, oh, here we are. Ten years experience. His name is...
Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?	You took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
But Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream.	We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library cards... Bart's lawyer is here.
Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.	What lifelong dream?
Just bring the rut with you, honey. Come on, take a look.	Homer, I don't want to leave Springfield. I've dug myself into a happy little rut here and I'm not about to hoist myself out of it.
Ah, let's watch something else.	Cypress Creek. A tale of one city...
Oh yeah, that's right. Let's watch this.	Homer! You're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
Well! What do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?	Your dreams may vary from those of Globex Corporation, its subsidiaries, and shareholders.
Thank you! Come again!	Hello. I am not interested in buying the house, but I would like to use your restroom, flip through your magazines, re-arrange your carefully shelved items, and handle your food products in an unsanitary manner. Ha! Now you know how it feels.
We'll never sell this rotten dump.	Thank you! Come again!
Heeeeey...	Even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage.
Yes.	Uh... Homer... Ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the TV trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in Cypress Creek?
Okily dokily.	Oh... uh...
I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.	Haw-haw.
Here we are, 15201 Maple Systems Road... Our new home.	Oooh!
Wow! My boss!	I am here to welcome you on behalf of the President of the Globex Corporation, me. Try the papayas. They're juicy and full of papayine. Makes you strong. Like Popeye. Popeye, papayine. Popeye, papayine. See, same thing? Same... Ah, forget it. How are ya? I'm Hank Scorpio.
Okay...	"Aw sure, I come later in the day, I get paid a lot more and I take longer vacations. But I don't like the word ""boss"". Hey, look at my feet."
Yes, once.	Ha! Ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?
Wowww.	"See you at work tomorrow! Although I don't really like to call it ""work""!"
Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.	You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual around here.
Wow.	Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls. Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat.
Uh... to work for you?	Having a place like this has always been my dream, Homer. What's your dream?
Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.	Don't do that. My butt is for sitting, not for kissing. Now you tell me the truth -- What's your real dream? Your real dream?
Yeah.	I bet people laughed at you when you told them that dream.
Ye... No.	Homer, don't give up. They laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat. I was the first wealthy man in America to ever do that. Now they all do it!... Didja ever hear of Mike Milken?
Don't worry. That won't take long.	Now Homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears and, should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. Your job will be to manage and motivate them. Give them the benefit of your years of experience.
All right.	I want you to close your eyes and fall backwards and I'll catch you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready?
Doh!	One second... Hello?
Are you guys working?	"Yes? What happened?... When did that happen?... How much of it?... Oh, my goodness, I'll be right up! Homer, I've got to go upstairs, there's a problem. Somebody ate part of my lunch. I'm gonna leave everything to you. We're on a tight schedule	 you keep them motivated."
Could you, um... work any harder than this?	Yes sir, Mr. Simpson.
Hey, call me Homer.	Sure thing, boss.
Hey, what's with you sad sacks?	I moved here from Canada and they think I'm slow, eh?
"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."""	Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!
I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!	Why don't you buy it?
All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!	I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!
Hey, if Tom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then I should just quit right now.	All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!
Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks.	I'm sorry, we're just a little tired, sir. We've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor on-line.
All right... What's the number?	Oh, hi, Homer! What can I do for you?
Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks.	All right... What's the number?
Uh-huh.	"Hammocks? My goodness, what an idea. Why didn't I think of that? Hammocks! Homer, there are four places: There's the ""Hammock Hut""	 that's on Third..."
Got it...	"There's ""Hammocks-R-Us""..."
Umm-hmmm...	"That's on Third, too. You got ""Put Your Butt There""..."
Yes...	That's on Third.
Right...	"""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot""..."
Oh, the Hammock District.	That might... Matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. It's the Hammock Complex, down on Third?
Fine.	Uh, Homer. One second. I gotta take care of this. Very important. 'Be right back.
Yes.	Back to the hammocks, my friend.
Oh.	"You know, there's a little place called ""Mary Ann's Hammocks"". The nice thing about that place is Mary Ann gets in the hammock with you. I'm just kiddin'."
No?	You know who invented the hammock, Homer?
Any sugar around here?	That's something for you to do. Find that out.
Uh... yessir. No problemo.	Hi, Homer! I'm keeping two of my fingers crossed that you're gonna have that nuclear generator up to full power by tomorrow.
France.	Good. By the way, Homer, what's your least favorite country, Italy or France?
I've never noticed this office before.	Nobody ever says Italy.
Eh, you have any sugar around here?	Why should you? -- It's mine.
Eh... I... no.	Here you go. Sorry it's not in packages. Want some cream?
Aargh!	Stop him! He's supposed to die!
Well...	Nice work, Homer. Am I prouda you!
I tackled a loafer at work today.	When you go home tonight, there's gonna be another story on your house. Thank you.
Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school.	I've been so bored since we moved here, I've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but I just can't drink that much.
What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions.	We want to go back to Springfield.
Uh, I've got a problem, Hank.	T minus 1 minute 35 seconds.
Well, it's pretty important.	Aw, gee, Homer, could it wait a sec, please?
Say, what's going on?	Well, it's pretty important.
Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government.	I'm having a little trouble with the government.
Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield.	What's the problem?
Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.	What's bothering them?
Well... Thanks for everything, Hank.	Homer, I'm disappointed, but I think you need to do what's best for your family.
"""Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."""	Telegram.
Aw, the Denver Broncos.	"""Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."""
Yeah yeah.	I think owning the Denver Broncos is pretty good.
You just don't understand football, Marge.	Well explain to me why it isn't.
Look, Marge! They opened a new high-tech gadget store! You love high-tech gadgets!	Weren't there three Indians last year?
Like bull you don't! Come on!	No, I don't.
No, I'm not!	Homer, please, you're hurting my arm!
Marge, look!	Night vision goggles? A bathroom scale from a Soviet sub? A suede briefcase-case? Oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems...
"""The World's Best Jacket!"" If I had this it would show everybody... show everybody!"	Marge, look!
Hey, what happened to your belt?	Can't you read? Call the police!
Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.	Some bullies beat me up and took it.
Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents.	But then they'll just beat me up even worse.
The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!	This is for the crummy life I've had to live!
Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.	Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down.
Really?	There ya go! That's the spirit! Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! Y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!
Dressing?	Aw, please, it's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!
You really think I could do it?	Their choice.
Yes!	Well, I dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?
Yes!	And are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?
YES!!	And are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?
Woo hoo!	I'll take it!!
Wow! I've never been in here before!	Now, Homer, if I'm gonna manage your boxing career, I wantcha to have complete faith in me. C'mere, lemme show ya somethin'...
You used to be a boxer just like me?	Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, I turned it into an office.
Hey, what's this?	"Yep. They called me ""Kid Gorgeous."" Later on, it was ""Kid Presentable."" Then ""Kid Gruesome."" And finally, ""Kid Moe."""
You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too.	Aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin' to empty that out.
Why not?	Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time.
Lousy Democrats.	'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row. That, plus politics. You know, it's all politics...
No problemo.	Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. You're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor.
Oh, why me?	"You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as ""Homer Simpson's Syndrome."""
Just a second.	Oooo-kay... Let's see the right.
All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All right... Wait a minute... Just a sec...	When you're ready...
Then I can just push him over.	Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching.
No one.	Who's gonna knock you down?
Never.	When are you gonna fight back?
Nothing.	What are you gonna do?
Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?	Okay. You're fighting a guy named Boxcar Bob.
Gee, thanks, Moe... What's this?	Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts. I hope you do better with 'em than I did.
You... didn't?	I gotta be honest with ya, Homer. I didn't bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper.
Uh, sure.	No. Homer, how would you like to be Heavyweight Champion of the World?
"Ooh, ""General!"" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?"	Great. All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum. It's this Saturday. Here's your parking pass.
Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance.	Uh, you know what? I'm gonna have to check on that...
Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!	Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?
Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --	Have you lost your mind?!
Marge, will you let me finish? ...Plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --	But you'll get killed!
Well, I don't think it's that unlikely.	Mom's right, Dad. The odds against you winning are a thousand to one.
All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr. Newspaper today.	Those are the odds they're giving in Vegas.
Gotcha.	All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?
Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--	Due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem. And now, Ladies and gentlemen, LET'S GET READY TO RUM-BLE!!!
Are you an angel?	Oh, my God! Simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting him out! Ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is literally flying out the window!
But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?	Yes, Homer, I'm an angel. All us angels wear Farah slacks.
Aaar, matey.	But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?
I can't remember where we parked.	Oh, Homie, are you okay?
Eh, not mine.	I got your tooth, Dad!
Where are you going?	Well, so long, Springfield...
Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today.	I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the World Series!
Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.	Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?
Can't they get a pole for that sign?	I can't excape Lisa, our little walking libary!
Ooh, let's pick him up!	That's a hitchhiker, Homer.
And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.	No! What if he's crazy?
Oh, yes we are!	We're not picking him up!
Oh, yes, there is!	There's not enough room!
And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final.	I just don't think it's a good idea.
He made fun of my weight.	He stole my fiancée.
Wow, that's really lazy.	Hey, relax. I don't wanna work. I'm so lazy, I took lessons on the player piano.
So lazy.	Lazy? You're not kidding. I'm like a rug on Valium, I'm talkin' lazy.
...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!	I see. Well, I... Oh, you know, I just remembered it's time for my annual donation. I wonder how much I should give...
Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.	I think we heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening.
Yes, sir. I do.	"Oh, ""yakkety-yak-yak""... You, Foodbag -- do you have a son?"
Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who...	And is he a constant disappointment? Does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them?
Eh, I should go.	I'll tell you what's with me -- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish, ignoramus for a son!
It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.	Sheesh, Dad and I, we started out great, but now it's fallin' apart, like a Chinese motorcycle.
Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping.	Yeah. I tell ya, I don't get no regard, no regard at all. No esteem, either.
Pho-ny kid-napping...	Yeah, right. I dunno, maybe I should just leave town.
Hiding out? Marge, you've been reading too many hideout books.	What are you doing in the basement? It's like you're hiding out down here.
Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.	And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?	Ahoy-hoy?
If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today.	Yes! I'm missing one son! Return it immediately!
Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money!	Oh, how much proof do you need? Five thousand? Six thousand? I swear, that's all I've got.
Just a second.	More important than money? Who is this?
No!	Can't we just go upstairs?
Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love.	Kidnapped?!
Still?	You know how I feel about hoaxes!
What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!	I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble.
The abandoned warehouse!	We gotta find someplace to hide!
Stupid economic recovery!	The abandoned warehouse!
We've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. Hel-lo!	Hey, buy a costume or get out, Fellas!
Heh-heh, they'll never look for us here.	Drive faster, Grandma! Grandma's gaining on us!
You don't like it, call the cops!	Some people are trying to watch the movie!
Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.	With pleasure, sir.
I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --	Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.
-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.	I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --
It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense.	And where is all that liquor coming from?
Sorry, sorry. My fault.	Da-ad! V-chip, V-chip!
Someone found my keys!	We interrupt this cartoon for a Special Report.
No problem... Can do.	Now, the cat needs his medication every morning --
Right... Uh huh... Gotcha... Cat in the furnace.	And the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--
A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.	Woo hoo!
You know, I don't know.	What time?
All right. Just wake me up.	Shall we say ten?
No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.	Dad, do I have to brush my teeth?
Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something.	I've got rocks that need washing at home.
Do I have to sit up?	Dad, I think I need some fresh air. Can I go to the park?
Knock yourself out.	No.
Just a minute!	We've got to hurry!
Hello.	Just a minute!
I have misplaced my pants.	Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very valuable stone gargoyle, and... are you wearing a grocery bag?
'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him.	I'm not going to press charges, but I assume you'll want to punish him.
No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day.	Well, if you won't discipline him, I'll come back and speak with his mother.
Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?	No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day.
C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit.	She makes me taste beer.
Yeah, well, I still get to punish you.	C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit.
Now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. It's called responsibility.	Yeah, well, I still get to punish you.
I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten.	It's eleven o'clock. Do you know where your children are?
Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!	I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten.
"What the... ""President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... Not pictured: Mrs. Eisenhower."""	Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!
I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --	I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Bart was filling in for --
working... so... late... that...	I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --
Yes, everyone loves rules...	Oh, I agree. Kids need rules and boundaries.
Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs.	It's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs and the drugs...
Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?	This is the National Air and Space Museum, isn't it?
Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that.	That's true, but I was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there.
Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's...	Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!
Hi! Now, Marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about Bart working in a burlesque house...	Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's...
No! I only learned that four days ago.	"""Maison Derriere""?! I can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent Bart to work there?"
I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!	What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?
Don't you worry, son.	Dad, we can't let this happen to Belle! Do something!
My friends! Stop!	Don't you worry, son.
Sure, we could tear this house down...	Please hurry.
No! My friends! Stop!	Sure, we could tear this house down...
Let me finish. We could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves...	No! My friends! Stop!
You could close down Moe's or the Kwik-E-Mart, and nobody would care / But the heart and soul of Springfield's in our Maison Derriere...	Let me finish. We could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves...
What are you doing, Marge? Didn't you hear the song?	Stop! No!
Take it off!	Chip!
Hey...	All right, Dad, you've been warned. Let's go.
Easy...	C'mon...
Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV.	Easy...
Yoink.	Is it really necessary to watch TV while we're eating? We're getting food all over.
Keep it down in there, everybody.	Hello Marge. How's the family? I don't want to talk about it. Mind your own business.
Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.	Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?
Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up.	Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. I pictured napkins... Homer, I want to throw a dinner party.
Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?	Oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?
Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.	Well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
Whaaaaaat?!	Homer?!
I just gotta put my shoes on.	Are you ready?
"You know what you two need? A little comic strip called ""Love Is."" It's about two naked eight year olds who are married."	Huh. I should have asked them to hurl some bacon, then maybe I coulda had a decent breakfast for once.
Shut up and let the woman talk.	"You wanna talk? Go ahead, Luann, talk! Why don't you tell 'em one of your little bedtime stories, huh? Like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser	 or how about the one about how I carry a change-purse? Yeah, a purse!"
Boring!	Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story. It's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory...
Ooh, here we go!	A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence...
That's a door?	It's a door. Use it!
G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well.	Oh, okay. Ta-ta, I'm off to the beauty salon.
Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago.	I feel terrible. The Van Houtens split up at our party.
You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.	"I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They were so insulting: ""You are a coward."" No one likes to hear that after a nice meal."
The one down the hall.	Uh, singles life is great, Homer. I can do whatever I want. Today I drank a beer in the bathroom.
I sleep in a big bed with my wife.	I sleep in a racing car. Do you?
Thanks for introducing me.	That's Jerry. He's a major player down at the sewing store.
For what?	Homer, get ready!
I don't wanna go to that.	Remember? Luann and Chase are taking us out to hear Spalding Gray.
That doesn't sound like something I'd say.	You said you'd do it as a favor to me.
Okay. Love you.	Fine. I'll go without you.
"""Can I Borrow A Feeling?"" ""Can I Borrow A Feeling?"" There's your picture on the front."	Oh! My demo tape!
I already did.	Go ahead, Homer. Laugh at me.
Oh yeah. You gotta do that.	You know why all this happened, don't you? 'Cause I took my marriage for granted. Y'know, in twelve years, I never once helped out with the housework.
Oh, and for yourself.	I could've at least stayed in shape for her.
It can't just be sex. It can't.	I could've taken just a little time to... to make her feel special.
Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me.	God, I was so self-centered. No wonder I didn't see it coming. That's how it is, though: one day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink.
'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.	Oh, how do you know? What makes you guys so special?
Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!	'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
"""Dear Homer,"" aww. ""Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner. They're thawing in the sink."""	Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!
Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old and I don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage.	Hi, Dad. You know, there's buns in the cabinet.
All right.	Oh, okay. Can I stay up?
As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and I think your mom might not be happy with me.	All right.
'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.	You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. Why would she leave you now?
Mm-hm.	You mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot.	She knows.
That's your advice?! Go to bed!	You're very lucky to have Mom.
Good morning. You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests, so I wandered over to that theater you went to last night. And I bought tickets to their entire season.	That's your advice?! Go to bed!
"Look -- ""Mostly Madrigals."" Hey, that might be good. Ooh, ooh, ""An Evening With Philip Glass."" Just an evening? ""Voices of the Elderly Poor."""	Good morning. You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests, so I wandered over to that theater you went to last night. And I bought tickets to their entire season.
Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you.	Homie, I appreciate this, but I'd really like to get some sleep.
I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?	Edmondo, don't you think you're taking a lot off -- Ah!... Homer! What are you doing?!
Ooh! You're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.	None! They would have more sense than that.
Oh, I've just made things worse. A few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. Marge deserves someone who will treat her right. Marge deserves a fresh start.	Homer, I don't need you around me 24 hours a day. I'm a grown woman -- I can take care of myself. Now, will you please just go away!
I'd like to file, for divorce.	Oh, I've just made things worse. A few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. Marge deserves someone who will treat her right. Marge deserves a fresh start.
Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.	Only three cavities, Bart. Your best check-up ever. I'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken.
No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you.	Why? Am I pregnant?
Yes, we do. I got us a divorce this afternoon.	Oh, Homie. I know you love me. We don't need to get married again.
I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV. This one is for real. I want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like Kirk and Luann.	What?
Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.	Dearly beloved --
Okay, ready.	Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.
It doesn't matter. All I want to know is: Will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?	I will now read the special vows which Homer has prepared for this occasion. Do you Marge take Homer, in richness and in poorness?... Poorness is underlined... In impotence and in potence? In quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered monkey-navigated -- And it goes on like this.
Whaddya mean?	Good morning. One donut with sprinkles, and... Wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, Sir!
Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was.	You have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!
Hey, what's this thing?	Ah, looks like we put the kibosh on another two-bit telephone swindle, boys. Frankly, I would've expected better from Jimmy the Scumbag.
Telemarketing, eh?	Huh? Oh, that's an auto-dialer. This bird was using it to pull a telemarketing scam, but instead he's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years -- bread and water, icy showers, guards whompin' your ass 'round the clock, and the only way out is suicide.
I won't.	An automatic dialer? Is that legal? I don't want you getting arrested, Homer...
Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.	Or swindling our neighbors.
Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!	Hmm. One dollar for eternal happiness... Mmmm, I'd be happier with the dollar.
Tele-panhandling.	But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. It's nothing but panhandling!
Woo hoo! Two dollars! It's working!	Okay... But if anybody sees us, I'm just there to steal your bike.
Oh, no you don't!	Why it's the AT-5000 Autodialer, my very first patent! Aw, wouldja listen to the gibberish they've got you saying! It's sad and alarming. You were designed to alert schoolchildren about snow days and such. Well, let's get you home to Frinky. Hope your wheels still work.
Will you two shut up?! People are trying to sleep!!	That is it, Ned! If you don't unplug that phone right now, you're sleeping on the lawn!
Lisa's window is the next one!	Lisa! The cops are chasing me. I need a place to hide!
Shut up!!	Ned, did you plug that phone back in?!
Hey, who shot the auto-dialer? Marge's auto-dialer?	Well, that thing's been drivin' the whole town nuts! Got me out of the bath seven times. Seven!
... Is it... Wah?	Dad, wake up!
Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield.	I think a hurricane is coming!
Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know.	What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies?
Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel.	Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra.
I would make it my business to be a third wheel.	No, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--
Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!	Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage.
Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.	Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
All clear, everyone.	It's dying down!
Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?	Dad, no! This may just be the eye of the hurricane.
See? I told you it was over.	Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?
Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being th--	See? I told you it was over.
He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!	The hurricane's over.
Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.	Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for.
Talk to me!!	I'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
Well, call us if you need anything.	Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left.
Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love.	Glad to do it. / Sure. / Happy to help out. / Etc.
The living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...	No, no, not me, friends -- he's talking about himself! But thanks for looking!
Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad.	Uh-huh. Ooh, looks like a loose nail.
Your beautiful kitchen, Ned. Just as you remember it.	Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad.
So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?	Well, I've seen about enough.
Aw, shoot.	So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?
Hey, I got off pretty easy.	Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met.
Beer! Gimme some beer!	All right, all right, just watch it there. I'm here to help, you know. Now, I'd like to try something -- is there any person who makes you particularly angry?
"Yello? Yes... Mental hospital? I don't know any ""Ned Flanders."""	Beer! Gimme some beer!
Oh, him.	The man who lived next door until his house blew down.
I... What?	Homer, can you be that annoying?
"""Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others."""	Get in the booth.
Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.	Mmm. He's not responding. Proceed to Level Two Antagonism.
"""I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other."" Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?"	Ah, he's still repressing. Maximum hostility factor.
Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly.	Ho ho ho. Very funny, wise guy.
You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human.	Hi, neighbor!
Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.	Homer!
C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?	Um, did you like it?
What about, uh, fluorescent lights?	Mmm, mmm. 'Sure are fun to scratch. Mmm. Satisfying.
See? You like everything.	Oh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light.
"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"""	Ned, you so crazy.
Hey, who cut something out of my paper?	"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"""
Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?	Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains.
Where? To the big annual what?	Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?
Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper.	Where? To the big annual what?
Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off...	Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper.
Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!	Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off...
You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.	Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco.
What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!	No, Homie, wait!
I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!	What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!
Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!	All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good reason. Every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. Remember last year?
Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah!	Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!
Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?	Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer.
Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!	"Eight spices! Oh, some must be doubles. ""Or-uh-GAHN-o?"" What the hell...?"
Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.	Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!
Stupor Pooper.	Remember your promise: no drinking.
Five-alarm chili, eh?	They say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon.
One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?	Um-hm.
Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh.	Woo-woo!
Hello, Chief.	That Simpson, he thinks he's the Pope of Chilitown. Well, this year I am ready for him!
Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold.	Grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum.
But I need it!	You promised you wouldn't drink!
Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss...	But I need it!
Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do.	You don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you?
Outstanding.	Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do.
Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is.	His ears if we're lucky!
Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it.	Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is.
Ooh. I don't feel so good.	Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it.
Flanders! You gotta help me!	Ooh. I don't feel so good.
Where am I? Shelbyville?	What's happening to me? Okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan insanity peppers. Then I -- Ohhhh.
Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!	Where am I? Shelbyville?
Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils...	Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!
Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.	Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils...
Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET...	Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.
Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!	No beer, huh? I guess I know what a promise from Homer J. Simpson is worth.
Huh? A tortoise?	Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!
Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!	Huh? A tortoise?
Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo.	"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!"
This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?	Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo.
Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?	Your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. Or a police car.
Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad.	Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?
Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?!	Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad.
Who said that?	You are on a quest for knowledge.
Hiya.	Fear not, Homer. I am your spirit guide.
If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you.	There is a lesson you must learn.
Yeah, that's me all right.	No, I speak of a deeper wisdom. The problem, Homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once.
But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?	Clarity is the path to inner peace.
You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!	Are you kidding? If anything, you should get more possessions. You don't even have a computer!
Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya.	Sorry. I am a coyote...
Soul mate?	Good. Your mind is in a state of readiness. So listen well: To make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate.
That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge.	Your kindred spirit. The one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding.
Hey, wait! Come back!...	Is it?
A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!	Hey, wait! Come back!...
Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!	Hey, get off the course, you bum! Security!
Carl?	Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!
And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.	Carl?
Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog.	Hi, Homer. Find your soul mate.
Hi, kids.	So then I says to Mabel, I says...
Where's your mother?	I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad.
Hi, honey.	So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says...
Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night...	Hi, honey.
Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate.	"I'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer."
Okay.	"Don't ""soul mate"" me!"
That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common...	Okay.
Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason...	That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common...
Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here.	Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason...
...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking?	Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here.
Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer.	This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir. Now if you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave.
Well what about you, Lenny?	Okay, but I'm not your soul mate. I'm really more of a chum.
Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up.	I'm a well-wisher, in that I don't wish you any specific harm.
Where? Where?!	Find your soul mate, Homer. Find your soul mate.
Huh. What's that blinking light?	This is just your memory. I can't give you any new information.
The lighthouse keeper!	Huh. What's that blinking light?
The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!	The lighthouse keeper!
Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!	The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!
Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl....	Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!
A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow!	Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl....
Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!	Either that or Batman has really let himself go.
A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!	Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!
Come here, people!	A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!
Well, I won't be lonely for long....	Aye... the hotpants.
Marge?	Oh, Homer, thank goodness you're safe!
Really? You were? But how did you find me?	I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried...
"Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign."	Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. And I was sure you'd head west, because Springfield slopes down that way. And then I saw the lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron...
Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because...	Yeah.
Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus...	...we had a fight?
Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters.	...and you're from Mars.
...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...	Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep...
Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!	...a profound mystical understanding?
We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote!	Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!
Omigod! The ship!	Space coyote?
The light! We gotta get the light back on!	We'll all be killed!
They see us! They're starting to turn!	Aye, port.
We sure did... soul mate.	We did it!
TGIF! Guys, I'm off to Moe's.	Our story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called Springfield.
"Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called ""The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down."" First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so..."	But Homer, it's ten in the morning.
Then, I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop...	"Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called ""The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down."" First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so..."
Nah, it's Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special.	Another Duff, Homer?
Skoal! Wait a minute -- this is Duff!	Uh, here you go. Düff. From Sweden.
Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on.	"Ah, ha ha, you got me, didn't ya? All right, here you go -- ""Red Tick Beer."""
Well, it's one a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids.	Hmm... needs more dog.
Eh, I guess I'll walk home.	Just a second, Homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home.
No time for you, old man!	Oh, son, I'm glad to see ya. I went for the morning paper and I got lost, and...
Please, don't hurt me!	Aww.
Yaaaa...	Don't be afraid.
Uh!	Yaaaa...
"It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, ""Don't be afraid!"""	Homer, it's two a.m.! What happened?
No! Well, ten beers...	Have you been drinking?
I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.	No! Well, ten beers...
Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!	Maybe you just dreamed it.
So?	"Dad, according to ""Junior Skeptic Magazine"" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours."
Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!	I am the thing from Uranus!
Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?	It's your birthday?
Lousy loveable dog.	Good doggy. Good doggy!
Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait, that was my physical.	Lousy loveable dog.
The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night -- like Urkel!	Great story, Homer. Really.
You don't have to humiliate me.	Well, your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass... I mean, uh, Simpson. So I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter.
No, I'm sorry.	Yo!
Yes.	Now we're going to run a few tests. This is a simple lie-detector. I'll ask you a few yes-or-no questions and you just answer truthfully. Do you understand?
Ow.	Yes.
Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.	All right, Homer. We want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien.
We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?	Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI.
You are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that.	We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- Hey, a penny!	It's not a monster! It's Mr. Burns!
I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods.	Homer, why don't you show us where you went when you left the bar?
"Oh, Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""I believe you, Homer."""	Who'd've thought a whale could be so heavy? Cheese it. The Feds!
You do?! Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!	I don't believe you, Homer.
Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now.	You're not listening. You're only hearing what you want to hear.
No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?	Homer, please! I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. Please just let it be.
No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous?	Please, let's just go to sleep.
Well then, good night!	No, I'm not.
Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too.	Hey, Dad. What's the word from Planet Crackpot?
You do?	Well, actually, Dad... I believe you.
Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?	Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure.
That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!	Hell, yes.
We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.	What if we don't?
Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.	They'll buy anything!
Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddies, and kids with fake IDs... besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story?	Yo, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?
No! No! No-o-o-o-o!	And that is how much college will cost for Maggie!
Yeah, me too.	You know, Dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I've really had a great time out here.
It's him!	Yeah, me too.
As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say...	I bring you peace.
Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!	As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say...
It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.	Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!
Good work, son! We did it! We did it!	Oh yes we do! I got it all on tape.
Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!	But first, E.T. phone Homer -- Simpson that is!
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Doctor Hibbert?	I think there must be a more logical explanation. And I think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.
Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.	Yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based?
Uh, yes.	Is the alien Santa Claus?
This interview is over!	Uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?
"Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any ""Homer is a Dope"" T-shirts, do you?"	Surprise me!
I'll take two!	"These shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! And look at the fine stitching on ""Dope!"""
Look! There it is!	I'll take two!
Thanks, Marge.	Well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you, Homie.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail?	...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about.	Well, maybe it's all for the best...
Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.	What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about.
No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!	Well, that's the miracle of the franchise. You get all the equipment and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand name people trust. You'll be on a rocket ride to the moon. And while you're there, would you pick up some of that nice green moon money for me, Royce McCutcheon.
Oh yeah.	Marge.
Uh, your fish are dead.	Did you know that disco record sales were up 400% for the year ending 1976? If these trends continue, aaaayyyyyy...
Hey, pretzels!	Don't forget fat people. They can't stop eating!
Hey, what's all that commotion outside? Why, it's one of those Pretzel Wagons the movie stars are always talking about.	Now, you're ready to make pretzels. Open your bag of ingredients... ...check for millipedes... Eiw.
That's right, Lenny. Let's all give in to deliciousness, the Pretzel Wagon way.	Here? Our plant?
That means thank you, Marge.	Thank you.
You could call 'em Whitey Whackers.	Oh, cheer up, Mom. You can't buy publicity like that. Thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford.
Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can...	Dinner's in the oven. If you want some butter, it's under my face.
Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty well for himself.	Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can...
I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.	Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty well for himself.
Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate.	Of course. Right this way.
You're my last hope. I've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. Your help could make all the difference in the world.	They were in the same car.
I had a feeling things would work out for you, honey.	Hello? Uh, no, Pretzel Wagon's no longer -- Three hundred pretzels?! Wait, wait, let me get this down. Mmm... Mmm... Meatpackers Union Hall... Batavia, New York... I'll send them right out! Homer, Homie, wake up! Wake up, I'm back in business!
Thanks, Moe.	Here you go, Homer.
Yeah, my wife is raking it in.	Hey, wait a minute -- this is real money!
Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?	Greetings, Homer.
You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir.	Now, the time has come for you to do us a favor.
In those words? Yes.	Homer, did you tell the Mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?
How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.	Oh, it just sickens me. How could you do this to someone you love?
So what are we gonna do?	Oh, Homer, I know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the Mafia's not getting one cent of my money!
Now what?	Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa.
"You heard her. She said ""no."""	"I'm afraid I must insist. You see, my wife, she has been most vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies: ""Where's the money?,"" ""When are you going to get the money?,"" ""Why aren't you getting the money now?,"" and so on. So please, the money."
But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet.	Homie, maybe we should go inside.
Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you know it's gonna be good!	But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet.
Hey, that's the fire alarm!	Alright, popcorn's ready!
I think I won, Mr. Burns.	Damnation! What kind of slowcoaches do I have working for me? Ah, here comes one of our fellows now.
Woo hoo!	Yes, you won all right. You won more than you bargained for.
Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!	No, you take that back!
So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.	Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!
Huh?	Teamwork is overrated.
Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway.	Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
Well, here we are.	Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway.
Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.	All right. Let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park. This will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life. I cannot overemphasize the dangers which... did you bring your family, Simpson?
Uh, I lost my map.	Each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain. The routes are treacherous, so use your maps.
Hey, this sounds like fun.	"Now as an added incentive, the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious ""World's Worst Employee"" trophy."
Uh-oh.	And the last team to arrive will be fired.
Oooh.	I've placed all your names in this hat--
Uh, not as such.	Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you?
Yes, lotta hysteria...	"Neither would I. I've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about so-called ""cheating""."
Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!	Mmm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say, cheating is the gift Man gives himself.
Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns.	Horseless sleigh.
No sir. I am not.	Yes, well, I'm older than you. You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met.
That worked sooo well.	Eh, I'm actually a little more concerned about us. Um, do you know how to weld?
No going through the window for us!	Now we have electricity. This propane tank will supply us with heat, and this doorknob, properly turned, will allow us access to the cabin.
You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny.	Well, I don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early, Homie old boy. More champagne?
Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.	Oh, yes, but I'd trade it all for a little more.
Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?	Oh, yes, sitting. The great leveler. From the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?
Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip.	The only hard part is getting up.
Oh?	Why, you'd have to get up.
Use it wisely, my friend.	Sir, I am in your debt.
You got it, buddy.	Hope that wasn't an avalanche. Be a chum and have a look-see.
Um, I don't see one. Unless...	Isn't there any way out of here?
No. There's no way out.	Um, I don't see one. Unless...
You can supervise me.	Simpson, I have a confession. I'm not quite the tunnel digger I made myself out to be.
We sure did!	All right, good. Let's dig... That's right, dig some more... Oh, we make quite a duo: Burns and associate. No, no, what am I thinking? Burns and... teammate.
I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.	What happened?
Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .	We... should... be... careful... not... to... speak... unless... it's... absolutely... positively... necessary.
I think they've stopped. .	Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
So what?	Those last three avalanches were your fault, Simpson.
It could be days before they find us.	We must be covered by a thousand feet of snow.
We could build snowmen.	Ech! I heard that one 75 years ago.
Oh... Okay.	No, I have a better idea! We could build real men. Out of snow.
Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!	What about our dad?!
Agreed.	I... I think we should dress the snowmen.
Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns.	Look at them. Smug and secure in their finery. Mocking us.
What do we do?	Ah, snowmen have peepers. Peepers to watch. To watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down.
You and what army?	I'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery.
Burnsie!	Homer!
Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house.	We'll be dashed to pieces.
Marge, kids.	Oh, something's wrong with its brakes! Gangway!
You said it, ya weirdo.	Well, Simpson, I must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.
Marge, get me a beer.	No.
Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.	It's my hair. Excuse me.
Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers.	Who cares?
Eww.	Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers.
Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball on ESPN...	Eww.
Oh, There's no way I could --	All right... but don't be shocked.
Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!	Homie, I'm losing my hair.
Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it.	I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
But how am I supposed to pay for that?	A nanny?!
Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar.	And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!	But he didn't do anything!
All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... I'll give up the Civil War Re-creation Society I love so much.	Homie, please, I never ask for much, but this is something I really need.
Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!	Pleased to meet you.
You're phony! Fakey phony broad!	Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!
Sorry.	Homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one.
I like him!	I'm here about the nanny job. I'll keep a watchful eye on your kids, and if they get out of line-Pow!
I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.	Thanks. Hey, where do you keep the liquor?
You have my undivided attention.	That's Carl.
MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.	TEACH US SONGS AND MAGIC TRICKS.
AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--	THE NANNY WE WANT IS KINDLY AND SAGE.
Did you say Mary Pop--	Hello. I'm Shary Bobbins.
Now Ms. Bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. First, do you have any bad habits?	Put me down for one of each.
Well, so am I.	No, I'm practically perfect in every way.
Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?	Well, so am I.
Marge, do we know them?	Lord and Lady Huffington of Sussex.
Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?	No.
Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?	Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?
Ooh, she is tough.	I make you read every article in that magazine, including Norman Mailer's latest claptrap about his waning libido.
I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.	My, she seems too good to be true.
Come to bed, Marge.	That Shary Bobbins is a miracle worker. The kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. It's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!
No, no. Leave it in.	Ooooh.
NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.	CAN I BE A BOOZEHOUND?
Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding.	Oh, thank you.
Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you.	The secret ingredient is blood.
You've changed me as well. I'm no longer the money-driven workaholic I once was.	We'll miss you, Shary Bobbins.
Shary Bobbins! I want another beer!	"Welcome back to ""Before They Were Famous."" We all know Rainier Wolfcastle as the star of the blockbuster ""McBain"" movies. But here's his first appearance -- in a commercial in his native Austria."
You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.	Well you know, Homer -- IF THERE'S A JOB THAT MUST BE DONE / YOU'LL FIND IT'S MUCH MORE FUN.
Oh, that poor woman.	SEARCHING FOR MY LOST SHAKER OF SALT... OH, HERE IT IS.
Nope.	But haven't I taught you people anything?
Indubitably!	So you like it this way?
AROUND THE HOUSE, I NEVER LIFT A FINGER / AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER I'M SUB-PAR / I'D RATHER DRINK A BEER THAN WIN FATHER OF THE YEAR / I'M HAPPY WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE.	Indubitably!
SHUT UP, FLANDERS.	THEY'RE NOT PERFECT, BUT THE LORD SAYS LOVE THY NEIGHBOR --
I'm sure we will, honey.	Do you think we'll ever see her again?
I'm sure we will.	I'm sure we will, honey.
Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie.	'Morning, Roy!
I do not!	You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice.
I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.	Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."	Well, here. Say something.
Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice.	"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
"Oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? Not ""in-your-face,"" huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!"	Now that's just bad. You got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next.
Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.	That's it! That's the Poochie attitude!! Do that again!
Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog.	Then you don't get the job. Next!
Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you.	That's it! You've got the job!
She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again.	Okay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your voice.
You? But you're a lady.	Relax, Homer, you'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy.
Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?	She's a lady, all right. A beauuutiful lady.
"You mean ""meep meep""?"	"Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Road Runner -- ""Meep!"""
Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?	You folks ready to begin?
"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"	What's that name again? I forgot.
What the hell are you talking about?	Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy and Scratchy CD-Rom, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?
Quiet! You're missing the jokes!	Can somebody tell me what the hell is goin' on? Midge, help me out here.
Well? What did everybody think?	Eh, that stunk!
So it was pretty okay, huh?	Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer. You, uh... you got a beautiful home here.
Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?	Yes we can!
You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!	I have to go now. My planet needs me.
Put a sock in it, Roy.	Right on, Mr. S.!
No I am not.	Are you prepared to die, Poochie?
Never!	"Oh, cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Just stick to the script as written, Homer. You're supposed to say ""Please, cut off my head, I don't deserve to live."""
You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.	Never!
Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together.	Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you?
Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten Superbowls. I don't want to oversell it. Judge for yourselves.	And... cut!
Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!	I guess...
Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again.	No refunds! Force majeure! Read the back of your ticket!
That is so true.	I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear.
What happened?	Hey, Lis, check it out! Pogo Stilts! These were banned in all 50 states!
Give her a break! Her husband was killed!	"Oh, you should see the crossword puzzle! She thought that ""Mindy"" lived with ""Mark!"""
Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!	We work hard, we play hard!
Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.	Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!
No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man.	Oh, but this is the Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator! Don't you just love the graphics on this box?
Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies.	It's camp! The tragically ludicrous? The ludicrously tragic?
And that kind of stuff is worth money?	"Well, sort of... But I mean more like inflatable furniture or ""Last Supper"" TV trays or even this bowling shirt. Can you believe someone gave this to Goodwill?"
Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!	Boy howdy!
I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?	Well, if you're inviting me over --
Do I know you?	Oh, man, you weren't kiddin' about this place! Well, I just love it!
Ow! Why you little...	Oh!...
Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat.	Dad! Dad! Company! Company!
That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.	Oof! Homer, you are the living end!
Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there...	Mmm, I don't think he's married, Homer.
Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.	Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?
Who doesn't?	He prefers the company of men!
Right...	Homer, listen carefully: John is a ho-mo--
Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!	You're being ridiculous.
Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way.	I'm very sorry you feel that way. Because John invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going.
You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming.	What on earth are you talking about?
No! No, no, no, no...	Homer, at least come out and say hello.
No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!	Come on. You liked John this morning.
How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?	Don't do this to me, Waylon!
Oh, and I'm not.	Oh, geez Louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. John's a witty, urbane person.
Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?	Hey, Dad, look what I got! Zzzapp!! Zzzapp! Zzzapp! Zzzapp!
Uhh... huh.	I'unno. Came outta the closet.
There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me.	Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!
Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?	So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?
All right, boy! Come on! Today we're gonna--	Homer, I don't think there's a problem with Bart. But if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. Goodnight.
You! I should have known!	I don't, but I loved hearing it!
Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!	Homer, John brought us cactus candy!
No.	Well, now you don't get any candy. No, that's cruel. Take a teensy piece.
You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!	Homer, what have you got against gays?
No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just...	Oh, Homer, please. You're embarrassing yourself.
"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!"	Queer?
Homer storms out.	"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!"
Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds.	Homer storms out.
Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.	What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?
Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you.	Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.
... as a father! A father!! A regular father!! Whooh!	Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you.
Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.	What am I supposed to do here?
Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?	Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?	I'unno. I kinda want a cigarette.
Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will...	Anything slim!
Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?	Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will...
Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.	Roscoe.
You'll thank me on your wedding night.	Why the hell would I want to see that?
Has the whole world gone insane?	Hel-lo!!
I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!	Dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?
Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!	Oh, be nice.
Oh, my God, what's happening now?	Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!
But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!	Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast.
Hunting, eh?	Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!
Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?	What? You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!
It just does! Name me one gay Indian!	But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?
Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?	Uh-oh, something's gonna die!
Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!	"I know this much: I wouldn't wear that hideous hat. Here, take this one -- it was worn by Yale Summers in ""Daktari."""
No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!	Oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive Betsy. Right.
That is a very immature attitude, young man.	Nope. Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --	Hey, those ain't your rats, Barn. Well, Homer, you ready to call it quits?
Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian.	C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man.
No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.	...Aw, geez, Homer! Geez! You and Marge ain't cousins, are ya?
Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!	Well, the only thing around here that's even close to deer is....
Yep, and it's your shot, son.	Huh? You did? Wait, man, those are reindeer.
C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?	What? I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer.	Aw, criminy! Here come the waterworks.
Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!	Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer.
Me too, son.	Dad, I'm scared.
Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!	No, don't! You have to protect yourself!
UNNGHH!!	Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!
Just... my bones... and organs...	Dad, are you hurt?
What the -- ?	Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!	What the -- ?
It's a miracle!	Whoa, it's Santa, all right! And he is kickin' ass!
I've been tenderized.	Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe! Hmmm, you feel softer than before.
"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"	Stop, you idiots!
Amen to that.	Great! Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life. Now if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.
Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me.	Amen to that.
Oh, all those stairs...	Ho-mer.
Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --	Oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey.
And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --	We're very proud of you, by the way.
In a medium-security prison.	But he's safely locked away!
Unless he gets out somehow.	For life!
Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before.	Which is impossible!
Yeah! You do your own dirty work!	You can't ask God to kill someone!
Lisa too?	Madam, your children are no more!... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers.
Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners.	Especially Lisa. But especially Bart. If he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, I can't be held responsible for my actions.
Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!	Heh, funny, isn't it, Lis? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction.
You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.	Oh, that sounds fabulous, Homer. Stores throw the best parties.
The important thing is I didn't imagine it.	You didn't remember that. You just saw it on TV.
Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses.	Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort.
Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh...	Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?
I'll have to ask her.	Please, please, please!
Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.	Hey, Dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?
Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot.	Why you wearing it now?
Can you see the pie stains?	And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!
Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says.	Dad, help me out!
Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!	You are so dead.
All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked.	Uh, I don't think we should be driving here. The mayor's yelling at us.
You've never been?	Oh, it's so beautiful! This is what I imagine Paris must be like!
Nah, I'm really more of a slacker.	"I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. I guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, Homie?"
Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!	Oooh, Malaria Zone! That's where all the explorers shop.
Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs.	Isn't that clever? It looks like a Cadillac drove right into the building.
You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together-- AAAGH!	And you'll never baby-sit again!
Did you see that, Marge?	You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together-- AAAGH!
What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved Jello shooters.	"""Complete confidentiality?"" Oh. And I'm sure he's as good as Dr. Hibbert. It says so right in his ad."
Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one.	Oh, I do. I'm just a little concerned about the kids. Maybe I should call.
Give me the drugs, Lisa.	And she is on DRUGS!!!
It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm still not drunk yet. Oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock.	No one's pinching his legs.
Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to come in and drink, please!	It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm still not drunk yet. Oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock.
Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!	Yay, Bart!!
I'll come with you.	I'm going down to Moe's for a coupla beers.
Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?	No! No more drinking! I'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.	But what's the solution? Are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive the antiquated notion of prohibition? Channel Six says yes.
Glad you're finally back in business, Moe.	Dateline: Springfield. With prohibition back in force, sobriety's peaceful slumber was shattered by its noisy neighbor: the speakeasy!
At first I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work.	See that you do.
No.	Hey, hi, can I arrest any of you people for anything?
Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!	Aw, geez. I don't have anything to do anymore. With Banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. And so am I.
Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...	Sounds like you have a plan.
C'mon, boy, think of a plan.	Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...
We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back, avenge our deaths.	I've got it!
Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone.	Whoa, bonanza! Let's load it up before the rats regroup.
Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope.	Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone.
Really? I heard good.	Dad! Knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
Nothin'.	What happened to you, Homer? And what have you done to the car?
Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past.	I don't think it had broken axles before.
Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.	That's funny... I used to be able to go down there.
Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!	Why do you have so many bowling balls?
You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism.	Forty-five bucks?! Well, this better be the best tasting beer in the world! You got lucky...
Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast was clear. Aw, it's probably clear. Let's go.	Yes?
I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!	Beer!
Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's.	"You're the one the papers have been talking about. That mysterious ""Beer Baron"" who's been supplying Springfield with alcohol! How have you been getting away with this?"
Huh?	Homer, that's very clever!
It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!	Well, it is. I've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. Besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law...
No you won't.	You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron. And I'll find you.
Won't.	Yes, I will.
Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!	"Dateline: Springfield. The elusive Beer Baron continued to thumb his nose at authorities. Swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say: ""Look at me, Rex Banner. I have a new hat."""
Call me Beer Baron.	Uh, Dad...
But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!	All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business.
Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk...	Homer! My customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! You gotta get me more beer!
"""Make it,"" eh?"	Look, find it, buy it, make it, I don't care. Just get me some booze, and fast!
Forty-two bathtubs, please.	"""Make it,"" eh?"
I said forty-two!	You know, they're fifty for $3000 today.
Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots. Like... all those people in jail.	Now you're making your own alcohol? That's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?	Tubby? Oh, yes, Tubby!
Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner.	One of the stills --
Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear.	Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner.
What, dear?	Homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. Your homemade liquor is exploding again.
Ka-BLAMMO.	What, dear?
Boom.	You've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. Why not quit now, while you're ahead?
I'll be right back.	Boom.
It's hot!	I'll be right back.
I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit.	It's hot!
Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money.	I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit.
Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible.	Stick 'em up.
Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing.	Yeah, never mind how I look. You gonna give me the money or not?
Poor Wiggum.	Yeah, I had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. C'mon, give me the dough. I can throw this pretty hard.
I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?	Poor Wiggum.
The guy who took your job.	Um, who?
Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?	Oh, yeah... More than anything in the world!
You forgot one thing, Wiggum.	..then, the liquor-filled bowling balls travelled through a network of underground pipes, finally emerging at a nearby speakeasy.
I filled the balls with a funnel.	Yeah? What's that?
Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist...	That was a very sweet thing you did for poor Wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?
Last time I help you.	...And he who shall violate this law, shall be punished by catapult.
Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore.	On behalf of the city, I'd like to apologize, and ask how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again.
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!	And so, one town's brief flirtation with prohibition ended in a joyous remarriage to Lady Liquor! Congratulations, Springfield! We wish you the very best!
Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!	I said !
"Wooo, we're in orbit now! What's that? A call from the president? Hello?... Uh, yes. ""Let me just say this about that."" Okay, Mr. President..."	Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!
Mayday! Mayday!	Three and a half. We get beat up, but we get an explanation.
"Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is ""Krabappel?"" I've been calling her ""Crandall."" Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself."	Oh, my goodness.
Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house.	Homer, Bart's up there!
It was in... It was in my pocket.	Did you check your pocket?
Marge, mail's here.	Whoo!... Oh, Seymour...!
When? When? Ich bin hungrig!	"Ich esse	 er isst	 wir essen."
"Yes! My precious ""CarTOONS!"" ""Who pumped Ethyl?!"""	Homer, this is yours.
Marge, mail's here.	My name is... Santa's Little Helper.
Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!	And for Homer --
Oh, it smells like salmon, too! Thanks, boy!	Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not Santa's Little Helper.	And so handsome! Bart, I just love him!
Wow, I gotta start going to church.	Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes.
Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day.	What've you got for me, boy? Hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat.
Geez, that dog has more education than I do. He's some kinda super dog. Hey, where'd he go?	"""Some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."""
Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty.	Oh, it's against the house rule... Oh, I guess just this once.
Do you think he noticed?	Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie?
Who?	Where's Santa's Little Helper?
No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist his charms.	Well, we wrecked the first dog. We've got to treat this one right. Bart, why don't you take Laddie for another walk.
Crowds give him gas.	Ow.
Wow, TV's Kent Brockman.	Hey, that is one fine-looking animal you've got there.
You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?	Ha, ha. Hey, this fellow's not available to stud, is he?
I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable.	"""Time for a walk."" Again? We gotta find out where he's keeping these."
Can do.	Oh, Maggie, you got oatmeal all over. Homer, would you clean her off?
Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?	Can do.
Laddie?	Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?
He better know how to keep his mouth shut.	No. He just wasn't the right dog for me. I'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!	We can't. He's not in a kennel. I gave him away, too, and I don't know where he is.
There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog.	I'm sorry, I know it's wrong. I messed everything up and now I don't have any dogs at all.
Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!	I don't want a new dog. I want Santa's Little Helper.
Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.	I love this song.
The bad dog or the good dog?	I'm going to get the dog back.
Oh good.	The bad dog.
Marge!	Mom, Mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!
Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!	I could still use more paper.
Oh, okay.	Dad! You're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious.
Can Lenny have it?	Well, let's get out the old stock ticker and have a look...
Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.	Homer, you didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant.
Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale...	You found a candy bar?
No, the bank put Lenny in charge.	They're not going to close the plant, are they?
Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good.	Uhhh, attention everybody. Work harder. Bye!
Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today.	But I'm shopping!
Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!	There's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
You're welcome, honey.	Thanks, Dad!
You mean Maggie?	Sir, we've never met before, but my name is Mr. Burns and I want your daughter to help make me rich again.
Lisa! You have a guest!	Ah, the baby who shot me. No, I was referring to your other daughter.
So, um, how's life in the gutter?	Lisa! You have a guest!
See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?	"""Nothing evil."" That's exactly the kind of radical thinking I need! It's a deal."
It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.	Well, Lisa, as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent.
Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders...	"And from our ""It's Funny When It Happens To Them"" file... Remember millionaire C. Montgomery Burns? The man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy, and stole Christmas from 1981 to 1985? Well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living?"
Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey.	Wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking.
Uh-huh.	Lisa, nobody likes a gloater. Right, Homie?
Oh, I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone.	Oh, I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! I was a fool to help that horrible old man!
I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.	Simpson, what are you doing here? Why aren't you at work?
Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed.	Oh my goodness. Kids! Homer! We're late for church! I'm glad I dressed last night.
In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God.	Homer, the Lord only asks for an hour a week.
DAMMIT!!	...and the very same goes for Ezekiel, which brings us back to our starting point, the nine tenets of constancy.
Who cares? This is the best part of the week!	Hey, calm down. You're wrinkling your church clothes!
It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?	"""Barney Gumbel""."
Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.	The dump?
Wanna come with?	Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.
It's your life.	No, no, I don't feel like going to a trash pile today.
C'mon, Christmas tree.	I wasn't prepared for that.
Hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!	Okay. Who's up for some scrounging?
Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?	It looks Japanese.
Oh, my God, what is that?...	Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
Why would you volunteer at the church?	Yeah, shut up. I'm asking her.
"Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"	I don't know... guilt?
But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!	Homer! Will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? It came from the dump.
Akira, can you read this for me?	Hai!
Hokkaido, eh?	Yes. You have very lucky dishes, Mr. Simpson. This soap is from the sacred forest of Hokkaido. Renowned for its countless soap factories.
I'd like the phone book for Hokkaido, Japan, please.	And you never will be.
Thank you. May I please use your phone?	Okay. Here you go. The phone book for Hokkaido, Japan.
Y-y-y-yes.	Is it a local call?
Yes. This is Homer Simpson from America. Who may I say is speaking to me?	Moshi-moshi?
Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?	Hello Chief. Let's talk why not?
Well, I am Mr. Sparkle!	Oh, you like Mr. Sparkle?
Ow!	Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle Company in Japan!
Put it in! Put it in!	It's a videotape!
"That didn't explain anything. All I know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". There's no other explanation."	Bor-ing.
Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. C'mon kids. Let's go home.	Yep. There's your answer, Fish Bulb.
That was fast.	We are home.
Thanks for swinging by the house, Reverend.	Donny's discount gas!
Konichi-wa.	He... Mista Sparkaru! Mista Sparkaru!
No, run around in circles!	Play dead!
Now that's religion.	...Baboons to the left of me, baboons to the right, the speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs. A pair of the great apes rose up at me, but BIFF! BAM! I sent them flying like two hairy footballs. A third came screaming at me And that's when I got mad...
Can I have this one?	Any office supply company can have them made up for you.
Chair goes round... chair goes round.	Yes, sir.
Yes.	Hey, Homer, ya busy?
I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.	"Uh, maybe we oughta say ""Hi"" to him."
Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.	How do you do.
I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.	Oh, yeah. Carl and I each have a masters. 'Course old Homer, he didn't need a degree. He just showed up the day they opened the plant.
Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.	Um... Yeah... Well, listen, I'm... sure we all have a lot of work to do.
Oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.	Uh, I don't think we're being paid to sleep.
Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?	Looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.
Okay, Grimy!	My name is Grimes, uh, Simpson. Frank Grimes. I took the trouble to learn your name. The least you can do is learn mine.
Huh?	You're eating my special dietetic lunch.
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.	Huh?
Check.	The bag was clearly marked. Please be more careful in the future.
I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?	I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson.
Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.	Look at your control panel!
That got it.	Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.
Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!	You idiot! You nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid!
He did.	Who did this to my wall?
He likes you.	Come with me.
Hi, Grimy, old buddy.	But, Sir, if I could...
Okay. Do I have to do anything?	I'm not your buddy, Simpson. I don't like you. In fact, I hate you. Stay the hell away from me! Because from now on... we're enemies!
No, I won't accept that.	Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither.
Oh, what'll I do, Moe?	Okay, gimme that. Gimme it back!
Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?	Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye.
This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimy and me are going to be friends. Lisa -- be perfect.	There's always a first time.
Marge -- perfect. Bart -- perfect. Other kid -- perfect.	Okay.
No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here.	I only have five lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
It's him! It's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...	No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here.
Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.	Calm down, Homer. Calm down. Answer the door.
It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.	Yeah. What did you want to see me about, Simpson? This better be important.
This is my wife, Marge...	It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156.	Hello.
See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown.	Hi.
I 'unno. Don't ask me how the economy works.	How do you do. Look, Homer, I'm I'm late for my night job at the foundry, so if you don't mind telling m... Good heavens! Th-this is a palace. How can... how in the world can you afford to live in a house like this, Simpson?
Wow.	Yeah, but look at the size of this place. I-I-I live in a single room, above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley.
Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space.	I... I'm sorry, isn't that...?
Sure. You've never been?	You. Went into outer space. You.
Would you like to see my Grammy Award?	Sure. You've never been?
What?	No! I wouldn't Gaw, I've had to work hard every day of my life. And what do I have to show for it? This briefcase, and this haircut. And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?
What are you saying?	Everything! -- A dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife, a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes, and lobsters for dinner. And do you deserve any of it? No!
The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.	Homer, why aren't you at work?
Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road.	You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?
No he won't. He hates me.	You'll have to face him sometime. And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.
Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!	He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
I'll do it. To professionalism!	Just a little more... Then he won't have any reason to resent you.
Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson.	I'll do it. To professionalism!
Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am.	Oh, here we go.
Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I've gone home to work on the contest.	Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am.
Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?	I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand.
Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now...	Pipe down!
Hey, you okay, Grimy?	I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. D'oh d'oh d'oh!
You wish.	I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson.
Change the channel, Marge.	"Frank Grimes, or ""Grimy"" as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. And even though Frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, I'm sure he's looking down..."
Over there.	Well, golly, I'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. You haven't seen him, have you? Caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning hair?
Barney, where's my car?!!	Hey, I'm sweet. I'm sweeter than Jewish wine.
Ah, grrrreetings!	Then prove it. I want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.
Dad? Is that really you?	Son, it's me! I floated up toward heaven, but got lost along the way!
Call me when you get a karaoke machine.	Darn tootin', ya lousy fink! You buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! What kind of a son--
I'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.	Here he is!
B-b-before the show, you said we were having a Special Ghost tonight!	Ghost? What ghost?
Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?	You know Homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show.
Honey, I'm home!	Yes! And it might look something like this...
It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree, and I've nearly chewed through it. Now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight.	Honey, I'm home!
But, Marge...!	In a minute, Homie. I have to get the door.
Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and good.	Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?
No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy.	Christian love?
I WANT CANDY!	No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy.
I WANT CANDY!	Well, if you won't think of society's ills...
I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave so soon.	"Well, it's time to say ""good night."""
"Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying: ""As you walk down the road of life..."""	He's just kidding. We'd like to thank FOX, and the good people at Budget Lodge.
No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!	I know, I'll go to my room and think about what I did.
Not very.	You know, you do have options. For example, there are behavior modifying drugs. How wedded are you to the Bart you know?
"Well, I'm sorry if you heard ""Disneyland"", but I distinctly said ""military school."""	Military school?! You lied to me!
If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?	Freak-outs?
They sure are.	Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xian.
That's not so disciplined.	Ouch! Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
I guess.	They're just children, Mr. Simpson.
Leggo my leg.	Please don't make me stay, Dad! I'll do anything you say! I'll find religion! I'll be good sometimes!
Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school.	No!
Marge? You got that? Marge?!	I am just calling home, I am not asking to come home.
Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!	Marge? You got that? Marge?!
Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing.	Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!
Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?	The wars of the future will not be fought on a battlefield or at sea. They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain. In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. And as you go forth today, remember always, your duty is clear: to build and maintain those robots. Thank you.
Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence.	Well, he's got more confidence!
Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real!	For satisfactory completion of the second grade.
'Evening, Moe.	What a day. / Let's get started. / Some serious drinkin'. /
You got the black one.	NOOOOOOOOOO!
Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless!	You got the black one.
Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!	No, the Playboy Mansion! Playboy Mansion!
Goodnight, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. Just slide it under the door.	Oh, that's just drunk talk. Sweet, beautiful drunk talk...
So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school.	All I remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at Villanova. Or maybe it was a streetcorner.
Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts.	Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself.
Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City!	Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York!
My vehicle!	"""Dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan..."""
Oh, I don't want to go to New York City.	"""...If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense."""
New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes.	Why not?
It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.	Yeah! That's what people do in Russia!
All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station...	It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.
Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life.	All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station...
And that's when the CHUDs came at me.	Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life.
Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!	Great! We're all going to New York!
Don't you start.	Dad, our baby pictures were in there!
Marge, I can't feel my legs!	I just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
I can't feel my legs!	Marge, I can't feel my legs!
Oh. Hi.	Homer! Homer, those legs belong to the man behind you.
Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks.	Eh, maybe a little.
Good. I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car.	Homer, you're scaring the children.
Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.	The bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. We'll meet you in Central Park at five o'clock.
I'm on to you!	Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.
"""Your vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza."" Hmmm..."	I'm on to you!
Ooohh...	"""Your vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza."" Hmmm..."
Come off! Come off! Oh, all right, you!	Stupid city! What the hell is this thing?
Ow.	Come off! Come off! Oh, all right, you!
They expect me to sit here from nine to five?! That's how many hours? Ten, eleven, denominator... Oh, where's Lisa when you need her?	-- GRABOWSKI.
Come on! Pick up the pace!	I'm in over my head here. Thank you for your time.
Hey! I'm not a bum... Thanks, but I don't need... Okay, if you insist, but... Spare change, lady? Lousy cheapskate...	Come on! Pick up the pace!
So hungry... can't leave car... Huh...	Hey! I'm not a bum... Thanks, but I don't need... Okay, if you insist, but... Spare change, lady? Lousy cheapskate...
Getting closer... closer...almost there... Ow!	So hungry... can't leave car... Huh...
Hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?	Fresh Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!
Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl.	No pizza. Only Khlav Kalash.
Geez! That's just... awful!	No bowl -- stick. Stick.
Mmmm. Now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?	Geez! That's just... awful!
Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.	Mountain Dew or crab juice.
Uh-oh. Uhh... You got a men's room in there?	Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.
But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?	Only Khlav Kalash. Men's room in tower -- tower! Observation deck.
Mmmmm.	But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?
Come on, boot guy!	Oh, no!! Chinese Fire Drill! Serious this time!!
Flushing Meadows...	Come on, boot guy!
Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second.	Flushing Meadows...
Frontsies... Backsies... I'm with them... V.I.P... Coming through... Very important person... They gave me frontsies...	Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second.
Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!	"What? ""Failure to wait by vehicle: $250."""
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!	Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!
It's gonna be dark soon. I'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.	Uh, seriously, though -- my name is Bart Simpson. My father has a subscription. I'd like the grand tour, please.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!	Yeah, ya jackass!
Aha! I've got it! Brain, how can I ever thank you?	Shhh! They're strapping down Liza Minelli.
Sorry.	Aha! I've got it! Brain, how can I ever thank you?
Just a minute... Everything's under control... Yes, I'd be upset, too...	Sorry.
Hey! Hey! Hey!	Just a minute... Everything's under control... Yes, I'd be upset, too...
The boss says you're fired.	What?!
Come o-o-on! Come o-o-on!	So long, Mr. Boot.
Die! Die!	Come o-o-on! Come o-o-on!
Homer one, New York nothing.	Die! Die!
Ow!	My God, that maniac is heading straight for us! Go Secretariat! Go!
We're getting outta here, now! Jump in, Marge! Trust me! Throw the kids! No time for the baby!	Hey, it's Dad! Right on time!
Come on! Let's go! Everyone into the car! Now!	We're not jumping, Homer.
We'll see, honey.	What a magical city! Can we come back next year, Dad?
We'll see.	We'll see, honey.
Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm...	Let's bake him a cake.
Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.	I have no son!
"Or ""crapweeds""."	"Not if you called 'em ""stench blossoms""."
"Not if they were called ""scumdrops""."	I'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for Valentine's Day. I'd rather have candy.
Fair enough.	Ah, 433rd Street, my old neighborhood...
Okay, once more. Where are we going?	Did you ever tell him that?
And why are you and the old lady in the car?	To Capitol City.
And why is Marge here?	We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian into coming back.
And why am I here?	I came up with the idea.
And why are the kids here?	Because the streets of Capitol City are no place for three unescorted ladies.
And why is Grampa here?	Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.
"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?"	"And I'm not Seymour! My name is Armin! This is Armin's apartment! Armin's liquor! Armin's copy of ""Swank""! Armin's frozen peas!"
Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!	Yes, Mrs. Skinner.
All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?	Now hold on. Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps.
Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity.	Well, I don't see any way out of this.
And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.	But I'm a hero!
Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?	Well this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.
BOY THE WAY THE BEE GEES PLAYED...	Yes, Mother.
GUESSING HOW MUCH ELVIS WEIGHED...	MOVIES JOHN TRAVOLTA MADE...
WATCHING SHOWS LIKE GENTLE BEN...	AND YOU KNEW WHERE YOU WERE THEN...
MISTER, WE COULD USE A MAN LIKE SHERIFF LOBO AGAIN.	WATCHING SHOWS LIKE GENTLE BEN...
DISCO DUCK AND FLEETWOOD MAC...	MISTER, WE COULD USE A MAN LIKE SHERIFF LOBO AGAIN.
Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'?	The Simpsons is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
What a bad father.	Whoever you are, just pass it along, kid.
Lisa, knock off that racket!	What a bad father.
I'll practice you!	But Dad, I'm supposed to practice an hour a day!
Bart, make her stop.	You'll practice me? What does that mean? Is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad.	Haw haw!
Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves.	Oh yeah?
Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves.	Hey!
You don't remember how you got it?	Dad, you don't understand. This saxophone is like my oldest friend. I've had it for as long as I can remember.
Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school...	Nuh-uh.
Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me...	Oh, honey, I can't right now. Bart's gonna be late!
Lousy traumatic childhood.	Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. If a strange man offers you a ride, I say take it!
BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...	Hi honey! How was your first day of school? Honey?
And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school.	THOSE WERE THE DAYYYYYS.
Yeah.	Very nice.
No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!	Homer, I can't get the baby to burp. Could you try for a while?
Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree.	Homer!
And we never did.	Let's never drink again.
Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.	That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks. And damn good cherry pie.
Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!	Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did.
Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell!	Homer stop! Would you please look at the drawing?
Get it away!	I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.
Bart, son. You wanna play catch?	Get it away!
When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong.	No.
Get the hell out.	I'll play catch with you, son.
Wait a minute... she's right!	Two apples!
Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future.	That's wonderful! But still, can't you do anything for Bart?
Wow. Just think of the possibilities.	That's right, honey. If you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do.
Nah.	Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize.
Hm.	Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize for Kickboxing.
Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her.	I can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality. Over seventy-five per cent of our graduates go on to first grade.
I'll give ya fifty bucks.	Very good. Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition check, she's in.
Seventy-five.	Our fee is non-negotiable.
Excellente! Muchas gracias, Señorata!	Sorry. I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group.
Ah so.	Sorry.
Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste.	Come on, honey. I guess this is a world you'll never know.
You do that.	And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to scream till my lungs explode! Uh... I'll go start dinner now.
Dad, what are you doin' here?	Hello!
Ohhh. So hottt.	And so, Springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava.
Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?	Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday...
You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next?	Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?
Unless what?	I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless...
Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky.	Well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner.
Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning.	I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.	Balzac!
"Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?"	But Balzac is the name--
All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner...	Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa.
Mmmm... re-circulated air.	All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner...
What, Flanders.	Uh... Homer?
"Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""	Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?
Well, Moe, this is it. Today's the day I get my new air conditioner.	My fifteen minutes of fame are over.
She has a gift.	I'm Lisa!
Oooh.	Uh... here, have a margarita.
A musical instrument? Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? Just give me a sign!	Wowww...
Eh, works for me.	A musical instrument? Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? Just give me a sign!
So what do you like, Lisa? Viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?	Eh, works for me.
Ohh! Saxomophone.	That one!
Two hundred dollars!	Ohh! Saxomophone.
Oh, I'll take it.	Two hundred dollars!
"Yeah. ""To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."""	Would you like an inscription, sir?
...and that inscription is still there today.	"Yeah. ""To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."""
Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier.	Wow. So that's how Lisa got her sax.
Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?	You know, Homer... I think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?
Will you get off my front lawn?	Don't forget the smell!
Why -- oh, I give up.	Why don't you make me?
I learned from the master.	You're a good father.
Stupid hippo.	...and that's how an heroic hippo became a deputy.
Stupid frog.	"This just in: tensions continue to mount between Springfield and France over Mayor Quimby's now famous ""frog's legs"" joke. The French President has threatened swift and massive retaliation if he doesn't receive an immediate apology."
Relax, I built a bomb shelter.	Homer, you know how unpredictable the French are. One minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. What if they start a war?
Fine, then don't use it.	That's not gonna protect us from anything.
Good.	I won't.
So do I.	I know it's good.
You should be.	I'm happy for you.
You call that prime rib?	Oh, I've wasted my life.
It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo? Maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass.	You call that prime rib?
Heh, still got it...	It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo? Maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass.
Geez, what's with all the death?	Heh, still got it...
Oh my God. Everyone's gone! Little Bart...	Geez, what's with all the death?
Little Lisa-a-a...	Oh my God. Everyone's gone! Little Bart...
Little Marge...	Little Lisa-a-a...
And the rest.	Little Marge...
Oh, I've lost everything. I can't go on. No, no, no! I can't just wallow in sadness. It's time to laugh again. I'm the last man alive!	And the rest.
And I can do everything I've always wanted!	Oh, I've lost everything. I can't go on. No, no, no! I can't just wallow in sadness. It's time to laugh again. I'm the last man alive!
Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front.	And I can do everything I've always wanted!
"""War! Hunh! Good God y'all! / What is it good for? / Absolutely nothin'! Say it again!"" Okay!"	Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front.
Hey, what happened to the tunes?	"""War! Hunh! Good God y'all! / What is it good for? / Absolutely nothin'! Say it again!"" Okay!"
Hey, what the hell's goin' on? Where'd you get those cloaks?	Hey, what happened to the tunes?
You're mutants?	Not everyone died in the blast, Homer. Some of us were merely horribly mutated.
You want me? Come and get me!!	And now you must die.
Die, you chalk-faced goons!	A c... a coffin!
Go to hell, cloaky!	Come on, we just wanna eat your skin!
Safe at last.	Go to hell, cloaky!
That better not be the mutants.	Safe at last.
Marge! Kids! You're alive!	Homie, is that you?
Ohh, com'ere.	All the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
Now that's the Marge I married.	Friends with mutants, right.
So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?	Now that's the Marge I married.
Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone.	Yo! / Yayyy! I do! / I do! / Right here! / Yay! / I do! / Let's go!
He's crazy.	Good morning, ma'am. Good afternoon, sir. It passed noon while I was speaking, so that was technically accurate.
Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matter? Umm... Well, ah... I'll give you 35 cents.	I take it from that little impressed noise that you are interested in purchasing that matter transporter, sir.
I said I'll take it.	Sold! But I must warn you, this device carries a frighteningly high risk of catastrophic...
This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. But not any more, baby!	I said I'll take it.
Good night, losers!	This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. But not any more, baby!
Man, how'd I live without this thing?	Good night, losers!
Oh, man that's good.	Man, how'd I live without this thing?
Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!	Hey Dad, can I use the transporter sometime? Please, I swear I'll be careful.
It was your mother.	Ow! Someone just punched me in the face!
"Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"	Oh! Ow! Uh!
I think she's right. The pants are a dead giveaway.	Bluggh? Blarrr! Blagh!
"So then Lenny says, ""As if! Don't even go there, sister."""	Homer, stop that!
Yeah, well Lenny said it.	Good one, Dad.
Eh, it'll turn up somewhere.	There's one thing I still don't understand. When Bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?
Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart.	Sucker!
Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!	BLARRGH!
Nice work, son.	Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!
Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.	Mom, Dad, help! He's trying to kill me!
Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with.	Hey! It worked!
Something I should have done a long time ago.	Homer, what are you doing?
I'll teach you to mess with my machine!	Something I should have done a long time ago.
I'm gonna chop you good!	I'll teach you to mess with my machine!
That cost me 35 cents!	I'm gonna chop you good!
You're just making it worse. I promise I won't hurt you.	That cost me 35 cents!
That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.	If they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?
Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.	Let us throw open the floor to, ah, wild accusations.
They're in my hair! They're in my hair!	As for the rest of you...
C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!	Yar... and that's the story of the very first caramel cod. I mean, Halloween. And it wasn't long before this yearly custom became an annual tradition.
She's a witch!	Dad, that's our house.
I don't know.	Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?
Oh, I've never heard of those people.	You'll see all your favorite soccer stars like: Ariaga! Ariaga II! Bariaga! Aruglia! And Pizzoza!
Woo hoo!	And they'll all be signin' autographs.
Yes, yes, oh God yes!	Can we go, Dad? / Please Dad? / Please, please, please? / Can we go, huh, huh please? /
Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.	Yes, yes, oh God yes!
Bo-ring!	Pelé is king of the soccer field. To be king of your kitchen, use Crestfield wax paper.
Oh, but I want to do some rioting.	Homer. We gotta get out of here.
All done.	Jobbers cobknots ya mucker!
I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please.	All done.
Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know.	Oh my God, Homer! They're right next door!
What did I tell you, Marge?	Looks like you called me ju-uust in time. This home isn't secure at all.
Oh, let's get that.	Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good but doesn't provide any real protection.
Let's get that! The suffocation thing!	Well, I should hope not!
Five hundred dollars! Forget it.	And you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.
I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.	But surely you can't put a price on your family's lives.
I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have.	Homer, we need something to protect this family.
I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.	Whoa, careful there, Annie Oakley.
Oh, yeah.	Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit: holster...
Baby.	Bandoleer...
Mmm-hmm.	Silencer...
Ahh.	Loudener...
Ooo, I like the sound of that.	Speed-cocker...
Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun.	And this is for shooting down police helicopters.
Five days! But I'm mad now!	Sorry, the law requires a five day waiting period. We've got to run a background check.
Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.	Yeah, well, you don't.
Well, if he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two.	Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
Let's see what happens when he walks into my store. Then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...	Well, if he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two.
Marge kicked me out.	Dad! It's three A.M.! Can't you mutter in your room?
Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children.	All right. Go ahead.
How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?	Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children.
Come on, come on, open up!	How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?
Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me.	Come on, come on, open up!
Yuh.	Well, let's see here, uh, according to your background check, you've been in a mental institution...
Yeah.	Frequent problems with alcohol...
Former President.	You beat up President Bush.
Potentially dangerous?	Former President.
Woo hoo!	Relax, that just limits you to three handguns or less.
Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for you.	Woo hoo!
I thought Smithers did it.	Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?
Only if you clean your room.	Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I want to scare that old security guard at the bank.
TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.	No! No one's using this gun. The TV said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder.
You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?	Dad! The 2nd Amendment is just a remnant from Revolutionary days. It has no meaning today.
All right, then.	No...
A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more.	I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons.
Pull!	No, thanks!
Learnin' somethin', Marge?	Assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super-animals, such as the flying squirrel and the electric eel.
Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!	Hi, Homer.
Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair.	Homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts.
What? Oh Apu, I would never...	Oh, don't shoot. Just take the money and get out.
Or would I?	What? Oh Apu, I would never...
I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.	Or would I?
All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it next time.	I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.
Sure thing, honey.	Can you help me get my ball down from the roof, Dad?
You want me to get the cat down?	Sure thing, honey.
See you in hell, dinner plate.	Missed one, Dad.
Mmm, you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get-together?	Uhmm...
You said the breakfast table.	Homer, I told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table.
Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on.	It's the same table!
Oops, guess it already was on.	Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on.
Uh. I'd better just put it down.	Oops, guess it already was on.
All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you.	But this is the first time since we've been married that I've actually feared for our lives. So I'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun.
And I'm a wonderful man.	I'm a lucky woman.
Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.	Bart!
I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?	You lied to me! You promised to get rid of this gun!
But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!	How could you?! Of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable...
So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!	Until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. Come on, kids.
Do you know how to cook dinner?	So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!
Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!	Hey, this TV's not broken, it's just unplugged! What the...
They're here! They're here!	Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!
Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.	And that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns.
Anyone else want a beer?	Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.
I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.	Homer! You use your gun as a can opener?
Yeah, but...	Are you some kind of moron?
I didn't get one yet.	I'll also need to remove your tattoo.
This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun.	Come on, Smelly!
This stinks. I want my family back.	This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun.
Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?	All right. Vote Quimby.
Sorry.	Vote Quimby.
Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!	Down here, Homer.
O-kay!	Come down here.
Oh-ho, confused, would we?	O-kay!
Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome. And there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks.	Oh-ho, confused, would we?
It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?	What about the gun?
Freeze, bad guy!	Do what he says. I'm too rich to die.
I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was...	Homer! You said you got rid of the gun. You lied to me! Again!
The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing.	Yoink!
Okay, don't shoot!	Yo, give me the bullets.
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!	No, I don't think so.
Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!	Well, your cholesterol level is lethally high, Homer. But I'm more concerned about your gravy level.
You're a disgrace to this family.	I'm comfortable with who I am.
There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches.	Or good old-fashioned Pee Wee Football!
Then it's settled.	Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt.
Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had.	The Wildcats!
Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot.	He's the only coach this team has ever had. And the season hasn't even started yet.
Fun, too.	You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize.
Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!	Ooo, he's quite a little dancer.
Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times.	Yayyy! / I'm special! / Wooo! / Etc.
Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason...	What a rip!!
Yes, Roy.	Sir, if I could just break in for a moment...
Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?	Do you have a question for Sandy Koufax?
Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?	Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?
Flaaaan-ders... Flaaaan-ders...	Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?
Flaaaan-ders...	What?
Game's out there! Made you look...	What?! What is it?!
I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh.	Dad, that was really mean.
Hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, Flanders. Go Wildcats!	I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh.
No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you.	Do you have a problem with the way I'm coaching?
Me? But you were doing such a great job.	Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!
Then why are you running the obstacle course?	I don't want to make the team.
You never use it.	Are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
Wipe that smile off your face.	Good morning, everybody.
I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps.	What did I do?
Do it.	Oh, man.
Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it.	You shouldn't pressure Bart like that.
I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?	Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it.
My father never believed in me.	That's what I get for having faith in ya.
Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad.	My father never believed in me.
Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!	Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad.
I believe in you! Hug meeeee!	Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!
Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!	I believe in you! Hug meeeee!
Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts.	Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!
Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you.	Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts.
Congratulations, the rest of you made the team.	Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you.
Except you, you and you.	Congratulations, the rest of you made the team.
"Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me ""Coach"" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"	Bart didn't get cut. What a surprise...
What is it, sweetie?	But, Coach?
Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut.	Yeah. / Yeah, he's right. / He's good.
Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you.	But I can't play quarterback. I don't even know how.
Since your mother yelled at me. Now how 'bout that hug?	Since when?
Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?	Good luck, Homer. No hard feelin's.
It's okay, son. You'll do better next time.	Yahh!
Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you didn't lose your cool.	Look at him go!
Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters.	Aw, crap.
Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?	Are you kidding? I reeked!
Hey, everybody! Let's hear it for Bart!	Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?
Ah, you guys are some k...	Good.
Ohh, your Mother's not pregnant, is she?	Dad, I've got some bad news.
Ohh, boy. Well, I'll just have to go to my back up plan... Nelson, how's your arm feelin'?	No, I got hit by a couple of cars. I won't be able to play today.
Good, take this note over to the referee.	Great!
Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart. He's the heart of this team!	Forfeit? / What? / Come on! / Oh, man.
Don't listen to them, son. I have total faith in you.	Yeah, he does. / And how.
What? Well, I got news for you, Mister. You can't quit! You're cut! You too, Milhouse.	You don't get it, do you? I don't want to be your stupid quarterback! I quit!
Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too.	May I be excused, Mom?
I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler...	Homer, please.
Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job.	He's doing what he thinks is best...
Mr. Burns, this is Homer J. Simpson, the father of the big quitter. Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big quitter, too, and I quit!	Ahoy-hoy-hoy?
So...	Homer, Mr. Burns can't see you winking.
We're in the championship. Way to go, team!	We drove 2000 miles for this?
Well, Bart, looks like it's just you and... Ohhh.	Aw, I don't wanna bother Mom at work.
"I'm feelin' kinda low, Apu. You got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? You know, ""Skittlebrau""?"	I'll scratch you. The hair. The hair. Slut. Loser. Skag. Skag. Skag.
Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles.	Such a product does not exist, sir. I think you must have dreamed it.
Hello, son.	Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles.
I wanna apologize. I just got so caught up trying to encourage you, I was blinded to your stinky performance. If you forgive me, I promise I'll never encourage you again.	Hello, son.
I've got lots of quarters.	I wanna apologize. I just got so caught up trying to encourage you, I was blinded to your stinky performance. If you forgive me, I promise I'll never encourage you again.
Aww... You know, tomorrow's the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle.	This thing only takes dollars.
Consider him cut.	But I thought Uter took my place.
Hold on, I'm workin' it out.	Time for one last play, coach.
Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, Nelson, you just spin around in a circle.	Hold on, I'm workin' it out.
Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?	All right, I've got an arrest warrant here for a Nelson Muntz. Uh, which one of you little punks is Muntz?
Are you sure, son?	It's okay Dad, I can fill in for Nelson.
I knew I could count on you.	Are you sure, son?
Scully, you're cut. Ehhh, Brooks, Groening, Simon, you're all cut. Castellaneta, gone. Kavner, cut. Cartwright, cut. Smith, sorry, cut. Azaria and Shearer, you're cut. Firestone, you're cut. So is Judge. Namath, you stay. All of those people are cut. Phil, Schultz and Wolf and Silverman. Goldreyer, O'Brien, Dolye, Selman. I don't know what... I don't know what you're doin' here, 'cause you're all cut. Pietila, Clan..., Kuwahaha... There're so many cuts here look, I'll just post 'em up and you just see where your name is. Oooo, look at how many cuts there are there. Ohhh, boy, you're cut. All of you. He's cut, I cut you! You're cut too, Shooshie!	Poor Bart... You know we had a lot of fun tonight, but there's nothing funny about... vapor lock. It's the third most common cause of car stallings. So please, take care of your car and get it checked. I'm Joe Namath. Goodnight.
Yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?	Lazy bums.
I understand. Yoink. Wow...	"""This is just a note to say, I think about you every day. And when I get you all alone..."" Well, it gets a little bit personal, here."
Whoa...	I know.
Ooo, let's see what she wrote!	Oh, here's one from my mother.
Oh. Well, congratulations.	No, no. It is the sign that it is time for my arranged marriage!
Not... really...	No, no, no. Don't you know what it means?
O-kay, here we go...	It all happened shortly after my eighth birthday...
Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.	Oh, I cannot get married. I'm just beginning to enjoy my bachelorhood. Ah, what am I going to do?!
Then just tell her you're already married.	No, no, no, no, you do not know Mother. She will never quit until I am married.
Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!	No, no. I cannot lie to my mother.
Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.	It worked! It worked! The lie has set me free!!
I have this much.	Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.
Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.	I am sorry, you do not have enough for both.
Late night, huh?	Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.
You dog.	I'm not the type to kiss and tell, sir, but listen to this...
What's the big problem?	Oh, no! Oh, no! What am I going to do?!
Then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.	The wife that I told her I had. I do not have a wife.
Okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um...	Oh, yes, that'll buy me some time. Homer, you've got to help me!
Wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that Marge is your wife.	What?! What?! What?! What?! What?!
It's you.	Is it me, or do your plans always involve some horrible web of lies?
Oh, that Yodel was so good. I wish I was eatin' it right now.	And go we shall, because it is in the going that we at-tat-tat-tat-tat!
Oh, crap, I forgot!	Oh, that Yodel was so good. I wish I was eatin' it right now.
Marge, I need a small favor. For the next few days, will you pretend to be Apu's wife?	Oh, crap, I forgot!
Please? It's just for as long as his mother's living here.	What?!
Can you feel the love?	How was your day, sweetheart?
Okay, gotta run. Apu, I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again.	Ohhhh. Here I am!
Oh, right. With the giant heads.	Ah, sorry Homer, I've been planning this vacation for years. I'm finally gonna see Easter Island.
Hey, Dad. I've come to spend some time with my favorite father.	With the what now?
You're already in a home.	Baloney. You came here to put me in a home.
Oh, no, I'm not... Oh, well, let's see whatcha got here.	Abraham Simpson. Cornelius Talmadge.
Supper at 4 o'clock? Oh-ho, what a sweet deal!	All right, folks, it's supper time.
Hey! They got chairs with wheels, and here I am using my legs like a sucker!	Supper at 4 o'clock? Oh-ho, what a sweet deal!
Jasper. Gladys. Beatrice. Lookin' good, Hattie. Asa. Hazel. Hazel! Hazel!	Fully. We have to go now.
Oh, the hell with her. Hester. Emil. Prudence. Lemuel. Increase. Dad.	Jasper. Gladys. Beatrice. Lookin' good, Hattie. Asa. Hazel. Hazel! Hazel!
Oh, no you don't.	Supper time!
Eat my dust!	Oh, yes I do.
Damn right.	Wow, someone sure likes his kidney mush.
Mmm. Who knew that Lay's made liquid potato chips? I can't suck just one.	Damn right.
Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?	Another bag of chips, Mr. Talmadge?
Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?	Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?
And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?	A respirator. It breathes for him.
Yeah!	You mean there?
When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it.	Wait a minute, if you're Cornelius Talmadge, then who's...?
Ohhh, right, right. The fake marriage thing. How's that goin'?	Well, I'm glad you were having fun, because I've had my hands full with Apu's mother.
Lied to his mother.	Mother, I am so sorry. I lied to you about being married.
You could fake your own death...	Yeah, shut up.
All you need is a car bomb and...	Oh, would you shut up.
Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?	To Marge!
Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven.	Well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left...
C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.	"""WELL, I'M HOT BLOODED / CHECK IT AND SEE / I'VE GOT A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE..."""
You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.	C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
Ahh. Is this the life, or what?	You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.
Nah, just your screwy country.	Can you believe it? Tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman I am about to spend my life with. Hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?
Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love.	Your old friend Apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.
Gods, eh?	Oof, I am really doomed. Only the gods could stop this wedding now.
Screw him.	Dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant.
Put me down! Ganesh commands you! Oh-ho-ho-ho!	Screw him.
Come on, elephant. Put me down! Hey, everyone seems upside down.	Got you.
"""Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..."" Da-da-da-da-da."	Yeah, good work, Eddie.
That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.	But we didn't enter any police raffle.
Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.	I don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
I'd like a yellow boat, please. With extra motors.	Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
Woo hoo!	All right, uh, Simpson, Homer. You're next.
Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--	Woo hoo!
OW! OW! My boating arm! What's going on?	Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--
Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?	Ha, I hope you brought your checkbook, wise guy.
I didn't like it. The mast had termites.	Dad? Why aren't you saying anything? Where's our motorboat?
Because... the thingee was... shut up.	Why would a motorboat have a mast?
Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.	Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!
Lemme through! I got here late!	What is it? / What? / That's unbelievable. / Oh, this is nice. / Wow.
Now that's interesting.	Lisa's right! It's an angel!
So long, suckers!	Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--
Come on... Come on, Angel.	So long, suckers!
I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.	What are you doing with that?
I'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.	I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants.	It's probably a million years old, Dad. I think it's as valuable as it's gonna get.
Ahh. We elected the wrong Carter.	Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants.
Sounds like goood watchin'.	"Coming up next... an hilarious ""boat giveaway"" scam nets Springfield's dumbest criminals!"
Get your own angel, ya moocher.	Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you.
Hey, I'm trying to eat here. Beat it, Pegleg!	Sorry to trouble you, but I'm goin' in for surgery tomorrow, and I wondered if I could rub the angel with my foot for good luck. It's foot surgery.
A buck, eh? That gives me an idea...	C'mon, Homer. I just want a quick look-see. Pay ya a buck...
Fifty cents, please.	A buck, eh? That gives me an idea...
HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!	Ahh, here's Dr. Gould now. What were the results, Professor?
"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel""."	Dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. There's no proof of that.
That's a typo.	What about that sign right there?
Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya.	Just let me take it to the museum for one day. They can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.	You did what? / Analysis? / I don't like her.
Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!	Good. Stay there.
Somebody stop her!	Hey, she's gonna smash the angel!
Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?	It's gone...
You damn well better!	I could take up smoking.
Okay, okay, don't panic. Marge, stop panicking. We need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. Bart! Strip down to your skeleton!	You damn well better!
Look! A message!	Well, it didn't ride up on no zebra.
"""The end will come at sundown."" Heh heh heh heh. Hey, wait a second. I don't like the sound of that."	Look! A message!
Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan.	Hardly. Anyone could have written that.
Oh, Marge, don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too.	Uhm, nah.
Ahh, I love these lazy Saturdays.	Any time, my angel.
Work!	It's Wednesday, Homer.
Ahh, I love these real Saturdays. They're so relaxing. Not like that fake Saturday that almost got me fired.	Work!
Absolutely.	Is this all we're going to do today?
It is?	You know, Homer, I'm starting to realize life is short.
We do?	We have to make the most of the time we have.
Oh, that.	Otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives.
Ah.	Oh, that.
Pfft. Friends of the library?	Friends of the Library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
I went yesterday.	Ooo... Oo! There's an Azalea festival at the public garden!
Open a window.	I'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!
Can you believe it? It's already been a year.	Allll right, I hear ya, honey. Change into something nice. We're steppin' out!
Wow, sweetheart. Look at all this seized booty. We could find the drug boat of our dreams!	Can you believe it? It's already been a year.
Well, I bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!	I don't want a drug boat.
Woo hoo!	Sold!
I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.	You bought a car?! Without consulting me?!
Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.	I found this hat!
Oh, yeah. You've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this....	Homer, be careful...
You're the boss.	Stop, Homer! Stop it! Let me out!
Okay-bye-love-you.	I'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert.	Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gear-head, Homer.
You betcha.	What is that? A six-barrel Hollye carb?
Nothin' but.	Edelbrock intakes...
Oh yeah.	Meyerhof lifters...
I see.	I made that last one up.
I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step toward failure.	Selling real estate could be just what I'm looking for. I'd really like to give it a try.
You're all nuts.	They back your baaaannk!
What about me? You didn't thank me.	Oh, thank you Bart, thank you Lisa, for all your help!
I like being thanked.	You didn't do anything.
Seat belts?! Pfft! They kill more people than they save.	Ah! Dad! Doesn't this car have seat belts?
Gee, that picture makes your butt look big.	Wow! / Your own billboard! / Check it out!
Lumber. We need lumber.	Works for the Lumber King.
Come on! It'll be fun!	My high school sweetheart was killed in a drag racing accident.
Come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...	That's what Debbie Sue said...
Lousy doormat.	Because cubicles are for closers, Marge. Anybody who doesn't sell a house their first week gets fired. I probably should have mentioned that earlier.
Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother.	Ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. Big deal.
Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace?	Well, I can too compete. And I'm going to sell a house. End of story.
Man, the air feels good on my neck!	Ho-ho. Okay. Baldy boy hits wire, head comes off, Li'l Bandit rolls to a gentle stop. Everybody wins.
Ooo, gumball.	Man, the air feels good on my neck!
Wow, honey, you sold a house and got rid of the Flanders. What's for dinner?	Oww!
Yeah, me too. Let me know if you need any help.	Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby.
It was just an expression.	Uh, now that you mention it, we could use...
That old Flanders place gives me the creeps.	So long! / Good-bye! / Good luck!
"""MY NAME IS LUKA, / I LIVE ON THE SECOND FLOOR..."""	That old Flanders place gives me the creeps.
This is my car! And I'm not fat, it's glandular!	Gimme my car, fatty.
Stop it!	Well, I'm just glad you're okay. And I have something to tell you...
You're...	Ow!
...going...	Ow!
...down...	Ow!
...punk!	Ow!
Yeah, you're right.	Whoa! This is sooo dangerous.
Oh. Oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap.	Uh, Marge? Still got that deposit check?
Oh, you will, honey. You will.	Still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck.
Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there!	Don't worry. Gets easier every week.
You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle.	Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve to do your shopping? The crowds are just beastly.
Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve.	Homer! Look at this mob! The good toys are probably all gone.
Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience.	Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve.
Sorry, these are for display only... This has been recalled... Oo, Bart would like this... We're out of these...	Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience.
Register 9 is now closed.	Out?! But I just --
What the-- Where's Christmas? Lisa, where's Christmas?	What happened?
Can - we - skip - church?	I know...
Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us.	What? You can't rule it out.
Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy.	Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks? That'll make us feel better.
Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis.	Looks like the Flanders are having a nice Christmas.
That's not as fun as it looks.	Merry Christmas, Simpsons!
Lisa, you promised they'd be miserable. What the hell's goin' on?!	Homer!
Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe.	Sounds like you're having a rough Christmas, Homer. You know what I blame this on the breakdown of? Society.
You take that back, Barney!	Homer, look! Your house is on TV!
Stay out of this, old man.	Nah, he's right, Homer.
Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie.	No. My husband is... at church.
You shut up.	Yeah, she's quite a gal.
Oh, Marge, I don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish.	Homer! You won't believe what's happened! It's a miracle!
Wow, this really restores your faith in...	Does anyone have change for a button?
Lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!	Wow, this really restores your faith in...
Thanks, Ted.	Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours.
Marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!	Hey, speak for yourself.
Is this car $15,000?	God bless you, Bart Simpson. I'd kiss you, but doctor says I'm sick.
What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.	It is now. And because of your loss, folks, I'll throw in the undercoating for two hundred -- nooo, four hundred and ninety bucks.
Outta my way, snow-poke!	Will this Christmas never end?
Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm --	Slow down, Homer.
Oopsie.	Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm --
Shut up! One at a time! Lisa?	Hit the brakes! / Floor it! / Stop! / To the left! / Head back!
I knew this would happen.	That was close.
Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak!	Why you little...
I'm gonna kill you! / No, I'm killing him first! / Why you little... Bart, the next time you ever have... / You went too far...	Stop that!
"Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."""	Folks, any words for the Christmas thief, if he's watching?
Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!	Little Lisa's sweater? Little Homer's sausage?! What in the name of holy hell is going on here?
Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report.	So the family never knew about any of this.
Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh?	Ha.
Run for your lives, everyone! This is not a drill!	Hi, liar.
Oh great, now we have to send him a card.	"""...You'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. Sincerely, Moe."""
There's only one way out. We've gotta give this greedy town its money back.	I know you're used to getting hate mail, but I'm not.
Oh no, there's that angry mob again.	There's no shame in being a pariah.
What the hell's goin' on?	If you're headin' for the medicine cabinet, I already been there.
Maybe so. But there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth.	Yeah. Plus lots of other stuff.
The hell it is!	Hey, that's my washcloth.
Gimme that! / Uh, gimme that! / No! / Let go! / Gimme that my washcloth! / I want it!	The hell it is!
Hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!	Besides, it's mine. Yoink!
Go!	She's going around the other side. Now get her!
Oh, I got it! Oh, it's just a thread! It was... She's got... she's got the washcloth!	Go!
"Well, they put us on the ""Waiting to Exhale Waiting List."" But they said don't hold your breath."	"We got the popcorn! Did you get ""Waiting To Exhale?"""
Whoa. Whoa. Calm down, little lady--Take it easy--Take it easy. No.	"Did you get ""Emma?"" Did you get ""Emma?"" Did ya? Did ya? Did ya? Huh?"
Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western!	What did you get?
With blood, I bet!	"So prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of Joshua Logan's, ""Paint Your Wagon!"""
They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other?	THEY'RE GONNA PAINT THAT WAGON / THEY'RE GONNA PAINT IT GOOD / THEY AIN'T BRAGGIN' / THEY'RE GONNA COAT THAT WOOD.
Wait, wait, wait. Here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk and violent.	Yeah, their guns are right there!
Bart!	He's dreamy.
Ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing?	Bart!
Singing is the lowest form of communication.	I thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
No I don't, I hate to rhyme.	Homer, you sing all the time!
NO I DON'T, I THINK THEY'RE BAD / THEY'RE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG.	You like musicals, don't you Dad?
I WOULDN'T / I COULDN'T / I HATE THAT STUFF!	WAKE UP DAD / YOU'RE SINGING A SONG!
AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.	IT'S A DESPERATE CRIMINAL / ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW / PLEASE SPARE MY CHILDREN!
SEE? ALL THIS SINGING SCARED HIM AWAY / IF WE JUST TALKED LIKE NORMAL, HE'D PROBABLY STAY.	A SINGING FAMILY! IT'S WORSE THAN I FEARED / FOR HOSTAGE PURPOSES / YOU'RE JUST TOO WEIRD. / BYE!
Okay.	I'M BACK, SO RESUME WETTING YOUR PANTS.
I knew I should've shut that window.	BECAUSE OF YOU ALL, I GOT A TUNE IN MY HEAD / AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT, IS TO MAKE YOU ALL DEAD.
EVEN THE CRIMINALS ARE BEGINNING TO CROON.	UH-OH, I'LL BE BACK WHEN I GET SOME AMMO. / BYE!
ALL RIGHT MARGE, YOU'VE CONVINCED ME, THERE ARE MORE TERRIBLE THINGS / THAN MUSICAL COMEDIES WHERE EVERYONE SINGS.	WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANY LOCAL LAWS PASSED / WITHOUT EVERYONE SINGING LIKE A BIG BROADWAY CAST.
And not a moment too soon.	Done, done.
The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how.	Come onnn. You have to go outside to do your... business.
Sor-reee, your majesty.	I'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.
Ice-cream-man-Ice cream-man!	Ding ding ding ding ding...
It's carnival time!	Looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
Here's money, kids! Take what you need!	It's carnival time!
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!	Oh boy! / All right, free money! / Wow!
Heart condition? Get outta here.	You can't go on that. You have a heart condition.
Obviously, I don't. Now if you'll get out of my way...	You had a quadruple bypass. You nearly died. Don't you remember?
"He's not just some ""guy,"" Marge. He's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. Carnies built this country. The carnival part of it, anyway. And though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men."	None taken.
Yes, sir!	Okay, let's go, fatty.
Do do do do do...	See any pigeons yet dad?
Who, me?	How 'bout you, Lucky!
Sorry, son. Daddy failed.	Ooh, almost... Rats, too hard... Oh, that was close... Wow, what a scam.
A novelty comb! Kings among men...	Oh, listen pal, I gotta son of my own. Here.
Hey, come on! He doesn't have any money. Look at his clothes.	Not so fast, pardner. You owe me some money.
Hey, that's not fair! I wanna be a carny, too! Can I, mister? Huh? Can I? Please?	At the carnival? Cool!
Sure, anything you want.	I don't know... You gonna get drunk and start a lot of trouble?
Oh-ho, put down your stick. We're here to work.	Hey, you lost your money fair and square. I didn't scam nobody.
Hmm...	Aw, now don't worry. That's just to scare off thieves.
Yeah, he's telling the truth.	Hmm...
Thanks for the food, Mister...	Yeah, he's telling the truth.
Did ya hear that, Bart? The Carny Code. Bart, did you hear that?	Name's Cooder. This is my boy, Spud. And there's no need to thank us. We carnival folk look out for each other. That's the Carny Code.
Yes, sir!	Ah, there you are. You two ready to work?
Fry up some cheese?	So what's our first job, huh? Test the roller coaster?
Please, folks. Hold your fire. The water level is dangerously low. Oh!	Ohh, this isn't fun... Maybe if you didn't go to the bathroom so much, you wouldn't be so small.
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ow! My leg!	Please, folks. Hold your fire. The water level is dangerously low. Oh!
Oh. Bart?	Go on, give it a try. And remember, big smiles.
Do I like chicken?	Yeah, Dad?
I guess not.	Does it matter?
Buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world.	Dad, we're saved!
Oh, we'll see about that. Gimme ten rings.	Ya see, the trick here is, the rings won't fit over the good prizes.
Ah, yes. How do we handle refunds?	Well, we gotta git. Here's the money box. Uh, any questions?
Gimme ten rings.	Good move.
Hey, there's a sucker.	Lookie, lookie, hey, hey, wocka, wocka! I got rings and you want 'em! Win a genuine Ronex watch. Just like a real moogie star!
Yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems.	We're natural born carnies, Dad. If only we weren't tied down with a family...
And how...	But I got a few complaints that your game is crooked.
I understand.	"Gee, I'd hate to close you down. Maybe we can reach a little, ah, ""understanding"" here..."
Not right now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman.	Um, hey, Dad, I, I think he wants a...
No. He's Bart.	"Uh, let me put it this way. I'm looking for my friend ""Bill."" Have you seen any ""Bills"" around here?"
Okay.	Listen carefully and watch me wink as I speak. Okay?
It's a ring toss game.	"The guy I'm really looking for, wink, is Mr. ""Bribe,"" wink, wink."
Well, ain't that somethin'.	All right, that's it. I'm shutting this game down.
Can't you stay in the Whack-A-Mole game?	Oh, good Lord. Our whole life was in that trailer. What are we gonna do now?
Yes, but first there's a little matter of the Carny Code.	I'm goin' for a corn dog. You want one?
Cooder, Spud. Get off that hog. You're coming to stay at our house.	Yes, but first there's a little matter of the Carny Code.
Oh, it won't be long. Once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. The older one can pull out his left eye.	How long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
Now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh Marge?	Ooo, what a nice surprise! This is so generous of you, Cooder.
That's weird. The key doesn't fit.	And how. / Heck yeah. / Yes they are. / You betcha.
Cooder! What have you done to our house?	What's going on?
You can't do this to me. What about the Carny Code?	They're squatting in our house?
Thank you so much.	Well, well, look who's here. Mr. No Bribe. Sure, we'll help ya. Just sit down and wait for Detective Like-I-give-a-damn.
Honey, Daddy's waiting for the detective.	Thank you so much.
Listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... You better not be in my ass-groove!	That Urkle's a hoot.
It took me years to forge that groove.	Homer!
Good Morning everybody.	Quit your yappin'! I'm freezin'!
Stupid Gravity.	Homer!!
I've got it!	No fires!
Aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. They're the cleverest folk in the world. Just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. That's it! Fire! Or...	There must be a way to outsmart them.
I've got a proposition for you, Cooder.	Aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. They're the cleverest folk in the world. Just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. That's it! Fire! Or...
One game of ring toss. If I can throw this Hula Hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. If I miss, I'll sign the deed over to you.	Yeah, I'm listenin'.
That's right.	So we'd own the house legit?
Now!	Oh, I can't watch.
Yeah, I guess your old man is smarter than you thought.	Way to go, Dad. You actually outwitted someone.
Look at 'em standing out there. No place to go. Heh, heh. Poor guys. Hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?	Yeah, I guess your old man is smarter than you thought.
My groove!	Homer...
They mushed it all out of shape.	My groove!
All right, better put on a pot of coffee, Marge. This could take a while.	They mushed it all out of shape.
Come on now, just a little more. Little more to the left... to the left there. What did he do this thing? Almost... Ahhhhhhhhh	All right, better put on a pot of coffee, Marge. This could take a while.
I always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school.	Thanks for lettin' me skip school to see the team come back from the championship, Dad.
This, Bart, is a crazy man.	Have you heard of Krishna Consciousness?
Right. That'll work.	Do unto others as you would have them do unto you!
Hmm. Makes sense.	A new and better life awaits you on our distant home planet, Blisstonia.
How much is this free resort weekend?	We're having a free get-acquainted session at our resort this weekend.
And when is this weekend?	It's free.
Uh huh. And how much does it cost?	It's this weekend.
I see. And when is it?	Um, it's free.
And what are you charging for this free weekend?	It's this weekend.
It's free, right?	C'mon, Dad! The team's arriving!
Who cares what it is? The point is these are some decent, generous people that I can take advantage of.	No we don't, Mother!
Marge, Marge, Marge. Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?	But what if they try to talk us into something?
So, I beat the system.	You bought four of them. Thank God the check bounced.
Yes. I am the highly suggestible type.	Watch yourself, Dad. You're the highly suggestible type.
Outta my way, jerk ass!	Welcome, brother!
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / FISH-ING, FISH-ING--	Outta my way, jerk ass!
Fish-ing.	Hi, how are y--
Who the hell is that? Some kind of leader?	It certainly is a beautiful day. We should thank the Leader.
Will there be beer?	Why don't you come chat with us about the Leader at the Welcome Center.
Homer no function beer well without.	Beer is not allowed.
What kind of beer?	Would you rather have beer or complete and utter contentment?
Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.	The Leader knows how miserable you, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie are.
Wow, a free movie. Thanks! Outta my way, jerk ass.	Just come up and watch our orientation film. You're free to leave at anytime.
Whoa, you've got my number on that one, buddy! This is a smart group.	Wow, a free movie. Thanks! Outta my way, jerk ass.
Now wait a minute, Moe --	And your stink brings tears to my eyes!
Wait - I'm confused about the movie. So the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?	The Leader is perfect!
Well, you see, when I get bored, I make up my own movie. I have a very short attention span.	What are you talking about? There's nothing like that in there.
Ooh, look a bird.	But our point is very simple. You see when --
Uh yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes.	Yeah, lose some weight! / Amen you're fat / moron-type
Oh, my mistake.	You've failed at everything you've ever tried.
You gonna finish that, bony?	He even ate mine!
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!	Or... NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER....
BATMAN! / I MEAN, LEADER! I LOVE THE LEADER!	NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!
ACT II	BATMAN! / I MEAN, LEADER! I LOVE THE LEADER!
Come again, Marge?	You what?!
I've joined the Movementarians! And so have all of you!	You what?!
All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor.	We what?
Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family.	I can't go along with this, Homer.
I have not been brainwashed. Kill the girl. Kill the girl.	Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?
What? What did I say?	Homer!
And it didn't cost us a dime.	Oh, yes you are. I'm afraid it's our home now. This house will become the new local Welcome Center for this district.
Hah, why even unpack?	Homer Simpson, your family will be housed here for the first 100,000 years. Then something might open up in a double.
That's a negatory, good buddy!	Yeah, maybe it'll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio.
See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now!	Oh, Lord. Uh, try the emergency plate, Ned.
Oh boy! We get to see the Leader pass by.	The Leader! / He's coming! / The Leader is coming! / The Leader! / etc.
Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American, but what are ya gonna do?	We toil in the fields and he rides around in a Rolls Royce?
I've never been so happy.	Oh, look who the new pet is!
But Marge, we're not mass married.	This is ridiculous, we're already married!
These lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch. Oh! A lima bean that looks just like the Leader! I'll put it with the others.	We love him...He loves we...We're the Leader's Fa-mi-ly.
What an honor! We've been called into the presence of --	Yaaay! Here comes the Leader!
Marge? You're the Leader? You don't look anything like the beans.	What an honor! We've been called into the presence of --
The Leader knows all and sees all.	All right, Now, what's so all-fired great about your fancy-pants Leader?
And he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.	Eww, well, that is impressive.
Beer?	Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?
But I want to go.	Homer, you don't have to go with them!
I'm glad I'm back! Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, I was born again!	He's our husband now.
Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! He's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!	Hallelujah!
Whoops.	Homer Simpson! Because of your lack of faith, you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation!
To think I turned to a cult for mindless happiness when I had beer all along.	Come back to papa, baby.
Yeah. He's my favorite fictional character.	Whoa, cool! God is so in-your-face.
Woo hoo!	Oh, all right. You can stay up late tonight. But tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock.
Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.	Aw, those poor badgers are soaked.
I can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers. I have Smallpox... Well, it wasn't wiped out in my house.	Oh my goodness! That was a long movie! It's time for school! Let's go! Let's go!
Water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice...	Okay, kids. Otto's in charge. Remember, Otto, we're trusting you with our greatest natural resource, the school bus.
Flancrest Enterprises?	Water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice...
You liar. You don't have a home business. Why would you make up a lie like that?	Oops! That's for me. Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.
Internet, eh?	No-ho-ho, it's true! Maude and I sell religious hook rugs over the Internet.
Scratch, eh?	Yes indeedy. Makin' some good scratch, too.
Maude, eh?	Yep.
No time to answer that, Marge. I'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise.	Homer, what are you doing?
Ever heard of a little thing called the Internet?	What business enterprise?
Oh yeah, everybody's making money off the Internet except us. We've fallen behind. Way behind.	Internet, eh?
Can't discuss that now, Marge. I have to write another delicious memo.	Is that my good butter?
Mmm... memo.	Can't discuss that now, Marge. I have to write another delicious memo.
What am I gonna call my Internet company? All the good names are taken. Oh, wait, I've got it! Flancrest Enterprises.	Exactly.
Uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting edge, like Cutco... or Edgecom... Interslice... Come on, Marge -- you're good at these. Help me out.	What exactly is it your company does again?
Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President.	How about CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet?
CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet. Junior Vice President Homer Simpson speaking. How may I direct your call?	Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President.
It's Patty.	CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet. Junior Vice President Homer Simpson speaking. How may I direct your call?
Welcome to the Internet, my friend. How can I help you?	Hey, what the-- Huh, the Internet King. I wonder if he can provide faster nudity.
Can I have some money now?	Will you be able to provide an IP router that's compatible with my token-ring ethernet LAN configuration?
Ooo, they have the Internet on computers now...	The hunt is on...
Bill Gates? Billionaire computer nerd Bill Gates? Oh my God, oh my God! Get out of sight, Marge! I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!	Homer, Bill Gates is here.
You don't look so rich.	Mr. Simpson?
Get a load of the bowl job, Marge.	Don't let the haircut fool you. I'm exceedingly wealthy.
This is it, Marge. I poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! We're rich! Richer than astronauts!	Your Internet ad was brought to my attention. But I can't figure out what, if anything, CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet does. So rather than risk competing with you, I've decided simply to buy you out.
Oh, right. I reluctantly accept your proposal.	Homer, quiet. You'll queer the deal.
Hey, what the hell's going on?!	"Well, everyone always does. ""Buy him out,"" boys!"
Well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him.	What do we need church shoes for? Jesus wore sandals.
Well, well, well... If it isn't Professor Know-it-all. 'Scuse me, Marge.	Look, Homer. There's that bird you like to argue with.
That's where you're wrong, pal!	Hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman.
It's not enough to want a cracker. You have to earn it!	That's where you're wrong, pal!
Why, yes. Yes I do.	Excuse me, sir? Do you like to laugh?
A rest home for pirates?	Well, then you'll love our comedy festival. It's for a good cause.
Now that's a fight I wanna be a part of.	No, Dad, it's to fight soil erosion.
I don't get it.	I finally got around to reading the dictionary. Turns out the zebra did it.
I still don't get it.	Dad, the zebra didn't do it. It's just a word at the end of the dictionary.
Oh I get it. I get jokes.	It's just a joke.
Yes! Yes! Oh, God yes!	Plus, I got this new boyfriend. And you know how it is when you're kissing a guy with a tongue stud...
Take that, Marge!	'Bout time. Gimme those reviews.
Woop, sorry son. I didn't know you, Jay Leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown.	Dad!
Oooh! Oh! Krusty!	Thank you. Thank you. And now, the all new comedy stylings of... Krrrusty the Clown...
Booo!	Uhh... what about 2 cent stamps?... pizza pie's very hot these days, uh... can't open pickle jars, no mail on Sunday... out of paper towels... Oh! Oh! Oh! What's the deal with cardboard?...
I also have to go. Booo!	Me too...
I'll cover ya, honey.	Four drink minimum?
Woo! TV! Yeah!	So, I'm watchin' TV today...
Impeach Churchill!	Yeah! / Right On, Krusty! / You Tell 'Em!
Take that, you greedy fat cats. Marge, gimme your purse.	It's my allowance, Mother, and I'll burn it the way I want.
From now on, I'm gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs.	I thought I made myself clear in Boston.
You too, Bart.	Dad!
You didn't have to tell it like it is, Marge.	Oh, knock it off, Homer. You're the fattest one in the car...
I hope he tells us to burn our pants. These things are drivin' me nuts!	I brought a bag of money in case he wants us to burn it again.
Don't you hate pants?	Oooo! / What did you do? /
Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath.	Ow! Bart, that has nuts in it!
Aw, I understand, kids. I'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man.	Yeah, Mom says a lot of things.
Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.	Actually, we can't take a bath anyway. The water heater is broken.
Hmmm.	Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.
Outta my way! She's gonna blow!	Hmmm.
Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.	What on earth -- ?!
To Marge. And all the blissful years I've spent hiding from her in this bar.	Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
Whatever happened to your mail order bride?	Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? Ech, I'm sorry, Homer. It's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman.
So her career got in the way.	Ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a Micronesian swamp.
Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe. You're a fabulous catch.	Yeah, I don't blame her. No girl wants to end up with a Joe Puke-pail like me.
He thought he was gonna steal--	Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe. You're a fabulous catch.
Oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. But that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. Come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town.	Yeah, well, uh, how come I ain't fendin' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?
Relax. All I smell is garlic and fish.	Ah, I don't know, Homer. Women can smell panic. And, uh, right now, I gotta be reekin' of it.
Okay, I won't lie to you. A lot of people saw that. But you gotta keep tryin'.	It's all yours.
Hey, don't give up, Moe. The girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar.	No, I'm in love with you.
Let's get out of here, Moe. This is goin' nowhere.	I like a face with character.
Stop kissing that cat and get in the car!	Who cares? You're goin' out with me. She's going out with me, cat!
Maa-rrge...	So, Renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to Moe. Do you mind if I ask why?
Oh, yeah, I got that.	But he's really grown on me. He's got this insecure, sweaty charm.
Aw, come on, Moe. Think of all you have to offer besides money.	Well, that's it. It's all over. Renee ain't gonna wanna hang around with no Joe Pinchpenny.
If you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car.	Ah, Homer, what am I gonna do? Renee's my last chance for true love.
Steal? Oh no, you got the wrong guy.	Nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. But it is insured... For five grand... Homer, I need your help. You gotta steal this car and wreck it for me.
You dropped somethin'.	Steal? Oh no, you got the wrong guy.
Oh, you did. But -- I still don't know... I can just imagine what Marge would say.	C'mon, Homer! I'm one of your dearest friends! When everybody said you were too drunk to drive that time, who gave you your keys?
I'll do it!	Homer, I insist you steal that car.
Mmmm... me.	Okay, here's the plan. This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now...
What about the cops?	"Listen up, here. Tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you ""steal"" my car."
So, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?	That's the beauty part. Every cop in town's gonna be on the Police Department's Moonlight Charity Cruise. And I'm gonna be right there with 'em.
You're a genius, Moe. All your troubles will soon be over for a couple months.	WHAM! The insurance company pays off five thousand clams. I keep showing Renee the sweet life.
Why all the pearls? Why all the hair? Why anything?	Why all the black?
No, you look a little nervous, Lisa.	You look a little nervous, Dad.
No. I'm just going out to commit certain deeds.	You're up to something, aren't you?
Suckers.	No. I'm just going out to commit certain deeds.
I'm gonna be the best car thief ever.	Oo-hoo-hoo... that's sweet.
Hey! Oh, no you don't!	I'm gonna be the best car thief ever.
"They're showing ""Hail to the Chimp!"" Oh, I have time to see one little movie!"	"""Stealing, stealing / Stealing a car for Moe / Dada dada dada dada / Insurance fraud today..."""
That's what you get for not hailing to the Chimp.	Get off me, Mr. President!
Oh, no! The train!	Aw...
Homer, you genius.	Homer, you moron...
Ger-onimo!	Homer, you genius.
Huh?	Ger-onimo!
Whoa! Hang on a minute! The guard said I have visitors coming!	Homer, did you really steal a car?
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Great! Listen, I know it looks bad. But all I can tell you is I destroyed that car for all the right reasons.	Dad, we're the visitors.
That's my girl. You just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. Moe will take care of everything.	I'd like to believe you...
Aw, thanks, boy. I'll give you two packs for that candy bar.	Well, Dad, in the meantime, here's a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff.
Why you little...	Three.
Moe! Oh, Moe, thank God you're here!	Pssst. Homer. Homer. Wake up.
But I'm in jail.	Yeah, congratulations, Homer. The plan worked perfectly.
Moe, you gotta get me outta here. Tell the cops I didn't steal the car. Say you lent it to me.	Yeah, yeah, that's, that's a kick in the pants.
But Moe, we're best friends...	Yeah, I wish I could, Homer, but if I change my story, they're gonna throw me in here.
Hurry, Moe. At three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. The exercise yard!	Ohh, cripes, the puppy-dog look. All right, all right. I'll use the money to bail you out.
Hurry up, Moe, for the love of God! Hurry up!	Ten minutes till fresh air and exercise.
Hawaii? What about Hawaii? Moe? Who's going to Hawaii? Am I going to Hawaii?	"Hawaii, here we come! ""I Nanakuli makou 'ai ana o na uluwahi Hawaii!"""
Let me out! I'm innocent! I changed my mind, I don't want to be in here anymore!	Hey! Stop saying Hawaii in there!
Hmm... This could be useful...	Would you care for some reading material?
Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee! Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee!	Uh-oh.
You!	Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee! Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee!
Oh-ho, I'll help you. Help you die!	Homer! Thank God, you gotta help me here!
I... also sleep... G'night, Mommy...	Oh, boy... Uh, I really wanna sleep...
Ohh, I could never stay mad at you, Moe. After all, you get me drunk.	Oh, Homer, I been the world's biggest rat. Can you ever forgive me?
Aw, Moe, Moe, Moe, dry those beady little eyes. Your buddy Homer'll get you back on your feet.	Aww! Ah, my poor bar. It's all gone.
Woo hoo!	Kids, from now on, I don't want you touching anything in our house. Dart!
Um, I'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito.	More comin'.
Oh, forget it!	You'll have it in forty-five seconds, sir.
Well, why would I want to look at a pen with a... Oh no, her clothes are coming off! Heh, heh. Hey, you know who would love this? Men.	To pass the time, please enjoy this novelty pen.
Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!	Well, why would I want to look at a pen with a... Oh no, her clothes are coming off! Heh, heh. Hey, you know who would love this? Men.
Hey, hey look, a freezer man!	Old man? Old ma...
I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.	Wait a minute... There is a note!
Now you're swingin', honey!	I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
Room for one more...	Hey, Lis. Wanna join us?
Hey, yeah.	Yeah... Huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!
Bo-ring!	And now a Channel 6 editorial reply...
Boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! Marge, we need five thousand CC's of snacks, stat!	Okay... Make-up!
What way, angel pie?	I don't want to turn out that way!
Fine, she doesn't get her skin!	Lisa! Come on! Your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
If I were her, I'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake.	I'm getting worried about Lisa. She's been gone for hours.
Moochin' war widows...	I'm supposed to talk to you about Proposition 305...
That's a good idea. Let's go out for some frosty swirls.	Beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. You can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower...
We'll tape it!	Homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!
"Pff... ""Simpson gene!"" Somebody's got to set that girl straight. And I know how to do it."	Little girl -- likes her brain. What's your opinion?
Marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat.	"Pff... ""Simpson gene!"" Somebody's got to set that girl straight. And I know how to do it."
Lisa, it's me, Daddy, your father. I rounded up every Simpson in the tri-city area, so I can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the Simpson genes. This is your Great-Uncle Chet. Go ahead, Chet, tell her what you do.	Better. Come look.
Oh. But... you run it, right?	I run an unsuccessful shrimp company.
Okay. Uh, this is your second cousin Stanley.	Oh, yeah.
Everybody hates birds! ...Right!	Uh, I shoot birds at the airport.
Well uh, you look pretty successful.	Everybody hates birds! ...Right!
What about you?	You probably should've researched this first, eh, Dad?
Oh, Lisa's right. We're nothing but a big bunch of losers. Show's over, folks. Go home.	My legs hurt.
You get it after you leave. Now get out of here.	What about our five bucks?
"Fine, fine. What do you do... ""Dr. Simpson""?"	Wait a minute, Homer! You didn't ask everybody. What about the women?
Oh well, thanks, honey. Remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a Simpson and a success.	Oh Dad, I've never been happier to be your daughter.
Yes, son. A spectacular failure.	So, wait a minute. This means I'm gonna be a failure?
"Yeah. Good things don't end with ""eum."" They end with ""mania""... Or ""teria."" Will there be beer?"	Me. I smell a museum.
What'd he say? What about my car?	"Welcome to the Knowledgeum! I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such automated information kiosks as ""Welcome to Springfield Airport"" and ""Where's Nordstrom?"" While you're enjoying our Hall Of Wonders, your car will unfortunately be subject to repeated break-ins..."
I'm gonna try the sex education computer!	I wanna read the giant book!
Ovulate, damn you! Ovulate!	No more pictures!
Then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. But we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. Oh yeah, and my other friend was already there.	Help! She's touching my special area!
Woo hoo! Beer, beer, beer!	All right, all right, now. You're over-stimulated. Let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed.
Uh-oh.	But people will see me paired up with a doofus. You have no idea what that's like.
"""Hi, this is Jerry Maguire. Show me the message. Show me the message."""	Oh, Ralph, do you realize what we can do with... Get me a towel.
"""Do the message! Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."""	"""This is Geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. So, here come de beep. Here come de beep."""
"""Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."" ""After the beep."""	Ohh, I found something all right.
You're the man, Ralph!	But asking you was Ralph's idea.
Uh, Maybe.	Did you just take a bite out of me?
Yep, I earned it.	Homer, wake up! It's time for our coffee break.
Mmmm, donuts.	Yep, I earned it.
Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big.	Yeah and you drooled all over it, ya--
Success!	Uh, sir, we've found the problem. Some idiot threw this in the reactor core.
It's my first day.	You did this? How could you be so irresponsible?
It's my first day.	Oh, really? Why did you think you could lie to me?
Fired. I can't believe it.	Well, why didn't you say- Whoa! You're fired!
Ooh, funky.	"Next, on Exploitation Theater: ""Blackula,"" followed by ""Blackenstein."" And the ""Blunch Black of Blotre Blame."""
I've joined the naval reserve.	But first, this word.
You know Lisa, I've taken a lot from this country. Maybe it's time I gave something back.	After basic training you'll only have to work one weekend a month. And most of that time you're drunk off your ass!
Would you be proud of me?	Are you thinking of joining the Naval Reserve?
Then I'll do it!	Eh, sort of.
There's a question that's crossed out.	Just fill out this form and you're on your way to the Reserve.
"Well, I think I can make it out. ""Are you a homosex..."""	Well, due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to ask that particular question.
But I'm not a h--	For God's sake, don't answer that! I could go to jail!
Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay?	La la la la la la la! I am not listening! La la la la la la la la!
Not to worry, honey. We live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light.	Homie, I really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. What if you get called into combat?
Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping.	We don't have a Clapper.
Nighty-night!	Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping.
Well, guys, I won't be seeing you for a while.	Nighty-night!
"Gee, thanks guys. This is just like ""The Deer Hunter."""	And although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, I'm in too.
See ya in a week.	I'm sorry guys. We're shuttin' down for a while. Sorry.
Aw, that's sweet, honey. I'll bring you back a hat.	Good luck, Dad. Although I am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part.
No.	Hey, Homer, bring me back a torpedo.
Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him! I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!	But Flanders got his kids torpedoes.
But only if you're good. Even if you're not.	Homer!
I'm a freak!	No way, man! My hair is who I am!
What the--?	I'm a freak!
Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat.	Tuck in that shirt -- shine those shoes, mister -- oh, for the love of --
I like you.	All right, Simpson. I don't like you and you don't like me --
Maybe you would like me if you got to know me.	Um, all right. You like me, but I don't like you!
Well, I'm no Margaret Cho, but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression. Ah, one more thing - One- I should get a glass of water.	What are you, a comedian?
Ulll.....	Very nice, Simpson. But next time tie the other end to the ship!
Request permission to come aboard.	Nuh-uh, that's a vampire! But, uh, they're also covered. Carry on.
Marge!	Permission granted.
You know Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did. I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later, I'm gonna get Gilligan's autograph.	Stop laughing at me!
Then I'll whomp him with my hat.	I'm so proud of you, Homie.
Bart!	Hello everybody. Sparkle sparkle.
Get back here, boy!	Milhouse jumped off a cliff? I'm there!
You're a disgrace to this family and its proud Naval tradition!	Get back here, boy!
I always thought Lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.	Well, I'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!
No!	Can I?
Nu-cue-lar. It's pronounced NU-cue-lar.	Next weekend we're having our annual war games. Now Simpson, because of your many years as a nuclear technician we're putting you on a nuclear sub.
Oh, Lisa, it's just war games. It's not like a game could hurt me.	Be careful, Dad.
Damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! Can't we all just get along?	Oh, Lisa, it's just war games. It's not like a game could hurt me.
We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace.	Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well, I guess that's everyone. Except earring-boy.	We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace.
Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced but this is completely different!	Come on, Dad. Didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?
Uh, is the poopdeck really what I think it is?	I'm a man of few words! Any questions?
What's a jib?	I like the cut of your jib.
Thank you.	Homer! Join us.
I want peas.	Tell me, young man. What do you want out of life?
Uh-huh.	We all want peace. But it's always just out of reach.
With a knife.	So what's the best way to get peace?
And you're like the father I never visit.	Exactly. Not with the olive branch but the bayonet. Ah Simpson, you're like the son I never had.
Me?	I'll take care of it. Oh, what the Hell -- Simpson, while I'm gone, you're in command.
Ooh, comfy.	Contraband!
I'unno.	Homer, we've got an enemy sub closing in fast. What do we do?
Hmm. What would the Captain say in my spot?	Fifteen seconds to collision. We need a decision!
Fire the torpedoes!	Don't fire the torpedoes.
All right, all right, mellow out, everybody. The Captain'll know what to do.	We're losing back-up power!
I am?	That means you're in charge, Homer.
Very well then. I'm a Captain.	Those were the orders.
Mr. Moe -- steady as she goes!	Very well then. I'm a Captain.
Damage report, Mr. Moe.	Aye aye ya big dummy. Ehhh...what a dummy.
Enough of what's out! What's in?	Sonar, out. Navigation, out. Radio, out.
Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way.	Ice-blended mocha drinks and David Schwimmer.
Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two...	Captain, how are we supposed to get home with no equipment?
All right. I can't waste any more time. People's lives are depending on me. Mr. Sulu -- make a left!	Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two...
That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes.	Aye, aye, Captain. Setting course for Rigel 7... I mean, home.
On second thought, go right.	That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes.
Oh my God! We're all gonna die!	Drop the depth charges. We'll either destroy it or force it to surface.
Y'ello.	Oh my God! We're all gonna die!
You mean water?	Mayday! Mayday! The engine room has sprung a leak! It's filling up with a clear, non-alcoholic liquid.
I guess that's it. Ladies and gentlemen... We're in a tough spot and I don't know if we're gonna get out. Please remain calm and think of your loved ones.	Yeah, that's it. We've got a pinhole leak and there's no way to plug it!
Bart!	Sparkle sparkle!
I'll plug your hole. I mean, eureka!	Dad, the earring could plug the hole.
Mr. Moe, prepare to surface.	You saved us, Homer.
Uhhh... it's my first day!	Attention, Homer Simpson! You have ten seconds to explain your actions before we open fire!
Es mi dia primero. Wuo gang kai shuchun gong chuo Quack quack quack.	Uhhh... it's my first day!
Woo hoo!	I think you're off the hook.
"You can't spell ""dishonorable"" without ""honorable."""	A dishonorable discharge! It's the best we could've hoped for.
Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart.	I think you're a hero, Dad.
Boy, I guess I was wrong about that earring. It saved us all.	Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart.
I don't think so, son.	"Then can I get a tattoo that says, ""Bite Me?"" You never know when it might come in handy."
No.	A king cobra?
Ask your mother.	Weapons-grade plutonium?
No.	Knock-out drops?
Maybe for Christmas.	Ninja death stars?
Oh, will this horrible year never end?	Eight-Eight-Eight...
What is it, Sweetie? Did you see a scary picture in your picture book?	Dad!
No, because... You see I went ahead and... Year-wise, I was counting forward from the last previous...	That was last year's taxes! You have to pay again this year!
I have a to do pile?	I put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
Marge, how many kids do we have? Oh, no time to count, I'll just estimate. Uh, nine.	I have a to do pile?
Shutup! Shutup! If I don't hear you, it's not illegal. Okay, I need some deductions! Deductions! Ah! Business gifts!	Homer, you know we don't have...
Here you go. Keep using nuclear power.	Shutup! Shutup! If I don't hear you, it's not illegal. Okay, I need some deductions! Deductions! Ah! Business gifts!
Okay, Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, Lisa's a clergyman, Maggie is seven people and Bart was wounded in Vietnam...	Homer, I painted that for you.
If I don't see it, it's not illegal!	You really had a lot of talent, kid.
Oh, no you don't!	If I don't see it, it's not illegal!
C'mon, get in there. Drop.	Oh, no you don't!
Woo hoo!	C'mon, get in there. Drop.
Well...	What about you, Homer?
Help! Somebody!	Homer Simpson? United States Government.
No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy told me to do it.	Mr. Simpson, this government computer can process over nine tax returns per day. Did you really think you could fool it?
No sir, please. I can't go to prison. They pee in a cup and throw it on ya. I saw it in a movie!	You're looking at five years, minimum.
No, please, I'll do anything!	You won't be seeing any prison movies where you're going... Prison!
I'm very happy to meet you.	Anything? Well, that's a start. Agent Johnson, FBI.
Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I got a little tax problem.	From now on you're gonna work for us.
Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice.	They want you to spy on your friends?
Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president.	The government has no right to use you this way.
Does this make me look fat?	There you go, Ratboy.
But not fat.	No, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression.
So if my cover gets blown and I need help, what's the signal?	But not fat.
How 'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?	Oh, God!
Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.	You sayin' you want to commit a crime, Homer?
Uhhhh, like those. But involving you.	Or that telemarketing scam you pulled?
Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.	Oh, you, you mean like the time Barney beat up George Bush.
Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission.	Hey, how did they finger Charlie? Somebody musta ratted him out.
Well, I'm just glad it's all over.	My superiors were pleased with your work. You have a flair for treachery.
Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name was on that tax return, too.	Ohh, you're not through, Simpson. We have a high-risk assignment for you.
Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.	Let's take a walk.
Losers...	In 1945, the people of Europe struggled to rebuild following the war.
Ooh! A trillion-dollar bill? 'Atsa spicy meatball!	To make good on this drunken boast, Truman authorized the one-time printing of the largest denomination currency ever: a trillion-dollar bill.
But Mr. Burns gave me my job. And he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one China Syndrome. I can't betray him.	Well, I won't go without a fight, wink, wink. Heh. Let me show you around.
I'm in.	Sometimes I don't know why I bother.
Uh, I'm Homer Simpson, your trusted employee.	Now what, Smithers? I... You're not Smithers.
Uhh, I don't know what to tell you.	Hmm... A pack of vicious dogs should be ripping you to pieces...
Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside...	It'll, uh, be a few minutes. So, what brings you to my home?
Still cold.	Ya! Ha!
Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.	Hmm. Well, let me get you a towel.
C'mon... Where are you?... Here, Trilly, Trilly.	Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
Uhmmmm... Errr... Uhhhhh...	What is this? What are you doing?
Uh, yeah, sure. That thing.	You're from Collier's magazine, aren't you? Are you going to put me in Star Snoop?
No you don't. Heh, heh.	Well, of course, I didn't want a racehorse in my living room, but you don't say no to Spring Byington, do you?
Ewww!	Heh, heh, heh. Heh, heh. Ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in.
Is that a fish?	That intrepid lad is my great grandfather! Franklin Jefferson Burns. Tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the Fenway Flounder.
Hey, that guy looks like you.	It was.
Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?	Let's move.
Wowww, that must be worth a fortune.	Well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? I keep the real bill right here.
Hey, he's right...	I'm not the thief, the government is. Every year you make hard-working Joes like my reporter friend here pay income taxes, and for what? Aid to ungrateful foreigners, do-nothing nuclear missiles, tomb polish for some unknown soldier...
I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.	Ohh, you can silence me, but you can't silence Collier's magazine! Tell the people! Don't let the government push you around! You have a choice! Fight back!
Take that, Uncle Sam!	I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.
We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.	Faster, Simpson! Those jack-booted G-men won't be far behind.
Ohh, we're never gonna make it. Let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways.	That really was more of a burgundy...
But I can't leave the country! What about my wife and kids?	Capital idea! Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand. We'll purchase a small island somewhere and start our own country, free from the relentless tyranny of Uncle Sam.
We'd better do what he says.	Attention fugitives. You are leaving U.S. jurisdiction. Turn back immediately or we will be unable to prosecute you.
Woo hoo! We can gamble!	No, wait! We're now over international waters.
Yes!	Woo hoo! We can gamble!
I call President!	Any of these islands would make a fine new country.
Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There's shredded pork everywhere.	Purpose of visit?
Nice to meet you.	Es carne de burro.
I had no idea.	So, you say Batista's gone? Did you know that?
Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President of Cuba.	Please, we are all amigos here.
God bless America!	Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that, too. And if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, I'll soon be guilty of that!
Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm.	"That ""Mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
That'll do it, Apu. So just--	Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm.
Helper monkey, eh?	Do not be alarmed. That is just my helper monkey, sir. I got him after a robber shot me six times and left me for dead.
I'd like a monkey, please. And maybe one of those dogs. What do they do?	Good luck, kids. Where the hell's my grilled cheese?
Do they do any other tricks?	Ah, they serve as seeing eyes for the blind, sir.
Just the monkey then.	No.
Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy.	"Ahh, may I inquire as to how you are ""differently abled""?"
Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back.	Uh, sir, helper monkeys are only for the physically challenged or enfeebled.
Mind if I take him for a ride?	Oh, son, this monkey's gonna change my life.
There a problem, honey?	Between you and me, he's well... kinda dumb.
Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch.	Monkey! There's a monkey in the house!
Simpson residence.	Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch.
"This ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."	Why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
Marge! The kids are on!	"And now... ""Kids News."""
Honey, he's clearly marked his territory.	Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.
Marge, can I get a duck?	Excellent.
Can he get a duck?	You already have a monkey.
Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one.	Come on. Come to Poppa.
Oh, I don't need your pity.	Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping!
And so on.	Hmm. It really makes you think.
Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?	They gave you a chopper?!
No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance.	I want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day.	Come on, Mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money.
They didn't have Lord Huggington?	I'm Sir Loves-a-Lot, the bear who loves to love!
I guess.	It's the same basic bear, Homey.
Kiss it.	Kiss it and make it boogie!
Oh-ho yeahhh...	Uh, maybe later.
Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime.	Uh, what a terrible waste!
Crap -- py -- stuff.	Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime.
Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.	Yep, that's the rule. He who tops it off, drops it off.
Ooh, but I can rebuild!	I heard that! You know the rule.
Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho!	Ooh, but I can rebuild!
You're pushin' me, baby.	Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho!
Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage!	You're pushin' me, baby.
You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!	And the school nurse says Bart has the plague.
Uh oh.	You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!
I don't know. A lot of people were yelling stuff.	What did you call us?
That was yesterday, moron!	Didn't you learn anything from Love Day?
Good news, everyone. I got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service.	That was yesterday, moron!
Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men.	Oh lord! Now what are we going to do? Just let the trash pile up?
I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.	Dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?
Siddown, honey. The men will clear the table!	I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.
So long, chicken bone.	Siddown, honey. The men will clear the table!
No room for you, Jell-O.	See you in hell, brussel sprouts.
Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him.	Oooooh!
Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill.	Uh, listen Homer, ah, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all, but Maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors...
So-ho, the rats seem happy.	Go! Go! Go!
That's not the way she tells it.	Homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again.
Uh, it's like the measles. Good to get it out of the way.	That's not the way she tells it.
Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack.	Yeah Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize.
Apologize for that remark.	I think you're startin' to crack.
Attaboy!	No way.
Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about...	Attaboy!
Hey! Woo-hoo! I won!	Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about...
This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won.	Hey! Woo-hoo! I won!
And to think you wanted me to crawl, Marge! Well, this man doesn't crawl. He stands tall. That rhymes, Marge, and you know it rhymes. Admit it!	This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won.
You signed my name? I feel so violated.	Oh Homer, you didn't beat City Hall! They picked up our trash because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner and signed your name. Period.
But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?	You've signed my name lots of times.
Perfect.	Yes.
Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp.	Here's your apology back, Mr. Simpson, and I'm sorry we couldn't work this out.
Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras.	I'm not tryin' to scare you. I'm just tryin' to get my work done, here.
I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages.	What cameras? Why are you still here?
You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy!	Hey, stop that!
Never!	Leave the bird alone!
You want to know what I think?	Look Simpson, I've been elected by the voters of this city sixteen years in a row, so they must think I'm doing a damn good job.
Well, we'll see about that.	No! Nobody wants to hear the nonsensical ravings of a loud-mouthed malcontent!
I want to register to run for Sanitation Commissioner. And tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!	Hey!
Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating.	Hey, everybody, vote for my Dad, Homer Simpson. If you don't he'll beat us.
Hey, vote Simpson... Hi... Nice to see ya... Heh, thanks for comin' out... Keep puttin' on weight, huh? Lenny, my man.	Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating.
What am I, the answer man? Just vote for me.	So, Homer, if we vote for you, whaddaya gonna do different?
These old geezers just don't get it. It's time to rock the vote.	Yea, I know. It's a peace of mind issue you know?
Potato man.	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Can I help you?
Take a hike, Kojak.	Okay, camera two... Uh, excuse me, this is a restricted area.
Quiet, you! I know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. But I also know you care about the race for Sanitation Commissioner. So, let me give ya the 911...	What the bloody hell?
That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it?	Why should they vote for you?
My campaign is a disaster, Moe.	Don't worry, folks. He'll get the help he needs.
I hate the public so much. If only they'd elect me... I'd make 'em pay. Oh Moe, how do I make 'em like me?	My campaign is a disaster, Moe.
Can't someone else do it?	Ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there.
It is?	"""Can't someone else do it?"" That's perfect!"
Woo hoo!	Yeah. Now get out there and spread that message to the people!
Can't someone else do it?	Whoa, whoa, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.
Fellow citizens! How would you rate the trash service in this town?	Seriously, gimme the money.
Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?	I would deem it excellent.
Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?	Oh man, you got that right. / Yeah. / I guess so. / It's so annoying in the morning/ Yes. / Uh-huh.
Well then...	I'll say.
Well then, can't someone else do it?	Well then...
And can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?	Hey, yeah!
Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico.	Yeah! / Someone else! / Someone else! / Yeah!
Don't you deserve better than the best?	Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico.
Who should handle all your dirty jobs?	Yeah!
I'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. I'm sure he had more important things to do.	Someone else! Someone else! Someone else!
Well, then you shoulda been early.	Sorry I'm late, everyone. Somebody tampered with my brakes.
Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables...	Oh, c'mon, people. This man has promised round the clock trash pick-up. That's impossible!
Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops.	I can't believe what I'm hearing!
Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?	"""Pops?"" I'm only two years older than you!"
What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth?	What button? What the hell are you talkin' about?!
Woo hoo!	All right, fine. If you want an experienced public servant, vote for me. But if you wanna believe a bunch of crazy promises about garbage men cleaning your gutters and waxing your car -- then by all means, vote for this sleazy lunatic.
Fifty cents? Not likely.	Aren't you gonna buy it, Dad?
Hey, Ray. Cleanin' out the old office, eh?	Fifty cents? Not likely.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Ray. Are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?	If I hadn't already packed my letter opener, I'd give you such a stabbing...
Yeah, that was just a lie.	Friendship? You told people I lure children into my gingerbread house.
See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle.	Simpson, the American people have never tolerated incompetence in their public officials. You are going to crash and burn, my fat-headed friend.
Jean-Paul, how are the new uniforms? Do they match the suede boots? Beautiful. Did you get the new trucks? Are they amphibious? Well, there's only one way to find out. We can always buy more.	See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle.
Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises.	Wow, Dad, you're really working hard.
Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can.	I'm really proud of you, Homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?
WHO CAN TAKE YOUR TRASH OUT? / STOMP IT DOWN FOR YOU? / SHAKE THE PLASTIC BAG AND DO THE TWISTY-THINGY TOO? / THE GARBAGE MAN...	Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can.
Oh no! Wait, I think I've got the perfect solution.	Simpson, you idiot, you spent your entire year's budget in a month. Your department's broke.
They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge. A stamp!	How could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!	You know Dad, there's a lesson in all this. Many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just...
'Mornin', boys.	Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!
Will cash be okay?	My men ain't workin' another minute till we get paid.
Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money?	Did I hear a briefcase opening?
Close, but you're way off.	I'll have to say drugs, too.
Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine.	Close, but you're way off.
Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.	Good God, Homer! You're turning our wonderful little town into America's trash-hole.
Sure I can, Honey-kitten.	But Dad, you can't cram garbage under Springfield forever.
Uh, nothin'.	What the hell is that?
Now, uh, you were saying how great I was...?	Uh, nothin'.
Nay!	And all those opposed to horse-whipping Homer Simpson?
Come to what?	I can't believe it's come to this.
Yeah, it's somethin', all right.	Moving the whole town five miles down the road! It's crazy!
Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.	So we transplant the town. We're just gonna trash the new Springfield, too.
Hi Moe.	Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.
Yeah, but can he do this?	Wowwww! McBain has really buffed up. You could grate cheese on those abs.
What? They had a picnic last week.	Anyway, it's time for the church picnic.
If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin.	No they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
Ooo, still plenty of parking.	Aw nuts!
Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food.	Nice to see you, Homer.
Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?	Oh, you'd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. C'mon, Dad. We're playing Capture the Flag!
Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so?	But Rod picked his Dad. It's a matter of family honor.
I agree. Let's surrender.	Okay, Dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good...
Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair.	No, wait. I have a plan. But I'll need your underpants.
Stupid kids...	Get him!
Time out... t... time out...	Tag tag tag tag tag!
Oh, stop it!	Oh, I don't think he can get up. Let's egg him!
I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.	Hey, h-he's trying to turn over.
Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this?	I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.
Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape.	Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time.	Whatever you say, sweetie.
Okay, here we go...	Oh, great. Now the cat knows.
I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside.	Look, son. Daddy got in shape. E--
Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here?	So what will it be, Mr. Simpson? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies?
Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy.	Oh, well, we have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced-fat soda. And our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free.
Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow.	Oh yes, that is a new item. No bar contains more applesauce.
"""Gym?"" What's a ""Gym?"""	Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow.
Ohhh... a gym.	"""Gym?"" What's a ""Gym?"""
Ow! Ow! Ow! Boy, am I feeling this. Ow! Oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. Ow!	Ohhh... a gym.
Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling--	Excuse me. You're doing this station all backwards. Let me show you how to do it like a man.
"Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. This place is great."	Push! Harder! Go past the max! Reach over the top! Master your ass!
Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh-ho, well, I'm flattered, but spoken for. Oh, what the heck, give me your number.	Um-hm.
I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!	And your shirt!
Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--	Oh my goodness gracious!
No, not there.	Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--
Not there either. Over here.	No, not there.
No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps.	I've got some!
Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?	Whoaa...
How can you put that filth into your bodies?	Damn right.
Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all.	My casserole is not filth. Eat it.
You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action.	Now that's just non--
Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar.	Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. Food. I mean, food.
Hm.	Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar.
Hospital, please.	Hm.
Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone.	You know Rainier Wolfcastle?
Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on.	He eats fifty dollars' worth of Power Sauce bars a day.
Huh?	Hm. Congratulations, sir.
I am?	You're gonna be the first man to climb the Murderhorn.
You? Did?	Son! Don't go up that mountain! You'll die up there! Just like I did!
If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!	I fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. 'Course folks were tougher in those days. I was jitterbuggin' that very night. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again.
Huh?... Wha ya?... Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain.	If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!
That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity.	Homer, you're the world's greatest hero. Do you owe it all to Power Sauce?
Well, yeah...	Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?
Oh, man, this is hard.	Remember our agreement. He can't fail.
Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced.	Shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?
Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb!	Wow! Look how far I climbed! And I'm not even tired!
So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own.	Frankly we don't care.
Shut up. You are so fired.	Then technically, shouldn't you go back down the mountain and start all over?
The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars.	Are you crazy? You'll never make it.
Hey, Deng Xiao-Ping died.	Wake up, Homer! Those bars are just junk. They're made of apple cores and Chinese newspapers.
Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out.	Homer, listen to me! Turn back now!
La la la la la la la la...	Air's getting thin, but I'm gonna make it. Woo! Getting lightheaded... Good -- no heavy head to carry. Wait! I'll just take that escalator!
La la la la la la la la la...	La la la la la la la la...
It just keeps going! I give up. You beat me, mountain!	I did it! I made it all the way to... Aw, crap!
At least I won't freeze to death.	It just keeps going! I give up. You beat me, mountain!
"Ew, Dad. ""Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio."""	"""Last entry. I have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. Worse still, that treacherous skunk Abe Simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."""
My Dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's Dad. Me.	"Ew, Dad. ""Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio."""
This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get.	My Dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's Dad. Me.
This is for you, son.	This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get.
Oh, Marge, I never thought you'd see me again.	Oh, Homie! You're alive!
Why don't you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there?	Didja make it to the top, Dad? Huh? Didja?
Aw, dammit!	All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off.
Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile.	Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. You're the coolest Dad ever.
'Mornin', Barney.	'Mornin' boys. Can't stop to chat. Time is money.
Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer.	Hey Dad, wake up.
Eh. Eh.	Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer.
Aha. There's some glue.	Eh. Eh.
Who is this?	Dad?
Museum? I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say?	It's Lisa. I just called to tell you how much I love you and can I take the bus to the museum?
Hmm. So you want to take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision...	Ahm... I wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. She said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room.
Two hundred dollars?! Isn't there any other way?	Well... if it would put your mind at ease, I could take a limousine. Although that would cost two hundred dollars...
Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus.	Hmm. I guess I could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea.
Atta girl. I love you, sweet --	Oh, all right.
My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus.	"Oh, what, this thing? I got it down at the museum. It's what the ancient Egyptians call a ""souvenir."""
MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire.	Alone?
Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter.	That never, uhh, happened, did it, Homer?
Lisa!	Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter.
Oh, where is she?	Lisa?! Lisa?! Li-sa?!
Has anyone seen my little girl?	Oh, where is she?
For God's sakes, my little girl is--	Has anyone seen my little girl?
Hello.	For God's sakes, my little girl is--
I am at work. This is what I do.	Hello.
Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot.	But--
Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns, sir.	Shouldn't you be at work right now?
Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?	Well then, get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are.
Lisa... Lisa...	Oh! Aw! Oh, great. Somebody stop that awful, awful man!
This is no good. I've got to get up higher.	Lisa... Lisa...
Give me all your balloons.	This is no good. I've got to get up higher.
I hope this works...	Give me all your balloons.
These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.	I hope this works...
Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!	Excuse me, ma'am? Uh, hello? Somebody? Anybody?
Stay there! I'll come down and save you!	Dad!
Lisa! Save me!	Stay there! I'll come down and save you!
Oh, no! I'm gonna go off the end of the --	Look out!
Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!	Dad, grab onto it!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Oww!	Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!
Nah, I'll just walk it off.	Are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did close on your head.
Don't ever say that.	I should have known I wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but I really wanted to see that exhibit. I'll never take another stupid risk like that again!
If I hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, I never would have found you.	What?
Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. And that's why I have so many adventures.	I guess...
Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?	Dad! You're headed for the river again!
I'm enjoying my life too much to care. And you should be too. So what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!	Dad, are you all right?
Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feeling stupid? I know I am.	See the Isis exhibit. But the museum's closed.
Just a little higher...	That shut her up.
Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.	Dad, I'm kind of scared.
Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.	Okay... Here goes.
Uh... not this exquisite.	Have you ever seen such exquisite Ushabtis?
Well, Daddy will figure it out.	Archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means.
Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further.	Oh! We can't touch it, Dad. It's behind a velvet rope! A velvet rope.
Oh, so now it's we, eh.	It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered the secret!
Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us.	Thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, Dad.
Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it.	It's kind of humbling, isn't it? The music we just heard might never be heard again.
It is? Well... that's a good song too. Do do do do-do do do...	Dad, that's the Old Spice song.
Run!	Do do do do-do / Do do do do-do / Do do do do do do do do.
Look, honey, I clipped on my tie all by myself.	Run!
Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge.	And look as handsome as the day we were married.
Hey, look what was in here. A program from that guy's funeral.	Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge.
Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?	You mean Frank Grimes?
But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, elegant place.	Yayyy!
You mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? Why was I not informed?	Ohhh, look, Homie. Our wedding cake.
Hey Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? Wee little parties?	Look at this little plastic couple. Mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future...
Gotcha!	I'm going to bed.
Another super year with a super lady. Good night, honey.	Gotcha!
You know, um, it is a special occasion...	Good night, Homie.
Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.	Yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the Casbah.
So, you gonna...	Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.
Oh. No. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to, uh...	Oh. Oh, did you want me to...?
I know, but let me get you started first.	No, no, no, I have my part in this, too, um...
Oh, sorry.	Homie, you got your, your elbow in...
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!	Mmm.
No, no. Don't do that.	Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Do you want me to?
I know, but I don't like it.	Well, we used to...
Ahh!	I know, but I don't like it.
He's the best boy!	Ooh! Who's a good boy?
Hey, Marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?	Oh yes he is! Yes he is!
I love that dog.	Oh, yeah. He's really special.
G'night.	I love him, too. G'night.
Hmm, that's queer.	G'night.
What?	Homer, don't look.
The food!	What?
Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?	The food!
Okay.	Someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. We can get a new one.
It was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. Plus I'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than I let on.	Okay.
Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.	When we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our Saturdays? Driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?
I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'.	Ooh. There's the turn!
Hmmm...	I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'.
When you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt.	That's my brass knee... Steel hip... That one's news to me.
Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.	Safe at last.
That was close!	Huh. Well, maybe they're in the media room.
At your service, milady.	Ohhh. My hero.
Cara mia...	At your service, milady.
No, no, honey. Maybe this will help.	Uh, Captain? Captain? I-I know we usually bury the treasure... but what if this time we use it to buy things? You know, uh, things we like.
Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast.	He put new electrical tape on the cushions.
Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all.	Can I come?
Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?	Oh, knock it off, you perverts.
If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it.	Oh, isn't it romantic? Doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see.
Um, no time like the present.	Should we get started?
Well, yeah, kinda...	Hm, something's not right. Does this bed feel lumpy to you?
Did that butter churn just move? 'Cause if it did...	Well, yeah, kinda...
Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.	Oh, my heart's beating like crazy.
There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I have a disgusting idea.	Y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on.
They didn't hear us in the sewing room.	Shh! They'll hear us.
Hello, everybody.	Exactly. Now there's nothing left out there but treasure.
Bart! Yes.	Hey, you're back. Did you rock the Casbah?
Awww... Eskimo kiss!	It's okay when you're in love. And married. To the sweetest guy in the world.
I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.	You don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?
Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!	Priceless like a mother's love, or the good kind of priceless?
It hasn't changed since that magical evening when I knocked you up.	Oh, this is so naughty. Coming back to our old love nest...
Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit.	Oh, we drank so much that night.
Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer.	Heh, heh. Yeah.
Oh, why can't they just play through?	We're trapped!
Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?	Who cares what it is? Let's monoxide it.
Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys.	'At's a shame. He had one day left till retirement.
Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--	We've gotta get home before someone sees us.
Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.	Okay!
Honey, my shoulders are separating.	Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.
Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should give ourselves up.	All right, men, those nudies are here somewhere. Fan out.
Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field day. There's only one thing left to do.	But think of the scandal.
Grab onto the handles, Marge.	Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field day. There's only one thing left to do.
Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time.	Oh Lord, my hot plate. I only had two payments left.
These have pleats...	Clothes! We're saved!
No, that was not the thing.	You mean this thing?
Thank you...	Hang on, Homie. I'm gonna try to set her down.
Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... Baby doll...?	Dear Lord, look at that blimp. He's hanging from a balloon.
Dads especially!	Kids, I want to explain about the stadium. Y'see, sometimes Moms and Dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other.
Scary ways. But we never intended it to end like that. With thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.	So they need to explore new ways to express their love.
Who's in the mood for miniature golf?	All those eyes, just leering and leering at us.
Can't you just write on your arm like I do?	Look, Dad, they've got every kind of paper! Looseleaf, graph, unlined, college-ruled!
Yo, Apu, gimme the usual.	No!
Hey, this hot dog tastes different.	"Yes, sir! One Kwik-E-Dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of ""Success"" magazine."
Uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus.	Yes, I just cleaned out the machine, sir, so the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.
People buy grease?	I'm so sorry, but I sold it all to the rendering plant.
Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!	Oh yes. They use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food...
Money in the bank.	Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!
Okay, this bacon's done.	Money in the bank.
And now for the profit taking.	Okay, this bacon's done.
Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.	Uh, Dad, I don't think the dog can handle any more bacon.
Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence.	Homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight.
No, through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!	With cans of grease?
Where do you think you're goin'?	Come on, Bart. The bus is here.
Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.	It's the first day of school.
Woo hoo!	Four pounds of grease... that comes tooo... sixty-three cents.
Yeah, but your Mom paid for that.	Dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars.
And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?	But doesn't she get her money from you?
Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.	And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?
Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives.	Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss.
Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way.	They only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... Oh, and get this, Mom, she drinks iced tea.
Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?	But, Dad...
Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.	When you want grease, go to the source: good old Krusty Burger.
All right. We'll try it your way.	I was thinking more of the deep fryer.
My God, you're greasy.	Can I help you, sir?
If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys.	Mom's gonna kill you.
Hey, what the...?	If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys.
Hey, hey, you're taking our grease!	Hey, what the...?
Hey, that's my shovel.	We run the grease racket in this town.
Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business.	Hello?
Oh, what's the point?	My poor Homie. Couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
Emus? Really? Oh, that's pretty crazy... Nah... I'd only fail just like I fail at everything.	You're taking me! You got that?! And it's gonna be a magical evening!
Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now. Aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm... You're priceless, Marge.	Hey, Dad, I've been thinking. What if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?
All right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer.	I'm free next weekend! There's plenty of Milhouse to go around.
Dear Lord, I know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if you help us steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the profits to charity.	All right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer.
All right, screw it. Let's roll.	Dad, he's not stupid.
Mmm... I knew I should have attached those somehow.	All right, screw it. Let's roll.
This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm.	I'll go.
Okay, turn on the suction.	Don't worry. This is the score we've been dreamin' about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.
It's not working.	Okay, turn on the suction.
Bringin' up the rear.	Where's the hose?
Oh, yeah.	Are you as excited as I am?
Well, here goes...	Oh, yeah.
And now we wait. So... is this your school?	Well, here goes...
Uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... Scotland.	Eek! -- I mean, ach! -- I mean, what are you doing here?
Uhh... North... Kilt... town?	Saints be praised! I'm from Scotland! Where do ye hail from?
Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!	No foolin'?! I'm from North Kilt-town! Do you know Angus MacCloud?
Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!	Not so fast, boy-o. Well, if it was up to me, I'd let ya go. But the lads have a temper... and they've been drinkin' all day.
Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults.	Uh... guys? Guys? The hose.
That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!	Hey, Luigi bringa you kids free pizza. Why you have to maka da fun, huh?
Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life!	Doctors say the life expectancy of the average man is now seventy-six point two years.
Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.	Ohhh, yeahhh.
Marge! I've wasted half my life.	Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a...	Sir, do you need a tow truck?
Okay, send the truck.	What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a...
No, I don't deserve sugar. I'm halfway to my grave, and I haven't accomplished anything. Oh, I am not looking forward to my funeral.	Oh, honey, don't eat that. Wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?
Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny.	Indubitably, old chum.
Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that.	Okay, but you've accomplished a lot. You've made me very happy.
I've wasted half my life, Marge. Do you know how many memories I have? Three! Standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. Thirty-eight years and that's all I have to show for it.	Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that.
Cold.	Hi, Dad. How was work?
Oh. I see you're having a party. I'll come back later.	Surprise!
Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong.	The kids and I want to show you all the great things you've done.
All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir.	There you are in outer space. That's pretty impressive.
No.	Remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
Hike.	Well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children.
Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?	Your family has asked me to take time out from my busy schedule to invite you to a very speciallll...
No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar.	That, too. He also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car.
Really? A restaurant? Well, now I don't know what to think.	It's true. I read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
Cut it out, boy!	Top of the world, ma!
Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.	Dad? What are you doin' here?
Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance.	Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.
De de de de de.	Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance.
And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers.	That's great, Dad.
"No, not this one. ""The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."" It's about pirates."	They're all about smugglers.
I think it's pretty obvious that I am.	Excuse me, are you a student at this school?
Go school!	I think it's pretty obvious that I am.
Not the way I quit. Ooh-who.	That doesn't sound like me. Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here's one that's even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph...	Not the way I quit. Ooh-who.
... And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was Alva. And he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. And...	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here's one that's even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph...
Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and...	Huh? Oh... uh... oh, nuts. I forgot. All I can think of now is Edison. I can't even remember where I work.
That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!	Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine.
... And then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. Some kind of scary telephone I guess. Or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.	That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!
Ohh, that's where you're wrong, Marge. He was a shameless self-promoter.	All right, already! Everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. Maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about Thomas Edison!
Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life! I need to be more like Thomas Edison!	Well, you're not Thomas Edison.
And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas!	Whatever.
From this day forward, I am an inventor!	And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas!
Well, I quit my job just like you said to.	Do us a favor. Invent yourself some underpants.
Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house.	I didn't tell you to quit your job.
At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him.	I'll get you, you fat lunatic!
Let's see now... inventions... inventions...	At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him.
What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do.	Something electrical might be good.
You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables.	Oh?
My files!	Homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer.
Uh, this isn't working. I've got to try a different approach.	My files!
Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.	You've started smoking, Dad?
Shutup.	Yeah. He invented stuff, too.
Okay.	Butt.
Uh-huh.	Booger.
A-- Wait a minute! These aren't exciting new products! You're not even trying. Okay, that's it. Both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves.	Uh-huh.
I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em.	Homer! You can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community.	Hm. I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food. I guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are.
You stay here and guard the sandwich.	Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community.
Look, I just want to know how to invent things. Tell me.	And these should give you the grounding you'll need in thermodynamics, hyper-mathematics, and of course microcalifragilistics.
You mean like an electric blanketmobile?	Well, all you have to do is think of things that people need, but which don't exist yet.
Hamburger earmuffs!	Possibleh. Or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it, like--
Thanks, sucker!	Uh, well, well... I suppose that... would... qualify, uh...
Okay, I have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind.	These babies'll be in the stores while he's still grappling with the pickle matrix.
"First, my All-Purpose Electric Hammer. ""For all your pounding needs."""	Okay, I have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind.
Ow!	"First, my All-Purpose Electric Hammer. ""For all your pounding needs."""
Probably needs to be more powerful.	Ow!
"Now, here's my ""Everything's Okay"" Alarm."	I will buy ten of those right now.
This will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.	"Now, here's my ""Everything's Okay"" Alarm."
It can't be turned off.	Turn it off, Homer.
But it does break easily. Now this next one's for the ladies. How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?	It can't be turned off.
And now you're ready for a night on the town.	That's why I invented this revolutionary makeup gun. It's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready. Close your eyes, Marge.
Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed.	"Homer, you've got it set on ""Whore."""
Oh, look what you did. Now I have to get my cold cream gun.	Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed.
Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone.	Dad, women won't like being shot in the face.
In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip.	Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone.
Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one.	You expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
Yes?	No, Bart. Homer... all these inventions, they're...
Yes? Yes? Yes?	They're not very...
What?	They're terrible.
But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.	I'm not saying you're a bad inventor. I'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. Or accept them as gifts.
All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father.	Do you mind?
Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff.	Homer! / Dad! / Look out!
Really? You think it's a good idea?	It could save lives!
I did it! I'm gonna be rich!	Me, too!
Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you.	I did it! I'm gonna be rich!
See? It's just a regular chair, but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your...	Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you.
AWDAMMIT!	See? It's just a regular chair, but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your...
I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster.	Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap.
It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.	If Edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart?
That chair might be the only one he made.	It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.
So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then I'll be an inventor!	So?
Aw, to hell with him!	But I thought you loved Edison.
Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon.	Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!
I borrowed your wallet!	Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon.
Oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like Thomas Edison, Jr. You know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. Oh, and later, he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm.	Man, I can't wait to smash that chair.
Now let's take care of business.	Ohh! / Well, now that I'd like to see. / Yes.
Outta the way. This is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!	Now let's take care of business.
Invent your way out of this, Edison.	Your electric hammer, maestro?
Look, son. Edison was just like me.	Invent your way out of this, Edison.
No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.	You mean the wild mood swings?
We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I can't destroy your work, my friend.	No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.
No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home...	Can I?
Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.	Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad.
Yay! / All right! / Woo-hoo! /	Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.
That's my Tommy.	...Authorities say the phony Pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth. In other news, Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of all time...is apparently still inventing, despite the notable handicap of being dead.
Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.	I gotta admit, Homer. You're taking this pretty well.
Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone!	Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.
"All right. One for ""resident""..."	Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone!
Well, that's it.	That's me!
I needed my power fix.	One stinkin' letter? Why'd you make us gather 'round like that?
Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward.	Yeah, Lis. She is a smart, sophisticated woman. Now let's hear more about that big, big reward.
Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo, go-carts! C'mon everybody, let's go.	One reward coming up. Ta-da!
Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!	Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo, go-carts! C'mon everybody, let's go.
Stand back and watch the pro.	Cram it, ma'am.
Nah. They mess up my hair.	Uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?
Ooh. Ball one.	Nah. They mess up my hair.
Ball two. This Bozo's gonna walk me.	Ooh. Ball one.
Hey!	Ball two. This Bozo's gonna walk me.
You're going down, you--	Hey!
Oh! Oh! Why you-- Hey you-- You better-- I'm gonna-- If you k--	You're going down, you--
I rolled up all the socks.	Right through the neck! Doesn't get any sweeter than that, Simpson. Savor the moment.
What's next?	I rolled up all the socks.
All right.	While I deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?
I hate folding sheets.	All right.
Well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. Where's Bart?	That's your underwear.
It's okay, Marge. I'll get him. BA-ART!	He's up in his room. Bart?
MILHOUSE!	No, no. I'm pretty sure he's with Milhouse.
TELL BART TO COME HOME!	What?
WHO'S NELSON?	I think he's at Nelson's!
All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer.	Oh, yes. And punish Lisa for lying to us.
And get a little something for yourself, sweetheart.	Better.
I'unno. Drug lab?	Mmm. What do you think he's doing up there?
Or reading comic books. What am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing.	Drug lab?!
Sure it didn't.	That never happened, Dad.
Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?	Hmm... it's starting to cool down. I'll bake another pie.
Why is this taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.	Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?
Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?	Actually, it took fifty-three hours.
I see a horn!	I see a neck!
Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur.	Man, those are some funky-lookin' birds.
That is one vicious baby bird.	Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur.
Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.	You're a lizard.
Stupid cards.	Let us roll.
The chair? How come they only do crucifixions during sweeps?	Thank you, Chickie-pies.
Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!	Dibs on the liver!
This is legal, right?	This is genuine human hair.
Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?	Ahhhhh. Hi, everybody!
Later, chickie-pie.	Ooooh-woo! Wow. If your fly weren't open, you'd look just like Roger Moore.
You sent me to the chair.	Ooh. Ooo-la-la Simp-son. Huh. What can I do for you and your new do?
I know you are, but what am I?	Snake? But you're dead.
It's hammer time, Snitchy.	No, no, noooooo!
Oh, my God!	... And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.
Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you.	Ah, morning, Homer. Ah, you're looking unusually focused this morning.
Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude.	Don't you get it? He swore he'd kill me too. I'm next!
There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.	Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude.
You are sooo dead.	Dad?
Come here, you little--	Nooo!
Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!	My school picture!!
But I look so youthful and hunky.	You've got to fight the hair, Dad!
The kid's gotta die.	But I look so youthful and hunky.
But I love my son.	The kid's gotta die.
More than a lush head of hair?	But I love my son.
Don't make me choose!	More than a lush head of hair?
I love you, son.	Nooooo!
I'll show you, hair!	Get off of me.
Idiot?! Why you... little...	Ow! That's my face, you idiot!
It wasn't me, it was the hair!	Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of Moe Szyslak and Apu Nahasa -- pasa -- Uh, just Moe, just Moe.
Going where?	Oh, Homer, you're not going as a hobo again?
Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...	Well, we're leaving. And remember, no Itchy and Scratchy. I better take these batteries just to be sure.
"Huh? Oh, okay... Let's see... ""pause,"" ""three,"" no ""fa-fa""..."	Dad, you gotta get us out of here! Use the remote!
Look at him go.	Hee hee hee hee. Look how cute they are.
Ohh... Ahh...	She's teething. Look... her very first baby tooth.
I just lost my appetite.	Oh, geez!
Wait, mine came back.	Me too.
I know how to cheer you up.	Wait, mine came back.
This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--	I know how to cheer you up.
Ooh!	This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--
Look, Marge! Maggie lost her baby legs!	I hear all.
All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...	Homer, do something! The ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!
Bad baby! Oh, she's entering the terrible twos, all right.	All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...
Hello-- Oh, great. Mormons.	"We'll return with ""How Dracula Got His Groove Back."""
Huh? What are you talking about?	Oh, Lord. I was hoping this day would never come.
You intergalactic hussy! How could you?! Was he better than me?	I guess I've been in denial. Homer... Kang is Maggie's father.
Well, we can't compete with that, but--	And now she must return home to Rigel 7, where she will be guaranteed a lucrative civil service job for life.
It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired.	Homer, how did it feel to learn your baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?
One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna !	Well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier... because we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in a soundproof booth where he can't hear us.
C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home.	Suckers.
Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream. I had a hat, and a tie with no pants on.	Dad! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
I promise you kids lots of things. That's what makes me such a good father.	Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you promised to take us to the lake.
No, that would make me a great father.	Actually, keeping promises would make you a good father.
Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to...	Yes, we'll go to the darn lake! Now go back to bed. It's four A.M.!
"""Magilla Gorilla, gorilla for sale..."" Hey, you shouldn'ta oughta taken my banana, Mr. Peebles."	Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to...
Screw this. Hang on, everyone. We're takin' the ol' Simpson shortcut.	Homer, your spine!
So long, suckers!	Whooa!
Eat my dust, suckers!	So long, suckers!
Mmmm. Ugh, pesticides! Carbomate, if I'm not mistaken. Yep, Carbomate.	Stop calling everyone suckers!
I see it.	Tree!
Well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies.	This is such a secluded area. I wonder who lives in that house?
Lower! Lower!	So, I suppose that's a hillbilly Jacuzzi?
"Yep. That's where they cook up their ""vittles."""	Lower! Lower!
Okay, remember where we parked.	Hey, here come the Simpsons. N-Now be careful, Homer. There's a fella in the sand right in front of ya...
Oh yeah, couldn't put it down.	There you go. And I assume you've read the boat safety manual.
C'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack.	Oh yeah, couldn't put it down.
Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me.	Uh sir, you can't operate a boat under the influence of alcohol.
Life jackets?	Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me.
Tow rope?	Check.
Skier?	Secure.
Here we go!	Ready.
Ooh, look at it go.	She's down.
Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!	I don't know... I think Dad might be a little heavy for parasailing.
Heads up. Comin' through. Look out! Hey, volley ball. Can I play later? Hi, Apu.	Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!
Higher!	Step on it, Mom. Dad's signaling that he wants to go higher.
Bye-bye, fishies! Higher! Higherrr!	Higher!
I'm soaring! Soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft! Higher, Marge! Higher!	Bye-bye, fishies! Higher! Higherrr!
Higher, I say! I want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! I want to look down on the clouds with contempt! I want to sneer at God's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh.	It won't go any --
Oh, this is not good.	There goes my turn.
Aw, nuts.	Oh, this is not good.
What? Oh, already?	Aw, nuts.
Sorry, lady. I know you. You're Kim Basinger	What the hell?!
Ohhh my God, I am such a huge, huge fan of yours, Miss Basinger.	It's Basinger.
Well, I am a married man...	Thanks. Listen, you think you could slide over a little?
So, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?	I'm Alec Baldwin. Could you get off me?
Wait! Tell me over breakfast. Who's for pancakes?	Well...
Oh, I don't want to be a bother. Anyway, what are you two big Hollywood stars doing in good ol' Springfield?	Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital, Mr. Simpson? You had an awful lot of glass in you.
Oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... Bethesda?	Hm, Sometimes we need to get away from Hollywood. L.A. is just so phony.
Yeah, tell you the truth, I'm not even sure.	What we really like here is the privacy. Most people don't even know where Springfield is.
A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses.	I'm gonna eat it later.
You shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the Gersh Agency. You should let me do your shopping. I know where I can get you some great muffins.	A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses.
Okay, fine. But I could do all kinds of stuff for you. I noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken.	No more muffins.
Please, Homer. C'mon, if you let me hang around a while, I can do all kinds of stuff for ya.	Yeah, I'm not sure we need an assistant, Mr. Simpson.
Yeah, you owe me that much.	I suppose we could give it a try.
Absolutely. If you promise to keep mine.	Will you promise to keep our secret?
I can't read.	Okay, what is it?
I recognized the logo.	But you just read that card from the Gersh Agency.
Nowhere famous.	We've been looking all over for you, Dad. Where did you land?
Gersh Agency.	Where'd you get that muffin?
Apu, I'm about to purchase some weird and fruity items, and I don't want any guff. First of all, I'll need the following mushrooms: portobello --	Gersh Agency.
Porcini --	Yes.
Chanterelle --	Right.
AAAnd Shiitake.	Uh-huh.
Nothing, nothing. I'm just broadening my horizons. Uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a Humvee?	Mister Simpson, these exotic items are suspiciously different from your usual order of beer and pork. What gives?
Ooo, me-ow.	When you win one, you can take care of it however you want.
I'll get it! I'll get it!	Ooo, me-ow.
Yes?	I'll get it! I'll get it!
Ron Howard?!	Hi, I'm Ron Howard.
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger?!	Yeah, I'm lookin' for Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Really? You giant stars consider me a friend? Well, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm somebody. Ronny, are you also my close friend?	Oh, that's just Homer. He's a new friend of ours.
It's called a Lawnmower. I invented it. You want one?	Do I smell vodka... and wheat grass?
Sure. We'll all stay.	Ooh, I'll have one of those, too. Hey, can I crash here tonight?
I'll do that! You go upstairs and have a beer.	"A cell phone? Last Thursday's ""Variety""?"
Kent Brockman. Please.	Oh, they don't come much bigger than that.
Well, you know me. I love animals. Beef, chicken, veal... if you're not part of the solution, Marge, you're part of the problem.	Kent Brockman. Please.
Imagine Films.	But that's not what P.E.T.A. stands--
And lift, and strain, and hy-per-extend, keep those knees rigid, jerk that lower back...	A, uh... division of, um... Homer-Co.
That's right, force it. Whip that neck.	Homer, I'm feeling some sharp pains in my neck.
Oh, there's that movie script I wrote. Where did you find it?	Um, does anybody know where this came from?
The important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. Either one of you. It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. Ron Howard's attached to direct.	On my pillow.
Well, he expressed an interest.	I am not!
Did too!	No, I didn't!
You lie!	I did not!
So you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?	Yeah, Homer, um, most movie scripts are 120 pages. This is only seventeen. Annnd several of the pages are just drawings of the time machine.
Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie.	I'm sorry, Homer.
I might have.	Oh, what? I suppose you've seen a bigger star?
Oh, I can't. I promised I wouldn't.	Come on, make with a name.
Who the hell are you?	Tell the people, Homer. They have a right to know about the celebrity summer house.
All right, I'm gonna let you guys in on something. But you've got to keep it much more secret than I did.	What do you care? I'm telling you what you want to hear.
Unbelievable?	Yess! In your freckled face, Howard!
Nothing, nothing. Good hustle.	What?
Uh-oh.	My God. The lemonade. Look at the lemonade!
I'm looking at you, Horshak.	Somebody must have told them we live here.
Okay, okay, it was me. I'm sorry I blew your secret. But you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. I just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. Reflected glory!	Homer, how could you?
But where will I bask?	Homer, you betrayed our confidence. I just don't think we can be friends anymore.
Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here.	Anywhere but here.
All right, I'll go. But the next time you want someone to remind you which brother is which, or smell your hair while you're sleeping, just remember, old Homer won't be here anymore.	Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here.
Oh, how could Alec and Kim just cut me out of their lives?	Throw your stones. It's nobody.
When Kim makes a Manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. And would it kill you to put some fennel in it?	Homer, you haven't touched your food.
Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day.	Alec Baldwin, wow. That is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. What was it like at their house?
Was it the dog from the Beethoven movies?	I washed the dog today.
Our dog isn't famous. And you kids aren't exactly John and Joan Cusack. And you. You couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. I'm about ready to ankle this family.	Of course not.
See? It's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. The only one who understands me is that guy who married Martha Raye.	"""Ankle""? ""Foccacia""? What are you talking about?"
Hmmm... She may not be famous, but she's right. Those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. I did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... And I've still got a car full of their crap. Crap, eh...?	Don't blame us, Dad. The celebrities are the ones who canned you.
Attention starstruck fools!	I never get tired of that.
Step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of Alec-and-Ron-and-Kim-arabilia.	Attention starstruck fools!
Only 5, no wait 10 dollars. You heard right, 20 dollars.	Step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of Alec-and-Ron-and-Kim-arabilia.
That's right, Mister Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin. Oh, and look at this. We can't even pay our bills and they're drinking Royal Crown Cola.	Hey, it's Alec Baldwin's medic-alert bracelet.
Oh, yeah? What have they ever done for you? When was the last time Barbra Streisand cleaned out your garage? And when it's time to do the dishes, where's Ray Bolger? I'll tell ya. Ray Bolger is lookin' out for Ray Bolger!	We love celebrities!
Why you little--!	Next...
Ooh, look at me! I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star! I'm so beautiful! I think I'm so great! I'm too important to take Homer to the Oscars.	I'm really looking forward to seeing Homer again. He always has the most interesting odors.
Gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-Museum-of-Hollywood-Jerks.	What the -- ?
Oh, I'll never outrun them in a museum!	What? It is personal. He's got our underpants.
No!	Pull over, you maniac!
Oh, God.	Not well. But I'll give it a shot.
Okay, I'll stop.	You killed Ron Howard!
Yes, I do.	Mr. Simpson, do you have anything to say for yourself?
I believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. If celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively.	Yes, I do.
In closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. And when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. Thank you, Your Honor.	I believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. If celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively.
"Well, I'll always have my crank calls. Hello, old lady from ""Titanic""? You stink!"	Woo hoo!
All righty, I'll just-- You stinkin' g--	Worthless old geezers.
But with college behind us, we'll need careers. And good ones.	I'll say.
Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future.	Or begging. I know a place that'll saw your legs off...
Oh, am I?	Now you're dreaming.
It's the job of tomorrow... today!	Of course. Nuclear power.
Well, that settles it. For all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... Line.	Really?
Nuclear power.	Nuclear power.
Pretty good, huh?	Hey!
Well, there were script problems from day one.	I didn't quite get the point of it, Dad. Why would Lenny want someone to saw his legs off?
That was the problem. The important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, I'm finally getting some decent parts.	Didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
I didn't choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits.	You're joining the Screen Actor's Guild?
Good. Good.	Fat Guy Number Three?
"You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the ""J"" stand for?"	Hey, what the heck is your middle name, anyway?
But I can't ask Mom. She's on the run from the law.	It was your mother's job to name ya and love ya and such. I was mainly in it for the spanking.
No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.	You might as well. You already made up a phony film credit.
Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. The point is, I'm a grown man, and I deserve a middle name.	You lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.	Hmm... I know where we might find your missing moniker. It's a bit of a drive, but on the way we can have a nice father son chat.
Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations.	This is the hippie commune your mother ran off to when life with me became a living hell.
Oww... ch.	Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations.
You went to Woodstock?	Is that... Abe Simpson? Geez, man, we haven't seen you since Woodstock.
Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat.	Oh, Homer J., how do you keep your hair so rich and full?
Wow, I could have lived like that?	Homer J., will you teach us to make love?
Ohh, my mother painted that for me?	Aaanyway, I-I still think about her every time I walk by that mural she painted.
"Oh, my God! My middle name is right behind that shrub. I'll finally know what ""J"" stands for! From this moment forth, I will be known as Homer...Jay Simpson. It's so beautiful. What a magical gift for my mother to leave me."	Ohh, my mother painted that for me?
I'll treasure this poncho forever.	She also left her old poncho.
My head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. I'll do it!	Just lyin' around... never workin'... without a care in...
I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!	Whuh?
Get off, you stupid dog!	I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!
Bummer... love-in... Dean Rusk... By George I've got it!	Now I know how Dean Rusk feels. G'night everybody!
Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures.	Dad, do you mind? Your feet are really close to my potato.
No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing.	Homer, excuse yourself.
Why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? Marge, you've got too many hang-ups. Like the whole shaving trip. C'mon, I want to see those legs all furry and gross.	And that poncho is filthy! Let me dry-clean it for you.
"Well, at least lose the bra. Free the ""Springfield Two,"" Marge! Free the ""Springfield Two!"""	I see...
C'mon, Maude. The human wang is a beautiful thing.	My eyes have been soiled!
Okay, okay. Narc.	Homer, for God sakes, put your poncho on!
Heads up!	Okay, okay. Narc.
Right on.	My man! You've gone granola.
That was cool. Think I'll stick around. We've got everything we need right here. Good times, sunshine, free love...	Join the hack.
Work!? But you're hippies!	Okay, time to get back to work.
What is this place?	Time is money, man.
Profits, profits, profits! What kinda hippies are you? Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave.	We grow our own vegetables and process them right here. And we give half the profits to war orphans.
Oh, yeah? When's the last time you freaked out the establishment? You guys are total sellouts.	W-We're just trying to pay the bills, Homer. I mean, we're still hippies at heart.
Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. C'mon, where's your freak bus?	Wait. Don't you work for a nuclear power plant?
A Saturn?	I drive a Saturn.
Fine. I guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.	Yeah, an old-time freak-out sounds tempting, Homer. But we've got a big order to fill.
Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!	Hey, we'll call it a business trip and write off the mileage.
Ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. I brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.	Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!
Hey square, expand your mind! The doors of perception are open for business.	Can you turn that down just a little?
Never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!	Thanks for the tip, Homer.
Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!	Weirdos!
What's in your brand new bag, mama?	Oh, Lord.
Marge. Not in front of the hippies.	Uh, it's that pair of Dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?
Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!	Oh, please God, don't let them come in here.
Woo hoo!	Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!
No, no, no. Marge was definitely freaked out.	That was fun. I don't know if we actually freaked anyone out, but --
Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?	Our entire shipment is ruined!
I'm sensing some negative vibes here. But I promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.	The only people who are going be freaked out are our stockholders.
Yes, b-b-but the poncho...	There won't be any more freak-outs! You're not a hippie, and you never were!
B-b-but the poncho...	Please, Homer, just leave us alone.
Uh-oh.	B-b-but the poncho...
Aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. I just don't have the discipline to be a hippie.	And in business news, Groovy Grove Juice Corporation has announced it will miss delivery on its third quarter shipment. A spokesman attributed the production shutdown to a half-witted oaf.
Perhaps in time.	Ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?
Aww, you're just saying that.	Aw, cheer up, Dad. You make a great hippie.
Well, I do walk through pretty much anything... Ohh, you kids are sweet.	And the soles of your feet are jet black.
That's it! Somehow!	I know you feel bad about the juice incident, but I'm sure you can make up for it somehow.
Sleep gentle hippies, sleep. Let old Homer Jay set things right.	That's it! Somehow!
Good morning, Starshine. Seth.	Sleep gentle hippies, sleep. Let old Homer Jay set things right.
I picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. Your business is saved!	W-What happened to our crops?
Heh. That's what I thought at first. But then I found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.	But there weren't enough vegetables left to fill that order.
Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!	"Homer, those were our ""personal vegetables."""
Not so fast, Pig! We're making a stand. A freaky stand! You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!	Officer, please, we can explain...
"Seth, Munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""UPTOWN GIRL / SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN HER WHITE-BREAD WORLD..."" Come on, guys... UPTOWN GIRL..."	Oh, for the love of... there. Now, let's crack some skulls.
Look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man.	Forget the clubs. Just shoot him.
Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. Yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on.	Look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man.
Freedom...	Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. Yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on.
Love...	Freedom...
And peace.	Love...
Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?	I'm a doctor, not a gardener.
Don't make me come up there!	MMMennnn...onite minister will be giving a guest sermon next Sunday. Go in peace. Aaaa--
Woo hoo!	...men.
Hang in there, son. I'm taking us out for our traditional Sunday brunch.	"No, no one's ""going Catholic."" Three children is enough, thank you."
He zinged you, Marge.	Hang in there, son. I'm taking us out for our traditional Sunday brunch.
Brunch is served!	He zinged you, Marge.
Why? We're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free.	I feel guilty coming here every Sunday and never actually buying anything.
Cherry Garcia... Honey Bono... Desmond Tutti Fruitti... Lisa, help Daddy find some normal flavors.	If you're gonna get snippy, I'll take my business elsewhere.
Nooo, nothing made of dead guys. What's in the back?	Candy Warhol? Xavier Nougat?
Hurry up. My hands are getting cold.	Nooo, nothing made of dead guys. What's in the back?
Ooooh.	Oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress.
Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that.	Those are eight dollars a pound, sport.
Unless...	Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that.
I tell ya, I'm a financial genius. I buy an eight-dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty-dollar lobster, and eat the profits.	Unless...
I'm way ahead of you.	Lobsters need salt water.
Hold on. I'm still fine-tuning.	Dad! The fish!
Uh-oh.	Hold on. I'm still fine-tuning.
Perfect.	Uh-oh.
No problem. I picked some up at the store.	Ohh, you don't sound so good. We'd better get you some cold medicine.
Nothing's too good for my one and only.	Oh, Homie, you made breakfast.
Eat, eat! You're nothing but skin and bones.	Nothing's too good for my one and only.
Okay, together, we weigh three hundred pounds. According to my driver's license, I weigh 140 pounds.	We'll see about that, mate.
That means that you weigh... One hundred and sixty pounds! Oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!	Okay, together, we weigh three hundred pounds. According to my driver's license, I weigh 140 pounds.
Good news, my delicious friend! You're going to be a free-range lobster.	Come here ye slippery rascals.
C'mon, boy, dig in. They'll give you a big, strong thorax.	Good news, my delicious friend! You're going to be a free-range lobster.
Aw, look at him cower, just like the boy. I can't stay mad at such a helpless little mammal.	C'mon, boy, dig in. They'll give you a big, strong thorax.
Oh, I'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!	Aw, look at him cower, just like the boy. I can't stay mad at such a helpless little mammal.
Take that, Pinchy.	Oh, I'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!
Well, I guess this is it, ol' pal. This is your big day.	Ooh, so plump and juicy. He's gonna boil up nicely.
Uh...	The water's boiling! Quick, chuck him in!
Okay...	Come on! Chuck him in!
But Marge, look at the little guy!	Let's go! In the pot. In the pot.
Feel that, Marge? He likes you!	He looks like an ordinary... ow! Son of a--!
And now for the main course...	Feel that, Marge? He likes you!
Steamed Maine cabbages!	And now for the main course...
We're not eating Mr. Pinchy. He's part of the family now.	Pardon me for asking, but where the hell's my stupid lobster?
Pinchy, I made you some risotto.	We're not eating Mr. Pinchy. He's part of the family now.
What's your problem, Veggie? You don't even eat lobster.	Daddd...
Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?	Oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. By the way, I oiled the hinge on your diary.
That's my girl!	Uh, I am sick of everyone being so proud of me!
Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look.	Oh, thank God! Now let's talk rustproofing. These Coleco's will rust up on you like that. Ah-- Shut up, Gil. Close the deal. Close the deal.
Here's a little playmate for you.	Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look.
Hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. What's wrong with you?	Here's a little playmate for you.
Wooo!!	And now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in educational disbursement: State Comptroller Atkins.
Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath.	Who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!	Hey, what smells so good?
Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy.	Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
Oh God, that's tasty. I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy this. Ohhh, Pinchy!	Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy.
Hey, I'm trying to drive here!	Hip hip--
Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.	"Hey, Dad, that light says, ""Check Engine."""
There, problem solved.	Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.
Relax, she just needs a little lovin'.	Oh, come on.
Come on, come on, come on. Start, damn you. Start!	Aw, they remembered my birthday.
It's because they're stupid, that's why. That's why everybody does everything.	Because they discovered gold right over there--
Three minutes?	Founded by prostitutes in 1849, and serviced by prostitute express riders who could bring in a fresh prostitute from St. Joe in three days, Bloodbath Gulch quickly became known as a place where a trail hand could spend a month's pay in three minutes.
Do we have to listen to you?	Uh, yes, sir?
I'm done.	Oh, well... no, you don't... but if you have any interest in history...
Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!	Wow! Have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?
Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!	First of all, I'm not a robot. And second, I got this metal ass in 'Nam, defending this country for lazy jerks like you. Now, what'll you have, partner?
Duh.	You can get drunk when we get home.
What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody kill somebody!	Let's forget this whole thing happened.
But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick.	Homer!
"Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, ""Inside the Actor's Studio."" Tonight it's F. Murray Abraham."	Can I go to the bathroom before we leave?
F. Murray Abraham.	But I really need to--
Can't stop now. We're making great time.	There's a rest area. Pull over.
What are you, an animal?	Can I go behind a tree?
"Whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."	What are you, an animal?
We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more times over the horizon.	Please go back! You can make it my birthday present.
You just sit back and relax. I'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.	But I might explode.
Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way.	Oh, no!
Excuse me, doctor. I think I know a little something about medicine...	Uh, actually, his kidneys were fine yesterday when he had his annual checkup.
So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?	Homer, with all due respect, this x-ray reveals a textbook kidney blow-out -- which would explain those loud pops you heard.
Oh, I blame myself for this.	I'm amazed you're alive now.
C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can do to help my dad.	Oh, I blame myself for this.
A kidney? Okay, fine.	Well, you could give him a kidney.
"I said ""fine."" What is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"	You see, the waiting list for a kidney is very long and...
Pork chops, sloppy joes, hot dogs, and pork chops?	Hmm, I'll take the left one -- it's good and springy. Though the right one's not without its charm.
Well now that's what I always thought, but somehow...	Besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you.
"""Apes-A-Poppin'!"" Oooh, the airline version!"	"Check it out, Dad. I rented all your favorite gorilla movies. ""Gorilla Squadron,"" ""Gorilla Island VI,""..."
Nothing's too good for me.	Can I fluff your pillow?
Ahhh. I'm the luckiest man in the world, now that Lou Gehrig's dead.	Nothing's too good for me.
It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure.	Well, I gotta hand it to you, Homer. You're really brave to go through with this operation.
Really? You think it's dangerous?	Nah, nah, no. Makin' polenta, that's a procedure. You're talkin' about deadly, life-threatening surgery, here.
Procedure. Deadly procedure.	Oh, yeah. And, and even if you survive the operation --
Now you're just tryin' to scare me.	Whatever. The point is, with only one kidney, you won't be able to drink yourself stupid no more.
But I don't want that.	Plus they'll put you on one of those organ donor sucker lists. Everybody who wants an eyeball or a spine or a vestigial tail will be after you.
Yeah, I guess.	Listen, I'm just gonna get right to the point, here. Can I have your buttocks? I mean, if you die. They look pretty comfortable.
Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes!	And, uh, are those your original lips?
Marge, I've been thinking. What if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, I gave Grampa that artificial kidney I invented?	Oh yeah, that would look so good on me.
But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine.	Oh, Homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it.
I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.	I love you, son.
You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?	Well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel.
Blow up the hospital.	Ohh, anything, sweetheart.
That's my girl.	Well... I said I'd do it, so I guess I'll have to.
Liability waiver?	Dr. Martins to podiatry.
Yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... I don't usually sign stuff like that.	Don't read it. Just sign it.
Oh.	It simply says you won't hold us responsible if you die as a result of gross negligence. It's a standard form.
I love you, Dad.	I love you, son.
I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.	Thank you.
Even those guys look too civilized for me.	I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not like those mean old mountains. I hate them so much.	Even those guys look too civilized for me.
Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.	I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not like those mean old mountains. I hate them so much.
Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best.	Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
Um, can I be a mate on your ship? Preferably First Mate.	Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best.
Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy.	Well, if you look closely, you'll see this is a taffy shop shaped like a ship.
A tramp steamer! That's perfect!	Come back, doctor.
Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If you don't have a captain, I could be that.	A tramp steamer! That's perfect!
I've been on that one. The taffy shop.	Arr, what other ships have ye been on?
"The name on the back says ""Honeybunch."""	"Welcome aboard ""The Ship Of Lost Souls""."
Well, actually, you did...	Arr, I've been meaning to paint over that. Now come and meet the rest of the damned. Did I mention they're lost souls?
Say, who are you guys?	Ahh, another lost soul has joined our world-weary ensemble.
H-Heyy, let me off this thing.	Who are we? No one. Where are we sailing? Nowhere. Do we even exist? Who knows?
Whew.	Oh, don't listen to him. We exist all right.
Forget what?	We wander the seven seas, trying to forget.
Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson. And I guess it is here, too. I promised my Dad one of my kidneys, but I chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed.	Come, stranger, join our circle of infamy. Tell us your story of en-nui.
Well, yeah, I know...	I stole this accordion from a blind monkey, but you... you disgust even me.
Even the sea won't forgive me.	That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step.	We make a great team, son.
All right, this is it. No more living in shame. I'm going to show my family the kind of man I really am.	Hey!
All right, I'm gonna...	All right, this is it. No more living in shame. I'm going to show my family the kind of man I really am.
No you're not, Dad.	Oh, who'm I kiddin'? I'm a goner.
I'm sorry, Dad. The way I behaved was shameful. I guess fear made me run away. But love made me come back.	Son!
Boy, that...	Oh, dear.
Ow!	Boy, that...
I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad must be dead by now. When I get better, and after I've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave...	Try not to move, Dad. You swallowed a lot of motor oil.
It's a miracle! You recovered!	Oh! Boy, I shouldn'ta done that.
What? What? Hey!	It's a miracle! You recovered!
You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--	While we were setting your broken bones and putting your blood back in, we helped ourselves to a kidney and gave it to your father.
Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug.	Yes. You've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs.
I don't need two kidneys. I have everything I need right here...	Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug.
Hmmm...	I don't need two kidneys. I have everything I need right here...
Yesss, tickling.	Dad, you're tickling me.
Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial.	We'll return for the remainder of the conclusion after these messages.
Well, beats work.	Remember, it's BI-MON-SCI-FI-CON. Be there and be square!
Nooooooooooo!	As you can see, you stand to save up to seventeen cents a month over the more dependable providers...
You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance!	/ Yeah! / Star Wars!
Neeerrrds!	That swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!
Get out of there!	Neeerrrds!
Mr. Hamill, Mr. Mayor, come on!	Get out of there!
Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' you out of here!	Who are you?
Never!	I can't, Homer. I twisted my ankle. You guys go on without me!
Follow me.	Never!
Oh, how was I supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?	Follow me.
Forget Maggie! She's gone!	Oh, my God. Someone has to go back in for Maggie!
Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle.	Wow, that was close. Well, thanks a lot, Homer.
Woo hoo!	I'll tell you who. Him!
"I said, ""woo hoo."""	Homer, I don't think you were listening to what he just--
Even during Ramadan?	As a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to your pro-tectee. Not to your family. Not to your country. Not to Moohamed.
Wha?	These melons represent your pro-tectees. Throughout this course, you will pro-tect your personal melon as if it was paying your salary.
Nooo!	Okay, listen up! My goal is to assassinate that watermelon. Your job is to take the bullet. Go! Go! Go! Go! Pow!
Clear!	"""AND I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOOOUUU!..."" Ha!"
The pig is in the poke.	Oh, for Pete's sake.
Look out, Marge! Cat!	You know, I really don't care for that code name.
Hold it! What's your clearance?	I know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?
Access denied.	We just want to get a snack.
They'll be fine in half an hour.	Homer! I don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.
Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well...	That's not the point. And another thing. I asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir.	Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well...
Semi-imported. Keep 'em comin'.	Heh. Here's a couple of Düffenbraus, on the house, of course.
... And after Moe's, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for...	Eh, you should see the hospital.
Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time.	"That ""change"" was a bribe."
"So, how'd you get the nickname ""Legs""?"	Thank you, Fat Tony. However, in the future, I would prefer a nondescript briefcase to the sack with a dollar sign on it.
Oooh, mini-cannoli!	Well, that's an interesting story. It seems President Kennedy's father...
Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here!	Oooh, mini-cannoli!
Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.	Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here!
Oh! Crap on a crutch!	Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.
They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats!	Oh! Crap on a crutch!
Oh, get that away from me!	Dad! What a nice surprise.
Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever.	Oh, get that away from me!
Go nuts.	Can I still drink it?
You... monster! How could you do that to the children?!	All right!
And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!	Those wacky gangsters. What are you gonna do?
"Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay calm. I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and..."	Okay, we'll call it even.
His corpse is climbing the building!	Help! Help!
A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.	I'm alive, you idiot! Pull me in!
You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death.	But the gangsters will kill me.
Shake on it?	All right! All right, I promise.
Relax, you're in good hands. Now come on, I'll pull you up.	Shake on it?
Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you gonna do? Call your Godfather? Huh? Ooh, Godfather. Break it down!	I am not so much disappointed as I am blinded with rage.
Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail. Well, I'm off to work.	Aren't you scared, Dad? I mean, if I were Fat Tony, and God willing someday I will be, I'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder.
It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me. Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?	You're guarding the mayor tonight? After Fat Tony swore revenge?
What? There's nothing to worry about.	Homer!
All right, fine. I'll take a cab.	What? There's nothing to worry about.
Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?	Homer, I'm, uh, not sure it's wise to go out right now. I was thinking of a quiet evening at home with the, uh... wife.
You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters.	No, no, I truly do want to stay home with the... wife.
Uh, excuse me...	You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters.
Do you have a table for the mayor?	Nnyyeeeeeesss?
Why do you talk that way?	Nnyyeeeeeesss.
Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?!	"Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than ""Othello"" with Peter Marshall."
All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after--	Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?!
Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this--	Please, I am only here as a devotee of the lively arts. But I do have something for the mayor that perhaps you could deliver.
Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.	You moron! That's the Kiss of Death!
Nooooooooo!!!	Ah, au gratin potatoes, that's a quality side.
Potatoes are clean. The poison must be in the steak.	Nooooooooo!!!
Yesss! Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on -- Aw, crap.	"""... GUYS AND DOLLS. WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF CRAZY GUYS AND DOLLS. OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, GUYS AND DOLLS...!"" ""AND OH THOSE DOLLS! WE'RE DANCING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH! AND GAMBLING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH!"""
That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?	But I'm just here to kill... Wha--
"I think I saw him in ""Rent,"" or ""Stomp,"" or ""Clomp,"" or some piece of crap."	He looks awfully familiar.
Look out!	Show's over, Mayor!
Gimme that knife!	Look out!
The force?!	Homer... use... the forrr...
Oh.	The forks... use the forks...!
Oh, Fat Tony.	Oh.
Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent.	I checked with the doctor. He said Mayor Quimby's gonna be fine... and I was electric as Nathan Detroit. What did you think of me?
Really? Would you say I was magnetic?	Ohh... cheer up, Homer. I think you made a great bodyguard.
Aww...	Absolutely.
Get out of the way you--	Oh, wait, here it is.
Oh, I can explain that. You see...	I'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
Don Rickles zinged you, Marge.	Hockey puuuuucks...
Eat my dust, dust!	Dust!!!
Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week.	We'd better stop and get the car washed.
Really? You think I should get it washed?	Hey, Homer. Car's kinda dirty.
Hey, that's great.	You listen to your friends, but you never listen to me.
Wuss rock?	No...
Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires?	That's it.
Hey! How did Churchy La Femme get half price?	Five dollars, please.
Senior citizen? Flanders?	Senior citizen's discount.
Well, we'll see about that.	Senior citizen? Flanders?
"I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, ""Saint Flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!"	Now we're going to pass this around a second time. Brother Ned, if you'll do the honors.
That's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. How, you ask? With a phony senior discount card!	/ What's he talking about? / What's he saying? / Who is he? / etc.
Did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?	Well, that's not quite true--
Now I'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...	Well, I did, but--
And you are how old?	Well, yes.
You mean that one with the red paint?	You've never licked maple syrup off your lover's stomach?
Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life.	No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it!
All right, Bart!	Rod, call Doctor Stein.
Fire in the hole!	All right, Bart!
Okay, no more gasoline.	Fire in the hole!
Full power!	Okay, no more gasoline.
You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!	Never a dull moment, huh, Homer?
Well, well, well. So flawless Flanders needs help from stinky-pants Simpson.	Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun.
Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee.	Yeah, I, I guess I do.
Wellity, wellity, wellity...	How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?
Let's do it.	Stop that! Will you help me or not?
Eh, the Missus will clean that up.	So what about all this meat?
First of all, I get five dollars a day plus expenses.	Now it's Marge's time to shine!
And I'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here.	Seems fair.
Well that's unfortunate. It really is.	Of course I... Oh, my stars! I can't do that.
Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program.	All right.
One day soon I will come for you, and then the game will begin. Could be in the middle of the night. It could be when you least expect it. Or whatever's good for you. I don't care.	So, what happens next?
Gimme that!	Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence.
That's your problem. You're living up here.	Gimme that!
You gotta live down here.	That's your problem. You're living up here.
In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this.	You gotta live down here.
We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino!	In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this.
You mean Lisa?	We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino!
Oh yeah, right.	Homer, they blew that up yesterday.
Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction.	Oh yeah, right.
"""Nobody's goin' to take my Ned / I'll teach him to have fu-un / Ooh, he's a Flanders machine..."""	Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction.
Relax, I called her from the gas station.	Ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. I'd better call Maude and tell her where I am.
Sucker.	Thanks, buddy.
I don't think so.	Oh, the lights, the noise, the letter X -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. I'm overstimulated! I gotta get out of this town!
I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.	I don't think so.
Hey! Lance Murdock!	Help me! My daughter's not talented!
He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death.	If he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!	And now, the indestructible Lance Murdock will jump his SuiCycle over an audience member. And he'll do it while attempting to open a locked safe on his head. Any volunteers?
Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?	No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn't rocket science.	Uh, yeah, paint. Now, it's of critical importance that you don't--
Bo-ring.	Well, actually, there are several rockets mounted to the--
Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer!	Okay, he's cleared the ring of fire! Past the ring of ice! Over the dog doo stick! He's cracked the safe!
Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss.	God Homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. Rumba! Yea, I was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered.
Let's see... what's Marge's birthday? Barney is July fifteenth, same as Lassie's, so Marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. Flanders, what's your birthday?	Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss.
Seven, eh?	Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--
Way to go, Flanders. The Bible's finally pulling its weight. Got any more holy numbers?	Seven a winner.
"""One betting disk please."" Watch and learn."	Oh, righty-o. One betting disk please.
Well, there you go. Now how 'bout a drink?	Aaand, fourteen black.
Oh, that. That can be treated with our good friend alcohol. You might want to write that down. Where the hell's your notebook?	Oh no. I-I mean common sense.
Oh, never mind. Just pay attention.	You threw it out the...
Slave girl? Oh, slave girl?	Oh, never mind. Just pay attention.
Whuh?	More libations, my imperial conquerors?
Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please.	More booze?
And for you, Ned?	Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please.
Welcome to my world.	Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing!
The what now?	Oh, I did it! I conquered my fears and I made up for a lot of lost livin'. And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson program.
Well, of course a-- Who are you?	Well, it's about time you two woke up.
Eeech.	Here comes that vomit again.
Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. Okay, you're saying that Ned and me married you two?	Eeech.
Ned, no! Think of your wives!	Mm-hm, I'm workin' on that.
Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. We would remember if we got married.	Ned, no! Think of your wives!
Ahh, precious memories.	Take a look at this.
What did you call me?	And do you, Homer, take this cocktail waitress you just met to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Sure. Sock it to me, baby.	Do you want to get married? Married!
We are so dead.	By the power vested in me by the Chicago Outfit, I now pronounce you husbands and wives.
Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. But first, I'm afraid we have some bad news. The waffle bar is closed. I'm sorry. I'm so very--	We are so dead.
But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be.	You two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had, and we're not giving you up without a fight.
Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie.	Ginger's my wife.
Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.	Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?
I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages.	What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!
Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig...	I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages.
Ooh, a friendly bee.	I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping.
Ow!	Ooh, a friendly bee.
Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outta this, Ned.	Ow!
Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. The program is rock solid. The program is sound.	Well, do something! This is all your fault. You and your stupid program.
Oh, those awful women want their omelettes.	Yoohoo.
Ginger throws Ned a kiss.	Oh, those awful women want their omelettes.
The Moody Blues!	Your behavior is.. is unconscionable!
What if we switched wives? Would that help?	I want fatty.
Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.	For the last time, no!
So long, su--	Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.
But Amber, I can change!	We found some guys who know how to treat a woman.
All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and Maude. We were out buying them fabulous gifts...	Will you shut up?
Because we love them, Jackass.	What's the occasion?
Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships...	Because we love them, Jackass.
You're right, you're right. Fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. They gang-probed you, while I discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved America.	Homer!
Would you rather tell Maude the truth?	Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?
Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you.	What did the aliens look like?
Hello, little birdie.	Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you.
Boooo!	I am Dennis Conroy, and heeere come your Isotopes!
Oh, stupid Isotopes. Hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!	... Smash Diggins and Fishbone Walker. Lucky for us, they were sent down from the majors for drug violations.
Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything.	Why do you hate the Isotopes so much, Dad?
Especially me.	Even you?
I'm going to warm up the car.	That's a rotator cuff. His career's over.
And it sucked!	But there's only been one pitch!
"""HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."""	Bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth, and it's do or die.
NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.	Good hustle, kid.
So, who won? The losers?	NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.
Losers.	No, they lost.
You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens.	With a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs.
What's the hubub? Did Moe finally blow his brains out?	Homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves?
Shut it off. They're losers.	Quiet! We're watchin' the Isotopes!
Championship?	Now we're in the championship game.
Wooooo! 'Topes ruuuule!	Championship?
Oh, it's a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... We did it, baby! Wooooo! Woooooo!	Well, here's a die-hard fan. Sir, your beloved Isotopes are about to make history. Any thoughts?
They lost? Those losers!	The inspiring words of a fan who'll always root, root, root for the home team, even if they lose this ga--
Woo! Not over! Wooooo!	No, no, no, the game's not over --
Woo! Rumaki!	Nobody touched my rumaki.
Isotoooopes! Wooo!	Woo! Rumaki!
Hey, a baseball field! Batter up!	Isotopes!
Touchdown!	Hey, who's on first?!
Safe!	Slide!
Whoop! Careful.	WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS / WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS / YOU GOT MUD ON YOUR FACE / BIG DISGRACE...
Last night?	Wow, you look really hungover, Dad. What did you do last night?
Hello, big Maggie.	Last night?
Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo--	Whoa / Curfew?
Oh, my God! Look what those rotten kids did to my car!	Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo--
That was cold-blooded, Marge.	Sure you do. You have the right to remain silent.
Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse...	But it's not fair. Adults always blame kids for everything!
Not until you're older, son.	What about adultery?
Kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! And they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! So-- Oh, right. Sorry.	And here we are, locked inside.
Marge, kite.	Meh.
"So, Marge, ready for another episode of ""Don't Go There""?"	Two hundred channels and nothing but cats.
Okay, whatever takes my mind off my life.	"I'm tired of that show. But I've been hearing good things about ""Talk to the Hand."" Tom Shales says the writing ""snaps, crackles and pops."""
Well, turn something on. I'm starting to think.	Hey, look what I found. Grampa's old radio. Oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?
Bo-ring. Go back to that infamy guy.	We Know All Your Secrets.
I have a problem.	Oh, Homer...
Well, at least they've already done me.	Tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. Because we'll be revealing embarrassing secrets about Springfield's other adults.
Speak for yourself! Bart, get down here! I'm gonna spank you back to the Stone Age!	All right, you kids come down now. We promise we won't kill ya.
Perfect.	Well, you kids are always disobeying them!
YEAH! / YOU'RE ONLY HERE 'CAUSE MARGE FORGOT HER PILL.	KIDS! / YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN, NOW WE'VE HAD OUR FILL.
Oh yeah? What can you old people do to us?	We're gonna teach all of you rugrats a lesson!
Pfft. It wouldn't have made a difference.	You really should have voted, Homer.
Wow, a Val-U-Qual coupon book!	Happy Birthday, Dad.
Let's see. Ten percent off carpet cleaning. Ten! Two pizzas for the price of one at Doughy's.	Wow, a Val-U-Qual coupon book!
Yeah, but there's two!	Doughy's has terrible pizza.
Oh, Marge. That's just a trick to get you in there so they can cure your foot pain.	"Oooh, ""Free foot pain analysis?"""
See ya, kids. Me and my Val-U-Qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! I'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and I'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic.	I guess.
Do you like piña colonics / And getting caught in the rain...	Um, Dad...
Passing out in the ocean...	It is to me.
Now this wheel balancing is free, right?	Passing out in the ocean...
They won't?	Oh, you betcha... absolutely... eh-- Uh-oh, oh, oh, wait a minute. These tires won't take a balance.
No.	Nah. Nah. No. You hear that clunk?
Really?	Well, that tells me you need four new tires.
Oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?	Yeah. Legally, I can't even let you drive out of here on these.
No! Wait! This is all my fault! Oh, if I could only turn back the clock and buy four new tires...	Uh, that's it. You're fired!
Six with the tip.	Oh, I know that look. You came in for the free wheel balance and now it's costing you five hundred Simoleans.
Stem lube. Even I didn't fall for that... Although winter is coming...	Hey, you got off easy. I just came in to use the phone and they got me for the whole Road King package. Alignment, shocks, Armour All, stem lube...
Hey, I know you. We were in the same pyramid scheme.	"Man, we are a couple of Grade ""A"" suckers. Wally Kogen."
Yeah. I'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.	"Oh, don't remind me. ""Friends Helping Friends,"" my ass. Say, you wanna grab a beer while we're waiting?"
Me? Nah. Unless there's a coupon for it. Nah.	Yeah, how 'bout that Super Bowl? You goin' this year?
Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?	We've got a charter bus goin' down to the game. You help us fill it, you can ride for free.
Me?!	You!
Sorry.	Yeah, you. Get your hand off my wife's leg.
It's a deal. Hey, Moe. Wanna come with me and Wally to the Super Bowl?	Sorry.
Yeah, they're good. But I wouldn't count out the... Denver Broncos .	Oh, absolutely. My favorite team's in it: the Atlanta Falcons . Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I've always loved the Atlanta Falcons .
C'mon, Lenny. I just need four more guys to fill my Super Bowl bus. Whaddaya say?	I hear that President Clinton is going to be watching with his wife Hillary .
C'mon!...	Nah.
C'mon!	Nah.
Oh, c'mon!...	Nah.
Yes! Now that Lenny's in, Carl will fall like a domino.	Ahh.
Yeah, yeah. Do we have any pencils that work?	I'm so happy you're going to the big game. My dream has always been to see the Bolshoi Ballet.
Yeah, it's a good group.	Wow, you've signed up quite a few people, Dad: Sea Captain, Bumblebee Man, Comic Book Guy, the Squeaky Voiced Teen...
Aw, thank God! Now we can stop holding it in.	Yeah. Not a dame in sight.
What is it, Rudy?	Aw, crap. It's that pip-squeak Rudy.
Hey, Troy Aikman!	Whooo!
'Scuse me, comin' through. Friends of Dan Marino.	Man, that hurts.
Okay, Dan. Fire away.	'Scuse me, comin' through. Friends of Dan Marino.
Woo hoo! Homer Simpson with the pick!	I'm catching a pass from Dan Marino! This is the greatest moment of my...
Uh-oh. Lateral, to Bart!	Hey, Bubba. Hacksaw. Get that moron.
My spine.	Uh-oh. Lateral, to Bart!
Scalping tickets to the Super Bowl. Have you no shame, sir? I should give you a royal caning.	Who needs tickets? Tickets right here. How 'bout you, Slick?
Aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. Wally and I have all the tickets we need.	Hey, I'm just tryin' to make an honest buck.
Stop eating our tickets!	"Yeah. See, the hologram's missing. And there's no such team as the ""Spongos."" And finally, these seem to be printed on some sort of cracker."
"Yes, if by ""crestfallen"" you mean ""kill us."" Listen, let me talk to them. Maybe I can smooth this over."	Oh, how could I fall for fake tickets? Gee, the fellas are gonna be crestfallen.
My friends...	"Yes, if by ""crestfallen"" you mean ""kill us."" Listen, let me talk to them. Maybe I can smooth this over."
Please, my friends... Ow! All right, I'll get you into to the game!	Kill 'em!
Excuse me, Uh, Mr. Scalper, sir. Have I told you that I love you?	Please, my friends... Ow! All right, I'll get you into to the game!
Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat. Reverend Lovejoy was working the body...	Forget it. You'll just hurt me like all the others.
Gentlemen, I have an idea.	Wait, Dad, look!
Run!	Gentlemen, I have an idea.
Woo hoo!	Run!
We can still make the kickoff!	Get back here!
Let us outta here!	I tell you, Pat, that wild first quarter blew out my Telestrator, and now the fans are screaming for more.
Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?	You got my vote.
I didn't ask for your life story. Just give me the key.	Me? I'm Dolly Parton.
Man, that's gonna be some show.	Oo, look at the time. I better scoot to that halftime show. See y'all.
Football!	Who's ready for some football?!
You guys are following me? I was following Flanders.	Yeah. Where?
Hey, it's the beer copter!	In a minute.
Hit the road, Gramps. This is a private sky box.	What the bloody hell?
The game! We're so close!	Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Follow me, boys. We're finally going to the Sup... Ow!	The game! We're so close!
Y'ello...	Let... Go... Booze!
Hey, howyadoin'?	Uh, hello, this is President Clinton.
Well, it's about time.	You know, your determination and grit under extreme pressure are an inspiration. The whole country is proud of you.
Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it.	And on behalf of America, I'd like to...
But this might be my last chance to win one.	Dad, that doesn't belong to you.
Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.	Well, we sure put together a heck of a trip, Homer. Ever thought about being a travel agent?
What one?	"'Cause you can really ""go places"" in the travel business. Huh? Feel free to use that one."
Door?	The start of television's second most exciting season -- mid-season... is just 200 exciting seconds away.
Phone?	Locked.
Dog, cat?	Unplugged.
Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place.	Aw geez, there they got me living with an African-American, a Semite-American and a Woman-American, there. And I'm glad. I love youse all. I love everybody. I wish I'd saved my money from the first show.
You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.	Isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
"There's ""The Laughter Family."" That's animated. Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."	You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.
"Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kinda stupid. Hey, ""PoliceCops."" That sounds like a lethal combination."	It's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of Admiral.
Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.	This isn't bad.
This is better.	The Renaissance.
He's named like my name!	Simpson. Detective Homer Simpson.
Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly. Did you see the way Daddy caught that bullet?	Arrest that guy. And that's the end of that chapter...
Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa.	That's not really you, Dad. He's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name.
Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simpson. Who's this?... The Debbie Pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... Yes, I'm still available.	Another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
Marge, that was Debbie Pinson. DEB-BIE PIN-SON.	No he's not.
Local Man Has Same Name. A TV character has the same name as Springfield resident Homer Simpson.	Hey Homer! Homer! Check it out. Bottom of page twelve.
And that's the end of that chapter.	Hey, you're famous.
All right. And what's the name?	Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir, can I get your autograph?
Take it or leave it... Carl.	You only wrote my name. Um, I wanted yours.
Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference.	So, uh, what kind of adventure you gonna be involved in tonight, Homer?
Yup. Right down to the scarf.	So they really based that Homer Simpson character on you, huh?
Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid.	Simp-sonnnn!!
No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that's gotta be it.	Hey, looks like they changed the character into a bumbling sidekick.
Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!	Yeah, come on, dum-dum, do something unintelligent, there.
Gentlemen, I bid you--	Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!	Gentlemen, I bid you--
I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid?	Ooh. I don't think he'll be, doin' no encores for a while.
That does it! There's only one thing I can do.	I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid?
I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.	"Your character provides the comic relief. Like... Ohhh... Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now."""
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about...	He's about to do something stupid.
People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get outta here. Forget the baby's medicine.	Haw haw.
Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home.	But her forehead's on fire.
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's.	Your catch phrase is hysterical. Please say it clearly for my answering machine tape.
Okay.	Oh, it's never enough, not for them. Once they get a taste of you, they want more and more and more. That reminds me, do you mind if my nephew kicks you in the belly?
The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!	Aw, the flash didn't go off. Ya got another one in you, Josh?
And that big yellow flower.	Okay.
Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there.	Homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. Why don't you talk to the producers of the show? Maybe they'll make your character suave again.
"Yeah. ""Bart."""	Bart?
Uh, so, I just want to know how come you made your Homer Simpson character so...	"Yeah. ""Bart."""
It better have.	Stupid? Well, I can assure you, it happened organically.
Who's Jeremy Piven?	But then we found out that ABC had a similar project in development with Annie Potts and Jeremy Piven.
PoliceCops.	But it scared the hell out of us. So we slapped together a cop show instead.
Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid?	PoliceCops.
I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back.	Oh, he's not stupid. He's a street-smart, fish-out-of-water in a world he never made.
"Your honor, I'd like to sue the producers of ""PoliceCops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name."	Now he's stupid and whiny.
Then I'd like to legally change my name.	"Court finds in favor of ""PoliceCops."" Next case."
Any of these will be fine.	What name would you prefer?
Dynamic, isn't it?	Max Power??
That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, uncompromising, and rude.	You changed your name without consulting me?
Yes, briefly.	But this will be so confusing. The mailman won't know what to do. Did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.	And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap yourself in and feel the G's.	"But I fell in love with Homer Simpson. I don't want to snuggle with ""Max Power."""
And it doesn't stop in the bedroom. Oh no, I'm taking charge. Kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way.	Oh, Lord.
Yeah, but faster.	Isn't that the wrong way?
MAX POWER / HE'S THE MAN / WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOUCH / BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH / HIS NAME SOUNDS GOOD IN YOUR EAR / BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, YOU MUSTN'T FEAR / 'CAUSE HIS NAME CAN BE SAID BY ANYONE...	We should really put that in the corner.
You remembered my name!	Ah! Max Power! How's every little thing?
Mr. Power.	Well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like you? Keep up the good work, Max.
So I want the monogram to read M-A-X P-O-W-	Yes, of course. Mr. Power.
Max Power doesn't abbreviate. Each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. Maybe more important. No, as important.	Sir, traditionally, a monogram is just initials.
And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag.	Very well...
Just takin' care of business.	The man knows what he likes.
Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power.	If you don't, who will, huh? Trent Steel.
Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer.	Oh, heyyy, great name.
Yeah, but I usually have three or four.	I like a man who can poke fun at himself. Ooh, hey, my one o'clock canceled. Have you had any lunch?
Tie good. You like shirt?	LEADING HIM OFF) So, where to eat? You like Thai?
Marge, this is Thai food. From now on, I want it morning, noon and night.	Tie good. You like shirt?
When Trent Steel bought me some.	When did you start liking Thai food?
He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.	Who's Trent Steel?
Oh, I spit my gum in there.	What's this wrapped in a banana leaf? Mmm, smells like mint.
No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... Anyway, you wouldn't understand.	Where'd you meet this Trent Steel? Moe's?
For all of us. Look.	Well, I guess your new name is really opening doors for you.
This is our chance to rub elbows with Springfield's young, hip power couples... Like me and Debbie Pinson.	You are invited to a garden party this Saturday!
Get used to it, honey. From now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters.	Wow, look at this place. The house number is spelled out with letters!
Nah. Just park it.	Did you wish me to destroy this machine for you?
And I counted the pennies in the ashtray.	Heh. Very well.
Maarrge... President Clinton!	Very nice, Ed. Your inventions continue to impress me and the entire nation.
Me, too. Let's sing the Cinderella song.	Oh, my Lord! I feel like Cinderella.
Uh-oh. Here comes Lorne Michaels. Pretend you don't see him.	Eh, maybe later.
Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?	Ah, Max Power. Trent said I absolutely must meet you. This is fab...
"So I said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come I can't eat the walls?"""	Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?
Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch...	I thought I knew all the players in Springfield. Where have you been hiding yourself?
Hey, no problem.	Attention, please. Attention. Um, I just wanna say how thrilled I am with this turnout. I'm proud to share my home with Springfield's best and brightest.
Woo, privilege!	We've all been blessed with privilege and success.
Whuh?!	Uh, but with privilege comes grave responsibility...
Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!	We all have to give something back to the world that's been so good to us.
Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.	We have to protect them, because trees can't protect themselves. Except, of course, the Mexican Fighting Trees.
Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!	To the protest bus!
What's going on, Trent? Where are you taking me?	Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!
Oh, this is the worst party ever.	It's a go-cart powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
"Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's ""A"" list, but these people are nuts."	I don't know. Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.	You can't blame them for having a social conscience.
That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy gets it.	Hang in there, Max. Saving the environment is a hard, grueling job.
Tree-huggers...	Man, I have really had it with you tree-huggers.
No, I just thought it was cute when you called him...	Something funny, Nature Boy?
I can't lose them!	Keep runnin', Max!
Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!	Uh, you better call for backup, Chief!
I'm free! Woo hoo!	Slow down, punk!
So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?	This is terrible.
What?	So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?
Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey.	Well, I'm glad you changed your name back to Homer Simpson.
Oh, I almost forgot. While I was at the courthouse, I had them change your name.	G'night.
Chesty LaRue.	To what?
Just try it for two weeks. If you're not completely satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire.	Chesty LaRue?!
Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.	I don't want to be Chesty LaRue or Busty St. Claire!
Sleep tight, Hooty.	Goodnight, Homer.
And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. But the evil ogre, Barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. So the prince went out back to the enchanted alley...	Let go of those.
Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon...	That's not a fairy tale. It's just something that happened to you at Moe's.
I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!	I didn't turn it on yet.
"Hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" Eh."	Stop worrying, Apu. The Kwik-E-Mart is in good hands.
Door's unlocked.	Maybe we should not answer it, huh?
Oh, don't make me choose.	Who is your favorite Indian pop singer?
Yeah, I'm going right to the top.	Oh, yeah, Homer's a real go-getter.
Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word.	Maybe we should leave.
"I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."	You don't know what they're saying.
Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'.	Oh, I hope we didn't get Apu in too much trouble.
Hey, they stole our idea! See, look!	Either put that book down or let me drive.
"""I Cherish You, My Precious."" Mm, nah. ""To a heckuva blacksmith."" Nah, I already got him one."	Ooo.
"""You're A-peeling. Let's Never Split."" That's funny 'cause they're monkeys. So long, rejects."	"""I Cherish You, My Precious."" Mm, nah. ""To a heckuva blacksmith."" Nah, I already got him one."
Mornin', Apu. Still in hot water with the squaw?	"""You're A-peeling. Let's Never Split."" That's funny 'cause they're monkeys. So long, rejects."
Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash.	Worse than ever I am afraid. My shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. Now, I fear she will leave me.
Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.	Ooh, ooh, you are right, there's still seven days before Valentine's. Ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet Manjula.
C'mon, boy. C'mon!	Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.
"Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog."	Dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the Sunday paper.
Now to trim away the fat.	"Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog."
"""Outlook."" ""Vista."" No. ""Spotlight."" ""Mosaic."" Nah."	Now to trim away the fat.
Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this.	I'd love to look at SculleryWeek -- if you're through with it.
Gimme that!	This is about investment opportunities in Yemen.
Well, don't just gasp, read it.	Hey, look at this one. It's a poem. From Apu!
I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.	Oh, how romantic!
We sold it, didn't we?	The only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
Yeah, I hate that song.	"Then the bird sang ""I Love The Night Life""... with clever new lyrics."
Don't worry, honey. I got something really special planned for Valentine's Day.	I do too. But it was sweet. Women really like that sort of thing, Homie.
Wouldn't you like to know?	It's not that monkey card I found in the car, is it?
Everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. See the problem's communication. Too much communication.	Reverend Timothy Lovejoy says he's counseled a number of disenchanted wives, including Maude Flanders.
But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy!	Homer, I've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos.
This Valentine's crap has gone too far.	You just don't get it.
And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?	Oh, Moe.
Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad!	I got some of that myself. / Oh, screw myself.
We've gotta stop that traitor Apu.	Hey, watch it! You're all over the road!
I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk.	Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?
Let's roll.	Hey, there he goes!
Not yet, I'm not. You'll know when I'm driving. And it'll...	Uh, Homer, you're drivin'.
Only till eleven.	A croissant? What the...? Oh, that's right. They have breakfast at Tiffany's now.
Not entirely.	Well, this is turning out to be a total waste of time.
Oh, baby. We got him now. There's no escape from the airport.	Man, that smarts!
Hey, look! It's Elton John!	I told you we shouldn't have gone for long-term parking.
Not if I can help it. And help it I might.	I got it. I got it. Apu musta hired him to sing for Manjula.
Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.	Not if I can help it. And help it I might.
Uhhhh.	Oh, that's very sweet. Have a Grammy.
Sir Elton, my noble friends and I would like to dub you a Knight of the... Grand Concourse.	Uhhhh.
How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage.	Really? I did that?
Not so fast, Apu!	Don't be frightened. That tank's just Peace Corps surplus.
We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?	Homer! What a delightful coincidence.
Oh no you don't!	We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?
Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting!	Oh no you don't!
I am so sick of that damn code!	I have to deliver a message! It's the skywriter's code.
Lousy message.	Just once I'd like a love note in the sky.
Correction. Kill us both.	Stop, you crazy fool, you'll kill us all!
Ow! Prickers! Owwww!	Oh, galldurnit! Why won't you die?!
Roses. So many roses.	What in the world?
Roses.	Just when I think I have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses.
Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!	Oh, I'm gonna snuggle your brains out.
Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!	Oh! Don't go too far. If you like cafeteria workers in Beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half.
You drive. I eat.	Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!
I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid.	Dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks.
C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!	Mom, to your left. He's letting you in. Go!
Ohhh, you suck, Marge.	C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!
Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took.	So long, schlubs!
Canyonero...	Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took.
Hey, a red one! Can I buy that? Please?	Go ahead, drool all you want. Ya can't hurt that finish. Now, rain water, that'll strip it right off. Sa-- Aw, and I shouldn't have said that. C'mon, Gil.
Will do!	Okay, you've got the undercoating, clear coating, rust proofing, underguard spray, gravelguard XJ, Vita-seal, Repelzit... but if you wanna protect the paint, you better keep it in this tent.
And that's it, right?	Okay, here's how your lease breaks down. This is your down payment... then here's your monthly... and there's your weekly...
But that's not for awhile, right?	Yup. Oh, then, after your final monthly payment, there's the routine C.B.P., or crippling balloon payment.
Sweet...	Right.
Huh?	Yeah, you don't see many men driving the F series.
Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this.	See? Instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder.
Shut up! Screw you guys!	A pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants.
Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.	Shut up! Screw you guys!
Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it.	You cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid Canyonero. Why can't you drive it?
Fine.	I don't think you're gay. I just have to do my grocery shopping. Now please gimme my keys.
Sucker.	Fine.
Marge, you've been out there all morning.	A three-chambered peanut! Marge, look what I did! Come quick! Hurry! Marge?
So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.	So?
Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what.	Nobody will ever cut me off again!
Well, that's a turn-off.	How could they take away my license? It feels like I lost a limb.
At least I've got a license.	No, your father drives like an old lady.
I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.	Bart, they're not here to entertain us.
I don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.	I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal.	But Dad, lemurs are nocturnal.
I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm just gonna wake him up.	No!
Oh no. I'm out of popcorn.	Back! Back, I say!
You throw your peanuts!	Throw your peanuts!
Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?	C'mon, Homer! Jump!
Who's out there?!	Oh, thank you, God. And thank you Porta-John. You really saved my...
Nice rhino.	Oh, I'm gonna die! Jesus, Allah, Buddha, I love you all!
Oh, no! She's not gonna make it!	Nice rhino.
Ah, give me a minute...	It's okay, Homie. You can come out now.
Oh, Marge, you saved me!	Ah, give me a minute...
Is there anything that guy doesn't know?	Stone Philips again!
Oh, I'm sure of it!	Do you think there's anything great on NBC right now?
I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad, FOX good. CBS great.	But there's only one way to find out!
19-- 1939?! Oh my God, I've gone back in time!	Okay, FDR is in the White House, an ice cream cone costs a nickel, and a hot new tune by Benny Goodman is hitting the charts. The year is 1939.
I've got to warn everybody about Hitler! And get to the ice cream store!	19-- 1939?! Oh my God, I've gone back in time!
Shut up! You haven't even been born yet.	Let me guess. You travel back in time again?
Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys.	Easy, Homer. I'll bring you back.
Woo hoo! Let's party!	Yeah, too bad we gotta work, huh, Homer? Homer?
That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.	C'mon, move your butt! You're blocking traffic!
Okay.	Come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair.
Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?	Okay.
Well, Marge?	Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?
What's your favorite radio station?	What?
Hey, that's super! See you later.	Okay, Dad, we're ready.
Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.	Oh, quit complaining. It's half the work of the divorced dad.
They know I'm kidding.	Homer...
Okay, Bart, it's your turn to pick. Where are we headed? Bowling? Demolition derby? P.J. O'Harrigans? Isn't that a funny name? Huh? Huh?	They know I'm kidding.
We did a Lisa thing last month. And I'm glad we did, but now I think we should do something normal people would like.	Hysterical, but I traded my turn to Lisa for her dessert.
Go ahead, sweetie.	She didn't say it yet!
Oh, no! Ho, ho. I'm not falling for that again. If it doesn't have Siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair.	The book fair?
We're gonna go see Marmaduke?	Oh, this is perfect!
What? And Marmaduke doesn't?	It encapsulates America and makes history come alive!
This is all your fault for trading away your turn. Just for that, no dessert tonight!	Sorry, Dad. My mind is made up.
Good ol' government.	I can answer that. Uncle Sam needs to spend our tax dollars on the essentials: anti-tobacco programs, pro-tobacco programs, killing wild donkeys, and Israel.
Thank God for grave robbers.	Look, they have Lincoln's hat!
Fonzie's jacket!	America's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
Who's Fonzie?! Don't they teach you anything in school? He freed the squares.	Who's Fonzie?
Where? I don't see that.	It guarantees all of the basic freedoms -- speech, religion, the right to a speedy trial...
Relax. I'm just boning up on the ol' Constitution.	Get out of Archie Bunker's chair! Now!
I didn't mean to! Look!	Look, he got chocolate on it!
Wha?!	Really, that much? It's gonna cost ten thousand dollars to repair that document.
Finally, a company that understands my needs.	Of course OmniTouch understands that real money doesn't grow on trees. Not these days.
So we're even then?	We sure do. It's called caring.
It's called caring, Marge.	"We prefer to think of them as ""keep-in-touch towers."""
Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming.	Plus you've increased Springfield's roaming capabilities 64 percent.
Hey, this is pretty comfortable. That Andy Capp was onto something.	I guess...
Just pretend it's a tree, honey. Or as we say at OmniTouch, a Progress Tree.	Ugh, that antenna is an eyesore.
Wha?! I heard a yell. Did you touch a wire?	My room!
Nothing. They just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and I know how much you like that sciencey stuff so I...	What happened to my room?!
Come on, Lisa, try and see this from the OmniTouch Corporation's point of view.	You gave away my room!
Hm. That thought never occurred to me. Funny how your mind works in a crisis.	I can't believe you did this, Dad. Why didn't you put that thing in your room?
Lisa, what's your favorite movie?	But where am I supposed to live?!
"That's right, ""The Odd Couple."" So meet your comically mismatched roommate, Bart Simpson."	"Until you taped over it, ""The Little Mermaid."""
Ooh, anything spicy?	Homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!
Great. I'm gonna eat mayonnaise!	Oh, that's not the point. We should report this to an OmniTouch Care-Rep. People's privacy is at stake.
Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel, the Three...	Ohhh! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it!
Bart, stop squeaking your chair!	Dad, will you please tell Bart to stop squeaking his chair. I'm trying to do my homework.
If you've got to do something, click this pen.	Bart, stop squeaking your chair!
Hey, that looks like fun.	No-ho-ho...
You're on! Lisa, you play winner.	Race ya!
"Oh, honey, you missed a great race. Bart was winning, but then he said ""this is stupid"" and he stopped, and I won!"	You're on! Lisa, you play winner.
Hey, you're mad at me. That wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?	I am trying to do my homework.
Maybe you'd feel better if we watched some TV together.	Dad, why did you have to take away my room?
No it's not.	I just want to study.
"Oooh, here's something you'd like. ""When Animals Attack Magicians."""	Da-ad!
Awful entertaining.	That's awful!
Somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.	My tummy really hurts.
Yes it is.	Is that somebody you, Homer?
Great. Maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.	Okay, then you can take Lisa to Dr. Hibbert's.
Well, that's a relief.	Lisa I'm afraid your tummy ache may be caused by stress.
Give it a try, honey.	Yes... Anyway, when it comes to stress, I believe laughter is the best medicine. You know before I learned to chuckle mindlessly, I was headed for an early grave myself.
It's true. I'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em.	I'm really not the chuckling type.
Oh, no you don't. Screw that touchy, queery crap! We'll take the harsh antacids. Nothing's too good for my little girl.	Yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --
I sure settled his hash. Imagine that quack thinking you'd try one of those crazy New-Age cures.	Oh, no you don't. Screw that touchy, queery crap! We'll take the harsh antacids. Nothing's too good for my little girl.
Sure they are, honey.	They're not all crazy, Dad.
I'm sorry, Lisa. Oh, it's not your fault. I know we love each other, Dad, but we're two very different people. And, much as I hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart.	You know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. And just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!
Oh Lisa, honey, I won't ever let that happen.	I'm sorry, Lisa. Oh, it's not your fault. I know we love each other, Dad, but we're two very different people. And, much as I hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart.
Nah, you must be thinking of your mother. I'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... Can't we just go in?	Dad, you don't have to go to a New Age store just for me. I know you think this stuff is stupid.
"Oh good, I've been meaning to buy a ""Dream Catcher?"" Gimme a break."	Nah, you must be thinking of your mother. I'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... Can't we just go in?
"Other cultures are fine. I'm just saying I can get along in life without a ""tooth brush."""	I just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
And a ooga-booga to you too.	Namaste.
Absolutely not. My little girl's tummy hurts. Do you have anything to stop her complaining?	May I tell you about our White Light Specials?
Let's try some oil of Lorenzo. And, uh, what's keeping Joan Rivers alive?	Well, your tongue works.
Oh no. No freezing.	Fetal grindings. But I have a better idea.
Can you pee in it?	No, Mr. Simpson, this is a sensory deprivation tank. It blocks out all the external distractions that bombard our souls.
Me too.	I'll take two hours.
Oh, my.	You're about to take a journey into the mind. You may see and experience things that are strange and frightening. But remember, they can't physically harm you, though they may destroy you mentally.
OOH EEE OOH AH AH / TING TANG WALLA WALLA BING BANG / OOH EEE OOH AH AH / WALLA BING BANG TING TING TOOO!	Hey...
Heyyy, this piece of junk is finally doing something.	There's only enough room on the truck for this one. We'll get the other one later.
Oh yeah... art.	You should lift with your legs.
Woo! Sensory deprivation kicks ass.	Shut up!
Okay, I'm ready to get out now... Yoo hoo! Hippie lady! Hippie lady?! Hey! Hippie lady!	This is the best birthday I ever had!
Whoa! What's going on? Ow! Oh! This inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.	Okay, I'm ready to get out now... Yoo hoo! Hippie lady! Hippie lady?! Hey! Hippie lady!
Hippie Lady I wanna get out.	Whoa! What's going on? Ow! Oh! This inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.
I told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. Bom-bom-bom-bom... I told the witch doctor he had to run a test...	Gee, I should cut Dad some slack. After all, he did take me to the ballet, and the Smithsonian exhibit... In fact, he takes me lots of places he hates.
Hi sweetie.	I told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. Bom-bom-bom-bom... I told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
I went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. How was yours?	Hi, Dad. How was it?
Like what?	Pretty cool. But now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?
Whoa, look at that car burn! Does it get any better than this?	Like what?
"So I said to that nurse, ""You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."""	Mmm.
You better believe I did.	Well, you told her, Dad.
Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see...	You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you.
Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met...	Not you.
Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?	I think I read somewhere that cows like being killed.
C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse!	Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?
Didn't I?	You didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
Wow. It's even more wonderful than Lisa said!	Didn't I?
Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs.	"Well, there is one steak that's only available by special request, uh... We call it, uh, ""Sir Loin-A-Lot."" It's, uh, the size of a Boogie-board."
They like me because I'm brave.	Ladies and gentlemen... This brave man has accepted the Sir Loin-A-Lot challenge. He will pit his stomach against sixteen pounds of indomitable tenderloin.
Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--	Uh, if you want some friendly advice, pal, I wouldn't tackle the big'un right away.
It's you! You're him! You're Tony Randall!	Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--
Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?	Red Barclay's my name. I'm a trucker, and I've eaten steaks from coast to coast, with taters and toast. Take my advice, this one's not for greenhorns.
Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly...	It's an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody.
Huh? Oh, right. The steak.	No, Homer! Don't fill up on bread!
So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...	Come on, Dad, pick up the pace. Chew and swallow, no savoring.
Lousy drunks. I'll show them.	Oh, humans are so ridiculous. He's not even halfway through Walter and he's already hallucinating.
What's happening to me? There's still food... but I don't want to eat it. I've become everything I've ever hated.	Lousy drunks. I'll show them.
My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?	The winner and still champion, Reliable Red Barclay!
"He called me ""Greenhorn."" I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had."	There goes the finest trucker who ever lived.
Oh yes he will! And on time, too!	In 38 years, he never missed a shipment. But I guess this is one delivery ol' Red won't be making.
I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer.	Oh no. Oh, no...
Don't you have school?	Oh, lemme go with you, Dad!
Ah, touché.	Don't you have work?
Bye, Marge!	Ah, touché.
Aren't you gonna say bye?	Bye, Marge!
That didn't sound like you meant it.	Good-bye, Homer.
That's more like it. So long, suckers!	Oh, all right. Good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip.
Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.	Why? You already know I'm here, don't ya?
Oh, yeah? My left arm says different.	Well, you're not really a trucker now.
Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.	Well, according to Red's schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days.
Ohhh.	"""If you wanna be my lover / You gotta get with my friends / Makin' love forever / Friendship's where that ends / If you wanna be my lover...,if you wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends makin love forever friendships where that ends if you wanna be my lover,25

That little punk.	Ohhh.
Sure thing, Gwenn.	A little more high-test, darlin'?
Aww... that's a nice, friendly gal.	I'll be right back with your pie, hon.
Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.	Yeah.
Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife.	I suppose.
For now...	Will that be all, sweetie?
It ate everybody.	What about... Erika?
Stupid!	It ate everybody.
I bet ol' Red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.	Stupid!
Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule.	Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too.
Ten hours?! We gotta roll!	Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours.
Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long.	Ten hours?! We gotta roll!
Sold!	Well, Congress is racing back to Washington to outlaw these...
No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.	Hey! You can't take that many pep pills at once!
Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal!	No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight...	Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal!
I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle!	I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight...
You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.	I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle!
The what now?	Yeah, that Navitron Auto-Drive System's made our jobs cushier than ever.
The trucks drive themselves?	With this baby drivin' your truck for ya, all you gotta do is sit back and feel your ass grow.
Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often.	Sh-hey-hey-hey-sh! Didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got goin'?
Wow! You guys are even lazier than me! Well, don't worry. I'll keep your secret.	We get 40 bucks an hour to drive these rigs. You think anybody'd hire us if they knew we weren't really drivin' the trucks?
Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady.	See that you do.
And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!	The second I let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in.
C'mon out, boy. It's windy.	And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!
Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay?	Well, well. / What's that? / Will wonders never cease?
Look, son. It's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy.	Oh, your father traded our tools for M&M's again. Ah, the heck with it.
Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity.	He hit us!
Thank you sir, may I have another?	Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity.
Oh, why do all my trips end like this?	Dad, they're trying to kill us!
Eat water, good buddy.	Oh, why do all my trips end like this?
I think we lost 'em, Bart.	Oh! My good knife! My wife's gonna kill me.
Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy.	Dad, stop!
All right.	Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy.
I'm keeping a promise to an American roadmaster.	What are you doing?
Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?	Huh?
We'll get past that barrier somehow. Ol' Blinky here will find a way.	/ Simpson, you'd better turn that thing...!
I'm not Red, I'm Homer.	I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red. The risk is unacceptable.
Woo hoo!	Something better!
Ten-four, dead buddy.	Yep. You're gonna make it, Dad. And somewhere up there, I bet Red is saying thanks.
This is Red Barclay's shipment. On time, as always.	Ten-four, dead buddy.
Well... the last time I saw him, he was in a big plastic bag.	All right, let's see... Artichokes... aannnd migrant workers. Lookin' good. So, where is ol' Red anyway?
Well, son. I guess it's time to go home.	Yeah, that sounds like Red, all right.
No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide.	Any thoughts on how we're gonna get there?
Thank you.	Are you crazy? I'm not driving a trainload of napalm to Springfield!
Oh, man. This is the hottest Easter ever.	And as we pass the collection plate, please give as though the person next to you were watching.
Relax, I found it in the dumpster.	Who put this wicked idol in the collection plate?
Heads up!	Oooo. What a beautiful garden. It's almost like paradise.
'Course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden. Hey, you must be Eve.	Hey, Chief, he splashed me.
Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib.	Uh, I guess.
Is there!	Speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?
Don't mind if I do!	Good morning, Adam. Any bacon for you, then?
No, you're too kind. And wise, and righteous... I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.	Oh Adam, you're too kind.
No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives.	I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit.
"Sorry, I already gave him a name. ""Land monster."""	"Oh, how cute. Let's call this little guy a ""groundhog..."""
Branch monster.	Really? Well, what do you call that thing on the branch?
Why won't you be art?!	Quite so, mum. I recall one of the dinosaurs had a bite and well, that was the last of -- Egad!
You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.	Please stop eating that. God's gonna furious.
And you keep saying we need to do things together...	Well, it is a sin to waste food...
Uh, um, uh... I think we should see other people?	Adam, say something.
I didn't say stop.	Usually a mink massage makes me feel better. But something's missing now.
Yeah, just like yesterday.	Lovely day in paradise, isn't it?
I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever.	Today I'm featuring mouth-watering pork ribs. Tuck in, then!
Oh, poor Eve. What are you doing out there in that horrible place?	One whole rib, and still standing. Well, aren't you the plucky one, sir.
"This is my fault. I shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""Applegate"" thing."	I'm toiling! What does it look like?
Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?	Well, it's a little late for apologies now.
C'mon, Eve. Hurry!	I'll be fine. Just give me a second to... ugh...
Ohhh, my dear, sweet Eve. I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush.	C'mon, Eve. Hurry!
Oh, there, there, I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord.	And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?
Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right?	Oh, shut up. You are so banished.
Oh, yeah. Definitely pain!	Ohhh, my back. So this must be that pain thing.
This sucks. Things were so much better back in the Garden.	Oh, yeah. Definitely pain!
The pie shall be cut in two. Then each man shall receive... death. I'll eat the pie.	King Solomon, these men need you to settle a dispute. They each claim ownership of this pie.
Eh, it's not the end of the world.	Oh, how embarrassing. Oh, we slept right through church.
I never used those pizza coupons.	It's the Rapture. And I never knew true love.
Where do you think you're going, Missy?	Oh, right. The sins.
Ooh, I smell barbecue!	Dad!
Hey, look! Oh, they're out of hot dogs! And the cole slaw has pineapple in it! German potato salad!	Ooh, I smell barbecue!
You put da beer in da coconut and drink it all up / You put da beer in da coconut and throw da can away...	Hey, look! Oh, they're out of hot dogs! And the cole slaw has pineapple in it! German potato salad!
You throw da can away...	Homer!
You throw da can away...	I said Homer!
Marge, I'm out of beer.	You throw da can away...
But, Marge, I'm not like other men. That's why you buy my pants at that special store.	You know, Homie, a lot of men use their Saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint.
Fine. I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you. But you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my Saturday. Can you live with that, Marge? Huh? Can ya?	And you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
Can you?	Yup.
'Scuse me, I have a few questions for Pop.	God... bless him!
Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox.	"Hey, get off my case. The only reason I'm working here is 'cause I'm trying to get a date with ""Mom."""
I'd like to return this barbecue kit.	You mean the janitor's closet? Ha!
A man in an apron!	"Hi, I'm Doug Vaccaro. You know me as Chip, the wisecracking assistant on the hit sitcom, ""Toolin' Around."""
No, no, I'm into chicken.	Or if you're not into chicken...
Mmmm... hippo...	How 'bout wild boar? Or swordfish? Or hippo?
How 'bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?	Light-hearted apron not included. Snapping fingers may not make food appear.
We can all burn evidence in it.	Can I burn evidence in it?
There, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?	We can all burn evidence in it.
Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over.	Dad, I really need to rest my back.
Oh, yeah. That's a fine looking...	Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over.
Okay, no big deal...	Oh, yeah. That's a fine looking...
Stupid Lisa.	Okay, no big deal...
You gotta build fast! Cement drying!	Stupid Lisa.
All right, let's see...	You gotta build fast! Cement drying!
"English side ruined! Must use French instructions! ""Le grille?"" What the hell is that?!"	All right, let's see...
Come on... fit you...	"English side ruined! Must use French instructions! ""Le grille?"" What the hell is that?!"
Yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... Why doesn't mine look like that?!	Come on... fit you...
Why?! Why must life be so hard? Why must I fail in every attempt at masonry?	Yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... Why doesn't mine look like that?!
Well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here.	All returned items must be in a box and accompanied by a receipt.
Come on, you...	Sorry. I didn't get this hammer hat by handing out refunds.
Well, of course. Any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. It teaches them while they learn.	Yeah, hold on there, Santa Claus. That box is for toys only.
But, but...	Yeah, nice try, Saint Nick. Now hit the road, Kris Kringle.
I'll never get rid of it. It'll follow me to the ends of the Earth!	Beanie Baby.
All right! My bumper fell off!	I'll never get rid of it. It'll follow me to the ends of the Earth!
Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!	All right! My bumper fell off!
Uh-oh.	Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!
Take the kids out back.	Homie, someone's at the door. They want to talk to you about some sort of car accident.
I'll handle this.	Take the kids out back.
Oh yeah? Prove it.	Mr. Simpson? I believe something of yours struck my car yesterday.
Uh... All right! Just go ahead and sue me. Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000.	That's your license plate, isn't it?
You mean this hunka junk? This isn't art. Just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you?! You stupid so...	I'm not here to sue you. My name is Astrid Weller. I own an art gallery and I'd love to display your piece.
Oh, I got that, lady.	Art isn't just pretty pictures. It's an expression of raw human emotion. In your case, rage.
This lady says I'm an artist.	Is everything okay? I got worried when I didn't hear any shots.
"In high school I was voted ""Most Likely to be a Mental Patient, Hillbilly, or Chimpanzee!"""	"Your husband's work is what we call ""Outsider Art."" It could be by a mental patient or a hillbilly or a chimpanzee."
So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...	Well, you should be very excited, because outsider art couldn't be hotter.
Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns.	Dad, chew with your mouth closed. You're losing your mystique.
Woo hoo! Look, Marge, my first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns!	Congratulations, Homer -- you're now a professional artist!
I'm gonna be an outsider artist! That way, I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable.	Where are you going with that junk, Dad?
Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr.	Homie, I'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?
I think I remember my own life, Marge.	That's my life you're describing.
Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me, I'm Mister Mellow.	I think I remember my own life, Marge.
So I'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. C'mon, gimme what you got.	Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me, I'm Mister Mellow.
Good work, honey. Keep it comin'.	Well, if it'll help - Um, Mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy.
What do we owe you, Moe?	I must get back to my hotel and practice my affectations for tomorrow. Bon soir.
All right.	Nothin', nothin'. Just gimme a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity.
Is it about pies?	Wonderful news, Homer.
Wow. It's like Marge's dream come true... for me! Isn't that great, Marge?! For me!	Uh, no. We're going to hold a show devoted entirely to you.
Good night.	I'm happy for you. Now g'night.
You're upset about something. Is this about that trip Barney and I took to Machu Picchu?	Good night.
Aw, honey, I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like.	No, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life.
Frankly, I'd be a little turned on.	That's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if I, I don't know, entered a belching contest?
Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good.	You don't understand.
Now you're making sense. Good night.	Well, I guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy.
"I give you ""Botched Hibachi."" The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection."	Homer is the most dangerous artist on the Springfield scene. Now, let's see what surprises he has for us tonight.
"This piece I call ""Failed Shelving Unit with Stupid Stuck Chainsaw and Applesauce."""	"I give you ""Botched Hibachi."" The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection."
"And finally, my thing de resistance, ""Attempted Birdhouse I."""	"This piece I call ""Failed Shelving Unit with Stupid Stuck Chainsaw and Applesauce."""
Shall we start the bidding at, say, ten thousand dollars?	"And finally, my thing de resistance, ""Attempted Birdhouse I."""
All right, how about a million?	Shall we start the bidding at, say, ten thousand dollars?
What's going on here? You weirdos love this stuff.	I'll give you two bucks for the bird, if it's still alive.
Wait! Come back! I'm a God to you! Worship me -- or fear my wrath! Please fear my wrath, please... Call me.	Come on, Gunter, Kyoto. If we hurry we can still catch the heroin craze.
I don't get it. Why don't people like my art anymore?	Wait! Come back! I'm a God to you! Worship me -- or fear my wrath! Please fear my wrath, please... Call me.
Hey, Ray J. Johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been.	Homer, I know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same.
You can call him Ray / Or you can call him J. / Or you can call him Ray J. / But you doesn't have to call him...	Who?
Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw.	It's so exciting to do something cultural together.
Ow! Oh no, I'm being erased!	Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw.
He must be a hundred feet tall.	A Claes Oldenburg. He's a European who defied convention and embraced American popular culture.
It's glorious! The streets are paved with water. You could ride a walrus to work!	Now this is a Joseph Turner. In an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the Venetian Canals.
Mmmm, split-pea.	"And Picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. By the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. They call it his ""angry jerk"" period."
With ham!	Mmmm, split-pea.
No, these guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil.	Any ideas yet?
I'm just gonna rest for a minute.	No, these guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil.
What the?! Who the?! Hey!	I'm just gonna rest for a minute.
Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!	Soup's on, fat boy!
No, no, Andy, no!	Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!
Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.	Homer... Homer...
Oh, let's get out of here.	Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.
Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?	Well, Dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like Christo.
Not the Reichstag!	No, Christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. He once wrapped the Reichstag in plastic.
Why'd he do that?	Oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the California highway...
Killer umbrellas? Of course. Exquisite.	To make the world a more magical place, I guess. Although they did blow over and kill some people.
Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. Step one: steal all the doormats in town.	No, Dad, no. My point is you have to do something big and daring.
"Adios, ""Casa de Flanders."""	Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. Step one: steal all the doormats in town.
So long, The Simpsons!	"See you in hell, ""God Bless This House."""
Step two: snorkel the animals.	So long, The Simpsons!
Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.	It wasn't easy, but I got all the grizzlies.
Make sure you strap 'em on real tight.	Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.
Now, step three...	Make sure you strap 'em on real tight.
That's for the courts to decide, son.	Are you sure this is art, not vandalism?
Wake up! Wake up, Springfield!	That's for the courts to decide, son.
I've got a surprise for youuu!	Wake up! Wake up, Springfield!
People of Springfield, behold my latest work!	Oh, that can't be good.
It's conceptual art -- the Grand Canals of Springfield. Just like Venice without the black plague. What do you think?	Homer, what have you done?
No, I'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. You'll always be the artist in the family.	Well, Homer, I have to admit, you created something people really love. You truly are an artist.
Is that our house?	Ohh...
And is that us on the roof?	Yep.
Are we kissing?	That's us.
A mascot contest?! I'm sure to win that. Unless one of you jinxes me.	"To honor the arrival of our foreign friends and enemies, Channel Six is sponsoring a contest to find a Springfield Olympic Mascot. The winner will join such other memorable mascots as the Atlanta ""Whazzit""... and the Montreal ""Vampire."""
Shut up, shut up, shut up!	Yeah, go for the gold, Dad!
Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby.	Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Just for the prototype, honey.	You papier mache'd my cat?!
Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring!	Just for the prototype, honey.
It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.	Good work, Dad.
God bless America!	Ow!!
They picked Springy! In your face, Patty and Selma!	Oh! / Springs!
I've never wanted a beer worse in my life.	"""Coming! Hey, hey, hey! Children, children, future, future..."""
I love you, honey.	I've never wanted a beer worse in my life.
To you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover.	Are you talking to me or the beer?
He says what we're all thinking.	"Poland, eh? Ha. Too easy. How you doin', Germany? Here's my impression of an East German woman, ""Kiss me or I'll crush you."""
Lucky stiff. I'm working my ass off here. Good steak, honey.	That place sucks! The nurses don't let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him.
I'llgetit.	Sounds good to me!
Woo hoo! My springs! They finally came!	Delivery for Homer Simpson.
Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs.	But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville.
Idiots! Ooh, these are fun!	To who?
Hello, little girl, is your mommy home? You'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-Friend.	C'mon, Bart, we don't want to over-stimulate these people. They just had pudding.
Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item.	Ow! My eye! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts.	Homer, get outta here.
Welcome to the Kitchen of Tomorrow today! Marge, how much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan?	I want some taquitos.
Don't answer yet. Watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of God's greatest creation, the spring.	Nothing.
Now, watch this...	Don't answer yet. Watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of God's greatest creation, the spring.
Ow! Ohhh...	Now, watch this...
Some second degree burns, but some first class burgers.	Are you okay?
But you haven't seen the Baby of Tomorrow! Ta-daa!	I want you to get rid of these springs.
Now if I drop her, no more tears.	But you haven't seen the Baby of Tomorrow! Ta-daa!
"""D"" it up, Marge. I'm goin' to the hole."	Give me my baby!
You flush one down / It swirls around / Nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...	I want these springs out of our house today.
"Of course not! ""Nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / Nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."""	You're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?
A hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. A hundred and thirty-five springs...	What the heck's going on?
And I do! Woo!	"Except that on the handle somebody's carved ""HOMER ROCKS."""
Oh, we stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry.	I don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. When was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
Can't we go home yet? My feet hurt. All this fresh air is making my hair move. And I don't know how much longer I can complain.	Fine. If we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. I wrote another poem about a duck.
Could we, Marge? Could we get a horse?	Get a horse!
There are some dogs. We could all ride dogs.	We're walking, Homer.
Pew, well, I dodged a bullet.	Oh, look! There's the store where I buy my yarn. But you don't want to buy your buttons there.
Clown.	Where'd you get that champagne?
Thanks, Noodles.	Clown.
"Hey, it's not just a store. It's a ""mega"" store. ""Mega"" means ""good."" And ""store"" means ""thing."""	All this commotion just for a store?
Wow, what a high-tech wonderland. Oop, got an itch.	"Hey, it's not just a store. It's a ""mega"" store. ""Mega"" means ""good."" And ""store"" means ""thing."""
I DO!	I do! I do! / Right here!
I don't know. Just give me the dollar.	Ha! All right. What's your name, young man?
I do!	Well, I hope this starts you on your way to a great fortune. Now, who wants the second dollar?
I do.	Now...
Easy... easyyy...	Are you still here?
Woo hoo! Look at me, I can juggle!	Easy... easyyy...
I see. Well, I'll need some beer.	I need your help. I want to be loved.
Oh, Arthur Fortune!	I want you to look at me the way I saw you look at Arthur Fortune.
Well, you don't have to call me slovenly.	Yes! That's the look I'm looking for. What would make you and your slovenly kind look at me that way?
Well, how 'bout donating money to charity? Lots of crazy old coots do that.	Welcome to Mensa, Lisa.
Can do.	Take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the Springfield Hospital.
Wait a minute... because I brought the check, they named a wing after me? Oh, you must be mad.	Morphine, please.
Gee, I feel bad. If people knew the real Monty Burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you.	Well, I will be when the morphine wears off, but until then, Teedily deedily dee dee. Teedily dee dee dee. Woo hoo hoo. Hee hee hee.
Good luck, Mr. Burns. And if you get in trouble, I wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people.	Oh, I think this really sucks.
"You see white people have names like ""Lenny,"" whereas, black people have names like ""Carl."""	All right, let's get this geezer out quick so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators.
Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.	That didn't go well, did it?
Ooo, Arthur Fortune. You know what that fabulous man just did? He gave the Springfield zoo two male Pandas, and got them to mate successfully.	Oh... What's the use? I'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire like Arthur Fortune.
Oh, yeah! And I'm not easily impressed. Wow! A blue car!	And a stunt like that impresses people?
A sober Irishman?	Well, if a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, I'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time.
Whew, that was one long helicopter ride.	Even rarer.
Do you really think you can capture the Loch Ness Monster? I mean, he's eluded Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves.	Whew, that was one long helicopter ride.
Hey, Willie. That old couple looks just like you.	Ach. The whole town's turned out. I've never seen them so excited.
Good. Good. One more.	Aye.
Uh, to work in your power plant?	Where's my monster, Tubby? What do you people think I'm paying you for?
Check.	The beast looks something like this, only without the saucy t-shirt.
Tilt? You monster!	He's been down in that icy water for hours! How can the lad survive such brutal punishment?
Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. Besides, I'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!	We're the laughingstock of the town.
Can you believe I'm a size four? Woo!	Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. Besides, I'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!
No way! Aberdeen rules!	Nay. 'Tis merely Loch Ness High School's discarded Homecoming float.
Well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that insane rampage.	LOVE MEEEE!
But you know what? To be loved you have to be nice to people. Every day! But, to be hated, you don't have to do squat.	Well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that insane rampage.
Come on, Nessie. One more pull.	Tough luck, Simpson.
Shuuuut uppa you mouth.	I was really starting to enjoy Ethnic Mismatch Comedy #644. I've never heard so many Viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
All right, a gross-out contest! Grandma Plopwell, you've done it again.	"Sponsored by ""Grandma Plopwell's."" The low-fat pudding that's approved for sale... by the government!"
I'm hot buttered / Check it and see / I got a fever of four fifty-three...	"Next up, Homer and his amazing Reddenbacher dreamcoat, with a number he calls, ""Kernel Knowledge."""
I'm hot... so very hot...	I'm hot buttered / Check it and see / I got a fever of four fifty-three...
Fours?	I'm hot... so very hot...
Ow! Ow! Oh!	Fours?
Judges can't win the contest! Booooo!	All right, judges? Who is our winner?
Look, I got runner-up prize.	An Open Letter to the People of Springfield: Today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding.
No. But I got it.	You won second place?
Stealing is wrong.	No. But I got it.
"""Free Boudoir Photography."" Sweet."	Stealing is wrong.
Hm...	"""Free Boudoir Photography."" Sweet."
Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale.	Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?
Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. I'm gonna read it just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here.	Dad, stop kidding around. Look, they printed my letter.
I envy them.	Well, I'm sure someone had the time to read it.
Hello, I have a certificate for a free erotic photo session.	Wow. Me... fit in.
Uh... Geraldo... Simpson.	Oh, yes. Your name?
Who told you?	All right, Mr. Simpson...
Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?	Don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal. Many husbands use them as a romantic gift for their wives.
"Well, I don't, but the Block Association seems to. They wanted a ""traditional"" Santa Claus."	Well, yes, unless you have some issues with revealing your body.
Oh, that's great, honey. You tell me everything you can before the commercial's over.	Oh Dad, I just spent the day with the most wonderful people.
Up-bup-bup-bup.	Well, for the first time in my life I feel that someone understands...
Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?	Are you ready in there, Mr. Simpson?
Please be kind.	Just come out.
Now you're sure this will save my marriage?	You look fantastic. Let me just adjust my lens here.
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!	That's too clever. You're one of them!
Okay, I think he's gone.	Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!
Let's reschedule.	Okay, I think he's gone.
Gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here.	The world has already taken note of our accomplishments. Springfield has moved up to number two ninety-nine on the list of America's three hundred most liveable cities. Take that, East St. Louis!
It's time to get Homer-erotic.	All right, let's do this thing.
I've got something for you.	Maarge. Oh, Maaarge.
Houston, we have a problem. A sexy problem.	Oh, Homie.
Grrr. I'm gonna to maul you.	Homie? Well, look at you...
No, no. It's just our basement.	Wooh, wooh. Look at those silk pillows. It's like the set of some high-class porno film!
Yeah, so? Come on! More kissing!	Hold on, wha-- That's our basement?
But I was gonna score...	It looks so elegant. And all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. You've got to show me exactly what you did.
Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!	Silence. I don't need anyone to talk for me except this voice-box. You have clearly been corrupted by power. For shame!
Now's our opening. Come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!	Oh!
Did you have fun with your robot buddy?	Lisa, thank God you're okay.
I am.	Who's up for some beers?
Wow. I can't believe someone I never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.	Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing, Homer. I may have to steal it.
Yes, I did.	I didn't say that.
"Hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of ""Weird"" was here?! I love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies."	Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!
"""Gigabytes!"" They've done it again. Gigabytes. Wait, this isn't ""Weird."" Why, there's no magazine called ""Weird,"" is there?"	Dad, it's not...
The Internet? Is that thing still around?	Hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in Springfield! Will you take me, Dad? Please? I'll show you how to order pizza over the Internet...
Come on, Lisa! Monkeys!	Bart! The Internet is more than a global pornography network. It's a...
Oh yeah. I'm betting on Jai-Alai in the Cayman Islands, I invested in something called News Corp...	Wow, Dad, you're surfing like a pro.
Ahh! Undo! Undo! Uhh.	Dad, that's Fox!
Well, let's check the old bank account.	Dad, do we have any money left?
See? Even after all my cyber-squandering we've still got twelve hundred dollars.	Well, let's check the old bank account.
"You seem to know an awful lot about this for an ""innocent person."""	We were robbed?!
Ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, I'll get us the money. Even if I have to get a second job.	We were saving that money for our family vacation. Now we're gonna have to start all over again.
Yes, sir.	Evening, neighbor. Low on funds again?
I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.	Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay.
It's just that you and Maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while I got Marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive.	I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
They're years ahead of us.	It's just that you and Maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while I got Marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive.
Well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine...	Oh, we're not as well-off as you think. We give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. And the Leftorium's business has gone way downhill since Leftopolis moved in next door.
Sweet.	Oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. They were evidence in a murder trial!
Go on...	We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar.
Maybe you're right, Ned. Maybe you're right.	I think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
There's only three left in the world!	Are you tired of missing out on the good things in life? Family vacations, jet packs, Solid Gold dancers...
I'm squeezing... I'm squee-zing it. Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand.	Squeeze every penny! Squeeze every penny!
Wow, this plankton's only 33 cents.	Eww...
Sure, by their standards, but we live in America.	Um, according to the Mexican Council of Food, this expired two years ago.
But it's so cheap.	This also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
Well, let's see what's in the ol' vacation fund.	But it's so cheap.
"A little late for ""could've's,"" Marge."	Homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom.
No, mon, let's go home to Jamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long.	Come on, Transylvania.
No, no Japan. Jamaica! I wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side.	C'mon, Homer! Japan!
Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?	Never mind. Looks like the Flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
C'mon!	Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?
That's not how I remember it. Besides, if we want to see Japanese people we could have gone to the zoo.	"Come on, Homer, Japan will be fun. You liked ""Rashomon."""
What? The guy who washes the elephants is Japanese. His name is Takashi. He's in my book club.	Homer!
Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom.	I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies.
It's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.	Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom.
Marge, they stole my idea!	To-ga! To-ga! Toga 2000!
Here's our room!	Welcome to Japan, folks. The local time is: tomorrow.
I don't have time for that.	Homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open.
Ohh, yeah...	Mom, Lis! Check it out. Dad's on TV.
Oh, all right.	What the--?
Whew. All that seizing made me hungry.	Robots be right back.
The toilet recommended a place called AmericaTown.	Me too. Let's go to an authentic Japanese noodle house!
I can't believe they stuck us at Taxachusetts.	"We now return to ""Battling Seizure Robots!"""
Hey, you know, I once knew a man from Nantucket.	I can't believe they stuck us at Taxachusetts.
Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.	And?
Oooh, they got our number.	Don't ask me! I don't know anything! I'm product of American education system. I also build poor quality cars and inferior-style electronics.
It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.	Oh my goodness, Homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, of course. You're right. You know, I read about a Shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... Run, Bart!	But you promised me we'd do something Japanese.
Looks like he's doing a commercial.	Hey, look. Isn't that Woody Allen?
Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, what's Baby Huey doing?	What did I do to deserve this? Oh, right.
Hmmm...	Says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring.
Spare some salt, tubby?	Hmmm...
Hey, that's mine!	Tubby?
"Like we say in my country, ""Hasta la vista, baby."""	Hey, that's mine!
Yeah, and I'm Clobbersaurus.	Congratulations. I am the Emperor and...
Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.	Your wife has paid your bail, Mr. Simpson-san.
Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori.	Now can we do something Japanese?
I didn't... What is it? Lunch?	Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori.
Don't worry, ichiban. I'll show you something Japanese.	Honey, I know you want to see Japan, but we're down to our last million yen.
It's a crane. The Japanese believe they bring good luck.	Oh, it's beautiful, Dad.
Shimatta baka-me!	Be careful. We need that money to get home.
This sucks. What else is on?	KNIFE-AH GOES IN, GUTS-AH COME-AH OUT, THAT'S-AH WHAT OSAKA SEAFOOD CONCERN IS ALL ABOUT.
Well, I haven't talked it over with the family, but I think we'd all like a free dinner at AmericaTown.	Don't patronize me! Now, Simpson family, have you picked a wish?
Ignor-- what?	Now our gameshows are a little different from yours. Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance.
"Do ""OW THAT HURTS."""	"Okay, let's begin. Our categories are ""OW, THAT HURTS,"" ""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?"" and ""PLEASE LET ME DIE."""
Could someone please whack my hernia back in?	I had an inkling.
Is the answer Japan?	Mr. Simpson, we'll cut you down as soon as you answer one question about Japan.
Why are you so cruel?	Congratulations Simpsons, the airline tickets are yours. All you have to do is to pick them up...from inside that volcano.
Well, at least we're past the lightning round.	This vacation really blows.
Hmmm, I see... I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round.	Well, at least we're past the lightning round.
Marge! Your shoe!	Lisa!
Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock.	Oh, I'm afraid this might be the end.
It burns! It burns!	Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock.
It burns! It burns!	"Don't worry, that ""lava"" is just Orangeade made by our sponsor, Osaka Orangeade Concern."
Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame.	It's loaded with wasabi. Kudos, Simpsons, you have won your freedom!
I love this show. Take that, you stupid hosers!	Sting those Canucks.
Undo! Undo!	When we get to thirty-five thousand feet, he usually does let go. So, from there on out all we have to do is worry about Mothra and uh, we do have reports he's tied up with Gamra and Rodan at the present time. Thank you very much.
My children deserve to see me get a free gift.	Test drive the Elec-taurus today and get a free gift.
But I like the nice things you said about me.	I'm proud of you, Dad. Buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the Earth's supply... You're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?
Hello, I, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos.	Well, that shut me up.
What kind a mint?	Well, it's always nice to meet people concerned about the environment.
Yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too.	Boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier.
Relax, we're in an electric car.	Ah! Dad, you're headed for the harbor!
Hey, dolphins.	See? Everything's fine.
Oopsie.	Hey, dolphins.
Hi, girls.	Oopsie.
Ohhh.	Hi, girls.
Salt water seems to be good for it.	Ohhh.
Um, I'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. Can I have my prize now?	Salt water seems to be good for it.
We didn't? That's odd. Seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.	Hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is.
Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now.	I know, but we didn't.
Aww, movie tickets! That hardly seems worth destroying a car.	Perfect.
Who else is in it?	They're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring Mel Gibson!
Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny.	Who cares? Mel Gibson!
Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny.	Were you or Lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
Okay...	Besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. People magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... Homer, let's make love!
Uh, you're thinking about me, right?	Okay...
I will now.	Of course, Homey. Aren't you thinking about me?
Bo-ring.	"""And he fought for them once, for the only reason any man ever does. Because of one plain simple rule: Love thy neighbor..."""
At least the Jimmy Stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.	It's not boring. He's passionate about government.
Well, that was a stinker.	Excellent. / That man knows how to filibuster.
"Oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. I'll bet you would've hated it if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith."	I liked it. It was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing.
Got a pencil?	Eh, yes sir?
Thanks.	There you go.
stupid...	Thanks.
'Preciate it.	stupid...
Door, Marge.	But you promised to help me move! Ah, geeez!
And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!	I'm looking for Homer Simpson.
Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?	Quiet! Dad's gonna get his butt kicked by Mel Gibson! Knock his teeth out, Homer!
It symbolizes that she's my property and I own her.	Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?
Huh?	Mr. Simpson, I need your help.
Really? You want my help? Marge, did you hear that? Mel Gibson wants my help! Mel Gibson!	I think you're right about my movie and I want you to help me make it better.
Shuut-uup...	But, Dad, I thought you hated...
She's always doing that, Mel.	Don't sell your husband short, Mrs. Simpson.
Guilty as charged.	Homer is a brutally honest man, completely tactless and insensitive.
"You had me at ""Hello."""	I don't have much time, Homer. Will you come to Hollywood with me?
A mini-van... Oh boy, you celebrities sure know how to live. What is this? Toyota Previa?	Stop doing that, Mom.
Sweet.	Dodge Caravan.
Okay, while Mel and I are working, why don't you guys do the town? I hear all the stars eat at a place called Planet Hollywood.	I don't see any cameras.
Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks.	Can I stay with you, Dad?
Okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. Everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny.	Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks.
I mean Lisa.	Well even if he is, big deal.
Okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. It'll let us see your playful side.	I don't think so.
Yeah, but...	No.
They will if you set up that the dog is evil. All you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.	You want me to replace the villain with a dog? I mean nobody'll know what's going on!
Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...	Maybe this wasn't a good idea, Homer. I'm sorry I dragged you out here. L-Let me pay your bus fare home.
And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action.	The filibuster scene? That was Jimmy Stewart's favorite!
Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that.	You really think the end is boring?
It was symbolism. He was mad.	Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that.
Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?	Hmm, I guess it is a little flat. Okay, let's reshoot the ending. I'll call the hair and make-up ladies. You see if the teamsters will work for free.
... we-shot-last-night...	Okay, this new ending...
Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!	... is a little different than what we had, but I think you'll like it. It's missing some sound effects and the computer guys haven't added the twinkle in my eye...
Here comes two!	Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!
I second that motion...	I move we impose some serious term limits!
...with a vengeance!	I second that motion...
Those movies sucked. I only saw 'em to get Marge into the sack. PS: mission accomplished.	"But this was gonna be the studio's prestige picture. Like ""Howard's End,"" or ""Sophie's Choice."""
Yeah, guys like me.	I make movies for guys like him.
"Do the words ""Executive Producer"" mean anything to you?"	Who are you, anyway?
We'll talk.	Executive Producer?
Watch out! Comin' through! Mach schnell!	You put me down, you big lummox! Je-eedd!!
I'm on it.	Homer! Land mine!
How old are you, anyway?	'Night, Gus.
Sorry I asked.	Well, I've been told I can play anywhere from 28 to...
Oh, crap! Here they come!	Sorry I asked.
Hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. We're not finished yet.	Well, that's it Homer. We should've known better than to match wits with studio executives.
No time talk! Need steal car! Must save powerful but controversial movie!	Homer, what are you doing here?
Quick, Mel, get in!	Hel-lo.
"Movies aren't stupid! They fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""Lethal Weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."	Oh, forget it, Homer, let's just give 'em the stupid movie.
"Before ""Lethal Weapon 2"", I never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now I check every time."	That really wasn't my intention.
They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.	Movies mean that much to you, Homer?
No offense.	They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
Well, I think we lost 'em.	Oh sorry, honey, I used up the last roll on that man I thought was Judge Judy.
Oh, wait. There they are.	Well, I think we lost 'em.
Great idea, Mel. Now it's my turn.	I know, but he sells tickets. Let's go!
"I'm tired of running away. Did ""Braveheart"" run away? Did ""Payback"" run away? It's time we showed those suits what we're made of."	What are you doing?
"It's your plan, from ""Braveheart."" Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."	Will you please tell me the rest of the plan?!
Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it...	No, they didn't. They attacked us in a horribly bloody battle. Remember?
I think so.	Homer, are you okay?!
No.	I think so.
I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies.	That digital sound really lets you hear the blood splatter.
Okay, that's it. Let's get ready to meet our public.	I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies.
/ Ow!	I'm Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter and you'll be hearing from my attorney!
We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.	/ Ow!
Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel.	We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?	It's not your fault, Homer. I guess there's just no room in today's crazy, gentle America for violent dinosaurs like us.
Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture.	I blame the Internet. And the return of swing music.
Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everybody loves prequels.	Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture.
Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?	I don't.
No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery! You could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. Ooh, what about Indiana Jones? Does anyone own the rights to that?	Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?
Hey, Mel. I fell out.	No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery! You could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. Ooh, what about Indiana Jones? Does anyone own the rights to that?
Thank you for getting me out of work.	Thank you for coming.
Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right.	Your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that's good and true.
Hey, that looks like Bart.	But worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. Just look at this pattern.
Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer.	How should I know? The point is, A.D.D. makes children restless and easily distracted.
Candy bar?	... Unless you're willing to try a radical, untested, potentially dangerous...
I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.	Good Lord. He's gotten into the Pep Closet!
They become your slaves...	Check this out.
It's all about trust, honey.	How will we get Bart to take these?
Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.	Medication?
Sure you do. All your favorite stars have used drugs: Brett Butler.... Tim Allen...	I don't want to take drugs.
Andy Dick...	Tommy Lee...
Yeah, and I'm a size four.	He's just flamboyant.
Why you little...!	Dad, I admit I have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer.
Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...	Nice try, Homer.
Ow!	Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...
Geez, what's the big deal? Look, I'll even eat some.	Ow!
Now--	Geez, what's the big deal? Look, I'll even eat some.
Way to guilt him, Marge!	All right. I'll do it for you.
Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...	"No, but here's a book called ""Chicken Soup for the Loser"" that gave Bill Buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats."
Well, I have been thinking about making them into cut-offs...	I think it's the bright blue pants. I mean, you're not on a golf course.
I tell ya, the kid's a wonder. He organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action.	Well, I have been thinking about making them into cut-offs...
You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.	That's gonna save all kindsa travel time.
Got my whole week in there.	You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.
"Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. No, wait... I'll make it say ""Whatsa matta you?"" in Turkish."	Quiet, everybody!
And look at this. A cheese grater!	Neyin War? Dérdine?
Well, if you want one, they sell 'em at...	A guy could do great things with a gadget like that.
The boy's still studying?	Yeah, a guy could do great things...
He's gone from Goofus to Gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills.	That's right. You stay on the ball, you stay on the wall.
Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday.	Bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and I could have a night out!
Oh... Marge!	I was thinking of something a little more... adult.
Really? With butterscotch on it?	And then afterwards...
Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband.	All right, girls, tops off. It's showtime!
Well, sure, if it's true.	I heard about a new bar where men dance with men. Doesn't that sound adorable?
Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?	I'm so glad you're here. Bart's really acting funny.
Even mine?	It can read your electronic organizer from space.
Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!	Even mine?
Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!	Who else? Major League Baseball.
Hey, you found my needlenose pliers.	Aagghh!
Wake up, honey!	Any other strange behavior?
He quit blinking. He says that's when they get ya.	Wake up, honey!
After we trusted you...	This carboxyl group sometimes causes problems.
Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have a tummyache.	No!
We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea...	Oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero.
But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?	I don't think he has diarrhea.
So I gave up tap for jazz, and I've never regretted it. And here's why...	Why'd you have to yell? You ruined the whole shower.
I'm on top of it.	Homer, you're supposed to be hunting for Bart!
My God, is she brave. Standing up to that freaked-out junkie.	What a day. First the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this!
Why don't you just tell everybody?	Dad, that junkie is your son!
The frame store! You monster!	Not the church! Jesus lives there!
And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.	Hey, at least I got to see some cool colors.
Who cares? That man can really slug.	Why is the zero made out of glass?
Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's got it covered.	Dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?
God bless you, Nelson Muntz.	Dingus!
Hey, you , you cut me off! Ah, yeah, you!	I'm no hero. I just like to hit people in the head.
Oh, right. ambulance! Think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards.	Dad, that's an ambulance.
Here we are kids -- the zoo.	Oh, right. ambulance! Think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards.
If he's so smart, how come he's dead?	Welcome to the Springfield Shopper, established in 1883. The newspaper was founded by Johnny Newspaperseed... a fourteen-year-old boy who roamed America, founding newspapers.
Ooo... pointless nostalgia.	Check it out, Dad. You can print out the headline from the day you were born.
I'd sure hate to be him.	Ooo... pointless nostalgia.
"Hey, I smell cake! Cake that says ""Farewell"" and ""Best Wishes""!"	Zero. Zero's a per cent.
I'll have you know I wandered off from the tour.	Who are you and why are you ruining my retirement party?
Oh, I like food all right.	Well, at least you like the food.
I LIKE PIZZA / I LIKE BAGELS / I LIKE HOT DOGS, WITH MUSTARD AND BEER...	Oh, I like food all right.
I'LL EAT EGGPLANT / I COULD EVEN EAT A BABY DEER... LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... WHO'S THAT BABY DEER ON THE LAWN, THERE...	I get the picture.
Sorry.	Enough already!
No, it usually takes a few hours.	Hey, listen, I just had a thought. We're looking for a new food critic. Someone who doesn't immediately pooh-pooh everything he eats.
Thanks for the chance. You won't never regret this, Mr. Editing Guy!	Look, I'd like to give you a tryout. Write a 500 word sample review. If it passes muster, we'll put you on staff.
"We don't need no stinkin' ""E"". Restaurant Review... No. Eatery Evaluation... No. Food box... Go or no go? By Homer... No. Earl. No. Bill Simpson!"	"You know, Homie, the ""E"" doesn't work on that typewriter."
Well -- what do you think?	"We don't need no stinkin' ""E"". Restaurant Review... No. Eatery Evaluation... No. Food box... Go or no go? By Homer... No. Earl. No. Bill Simpson!"
What's wrong with it?	This is a joke, right? I mean, this is the stupidest thing I've ever read.
It was so hard to get to 500 words...	"Well, you keep using words like ""pasketti"" and ""momatoes,"" you make numerous threatening references to the U.N., and at the end, you repeat the words ""Screw Flanders"" over and over again..."
No, no, you're right. It's a joke. Everyone laugh at the funny joke . I'll be right back with the real review.	Aw, look, Homer, I'm sorry, but...
Still not clean! Stink of failure still on me!	No, no, you're right. It's a joke. Everyone laugh at the funny joke . I'll be right back with the real review.
Still not clean! Still not clean!	I'll help you write a new review if you just let me use the bathroom!
Okay, what restaurant should we review?	Still not clean! Still not clean!
Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious...	Well, we went to Paté Labelle last week. How 'bout that?
That's brilliant. And they have this sweet, sweet chocolate mousse -- really, the only word for it is .	The food is delicious.
How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?	Hm. What's the English equivalent for ? I'd say... transcendent.
We make a good team. A groin-grabbingly good team!	Uh, I don't think so.
"How about ""screw Flanders""?"	497... 498 words. Hmph.
Aw, they're both good.	Bon Appetit.
Woo hoo! Stop the presses!	Not bad... not bad at all. We're gonna run this on page one! Of Section H-2.
Okay, start the presses!	Woo hoo! Stop the presses!
Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.	That takes four hours!
Marge, shh! It's important that no one know that I'm a food critic.	This is so exciting, Homie. Your first restaurant review.
Can ya believe it, Marge? This job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!	If anything appears to be moving, that's just freshness. Arrr.
Why you little...	Yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, we'll be on easy street.
Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. But this is only the beginning...	Wow, my first published article. Although someone else's name is on it.
"There's the coffee mug from ""Heartbeeps""!"	Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. But this is only the beginning...
Let me see.	And there's that awful script from The Cable Guy!
Stupid script! Nearly wrecked Jim Carrey's career! You-- I'm gonna... What?	Let me see.
And the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.	The food is exquisite...
Look, Marge, I'm making a difference in people's lives!	I never knew everything was so good.
Are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?	Hey Homer, c'mere!
Whew.	No.
"Why, you... You made them cancel ""Platypus Man!"""	Some of your fellow critics wanted to meet you ... this is Garth Trelawny, TV critic...
And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!	Homer! This is our Theater Critic, Daphne Beaumont.
Sorry.	Homer, please!
For you, perhaps.	Jamie Kilday, farm supply critic. Just got back from the gopher poison show in Paris. Let me tell you something, people. The days of clubbing them with a baseball bat are over.
I've given out my share of bad reviews.	Listen, we've been meaning to have a talk with you about your reviews. Everything's a rave! Nine thumbs up? What the hell is that?
It lost some points 'cause it had a Hot Wheel on it.	Well, the only bad review you gave was to a slice of pizza you found under the couch.
Oh, that's classic.	"Good Lord, man, you're a critic! You don't have to like everything. E.g., my latest review: ""We see John Deere has come out with this year's line of rototillers. Surprise surprise, they're green. I say it's time to send John Deere a 'Dear John.'"""
Okay.	You don't have to patronize me.
Hm. This pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy.	It's not!?
The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.	Dad, that's so mean.
Always.	But what if someone bad tells me to...
"Ah, not bad... if lasagna is Italian for ""pile of puke."""	Tough crowd. They're booing Shakespeare!
Well, I hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. Hm, I seem to be missing a piece of my ear. Touché!	I chop-a you good!
Mm.	Who wants pork chops?
Sorry, Marge. I'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up.	Mm.
"Marge, I'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""Shake"" and ""Bake."""	You always liked my pork chops.
People change, Marge. My palate has grown more sophisticated.	You like Shake and Bake. You used to put it in your coffee.
Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!	Oh, yeah? What's a palate?
So come to The Legless Frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. P.S. Parking was ample.	Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!
People will think what I tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!	Dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?
Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back.	Not anymore. I don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
"I don't need Lisa to write a good review. ""The food at the Gilded Truffle really..."" Uh... What's a good word?"	Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back.
"""Rough!"" Ah, I don't know. You've been pitching that all night."	Ruff!
"""Chewy!"" That's inspired."	Chewy?
Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.	"Homer, what gives with this review? You say the salad tastes like ""bark"", the potatoes were very . This reads like it was written by a dog."
Really? Like what?	"Listen, you gotta shape up. Next week is the ""Taste of Springfield"" festival, and you'll be reviewing every restaurant in town. Remember, people have certain expectations about the Lifeways section."
Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere.	Homie, my women's intuition's acting up. Something bad's going to happen if you go in there.
A bat! Now that's a new one.	Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere.
So what are you up to, young lady?	A bat! Now that's a new one.
Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me.	I'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
Pedestrian.	Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me.
Uninspired.	Pedestrian.
I didn't say stop!	Uninspired.
Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie...	We can find him faster by splitting up. You take fried foods. You take salty snacks. I'll take desserts. Break!
Ooh, sweet.	A rude Frenchman? Well, I never!
Eh, I've had a good run.	It's gonna kill you!
Noooo!	Don't! Uh... um... It's low-fat!
Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the bad things I said about you.	Oh, he likes eggs.
Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get my comeuppance, and I never will.	What bad things? Why?
I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!	Uh, Dad?
Finally getting my comeuppance.	I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!
But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.	I still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp...	But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.
Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...	I'm having a hard time seeing. Homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?
He's dead!	Ned Flanders!
He's definitely dead!	He's dead!
Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is...	They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts.
To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead.	Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is...
Hey Maude! Look who's helping me clean the chimney.	To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead.
Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily.	Neddy? Where have you been?
Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies.	Oh, I'm so relieved. Whenever you go on one of your late night fog walks, I get so worried.
Wow, it sure is slippery up here.	Well, come on down, you goofy roofy.
Aww, she missed it.	My pies are done!
Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having a heart attack.	Aww, she missed it.
Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.	And that's the end of that chapter.
When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over...	... And now Ned's best friend will say a few words. Homer?
Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife.	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
We'll miss you, buddy.	Stop winking.
Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy.	We'll miss you, buddy.
You know, I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse.	Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy.
But you got to kill...	No more murders.
Y'ello?	Who could be calling at this hour?
Who is this?	I know you're alone.
No, it's Homer.	Is this Maude Flanders?
Lisa, the pet cemetery.	Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park.
Bart, spooky roller disco.	Lisa, the pet cemetery.
And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.	Bart, spooky roller disco.
Now, Flanders, I want you to...	And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
He's undead, all right.	You can't kill the undead, silly.
Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?	Yeah...
Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood.	Remember, you're vulnerable to Kryptonite!
Absolutely.	Hey, Homer. Weren't you the plant's Y2K Compliance Officer?
Doin' what now?	It musta been hard debugging all those computers, huh Homer?
That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be terrified.	You did fix them, right Dad? Because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world.
Uh-oh.	Oh, no. It's happening.
Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed...	There goes the clothesline.
Hey, this milk's broken.	Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed...
Stop! Ow!	It's got a computer chip in it. Everything does.
I'm caught on something!	They're looting the mall. Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers!
But I was gonna loot you a present!	I don't want you looting!
Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?	Well, look at the wonders of the computer age now.
Implied, Lisa? Or implode?	I think that was implied by what I said.
Thank you, sweet clown.	They're evacuating the Earth! We're saved!
In death you saved us all.	Thank you, sweet clown.
I can still hear his voice on the wind.	I'm not dead!
Just like the dead clown promised.	There it is!
That's us!	They must be starting a new civilization on Mars with our best and brightest.
"Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie ""Shine."""	Name please.
Uh... Shiny McShine?	Uh-huh. And your name is?
Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage.	Love ya lots!
Well, son. I guess this is the end. But we've both had long, full lives. Oh, right.	Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage.
And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!	Hey, look, another spaceship!
I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.	And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!
You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.	Are you still talking about the Earth?
Ooh, there's Ross Perot, Dr. Laura, Spike Lee...	You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.
Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?	Wait a minute. They're not so great.
Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?!	Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?
So we're all gonna die?	Yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth? I mean, my shows weren't great, but I never tied people up and forced 'em to watch. And I could've. 'Cause I'm a big guy. And I'm good with knots.
The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!	'Fraid so. But hey, the grub's pretty good, huh?
Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell.	Hey, turn those frowns around!
Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad.	Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell.
Not fast enough!	Don't worry, Dad. We'll be dead in five minutes.
I have to go to ze lobby!	Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either.	I'm sorry, but we're not supposed to put butter on the Milk Duds.
To the top please.	Touché.
Swim, my pretties.	To the top please.
Sh-sh-shh!	Your honor has been insulted! This will not stand.
Sir, I demand satisfaction.	Why that little... He insulted your honor!
I challenge you to a duel.	Are you crazy, dude?
Will you duel, or are you a coward?!	The dude is crazy!
"Uh, uh. ""H"" is for Homer."	My hero!
Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?	Yeah, thanks. It's just past the end of the bar, next to the heavyset guy.
No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted my honor.	All right, take it easy. Take it easy. I'm just saying you ain't no, uh, Tommy Tune.
I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.	I-- Your what now?
Really? But you've never given anyone a free beer.	Hey, a duel? I, ah-- Isn't that a little extreme? Here, here, have a free beer.
Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP...	Yeah, I ain't never been slapped with no duelin' glove before, either.
BABY, GLOVE SLAP...	Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP...
Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...	GLOVE SLAP / BABY GLOVE SLAP / GLOVE SLAP / I DON'T TAKE CRAP / GLOVE SLAP / SHUT YOUR BIG YAP...!
Huh?	Suh, your challenge is accepted.
Aisle six?	You'll need a will and headstone, aisle six.
Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this?	Aisle six?
Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?	Yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you.
Oh.	Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?
Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glove kept slapping people and I was getting blamed.	Oh.
He's out there, isn't he?	Oh, no!
Save me, Marge. I saved you!	Hey, I'm not dead yet.
Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go.	Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.	Looks like you were saved by a Christmas tree.
Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?	And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu...	Oooh, yes indeedy, Homer. Looks like they're settling in for a long stay.
Ah, screw it.	To continue talking, please deposit ten cents.
Ooh! How 'bout that house?	Where are we gonna live?
Lousy show-offs.	That has people living in it. You can see them through the windows.
Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum.	Yeah, git yer own habitat.
Come on, move it!	Come back here! Why, you yellow belly...
How should I know?	Where are we going, Dad?
'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?	Then why are you driving so fast?
Zo-rrooo!	'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
"""Rural route 9?"" That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!"	Zo-rrooo!
Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides...	You mean Grampa's old farm?
Race ya to the swimmin' hole!	What a dump!
Com'on, Maw. Bring the young 'uns! There's no leeches! Lots of snakes, though.	Race ya to the swimmin' hole!
Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.	Holy moly, we can't stay here. It's full of raccoons.
Hello, kitty.	Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.
You little scamp.	Hello, kitty.
Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.	Are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!	I'll repress the rage I'm feeling.
All right, let's see what the old girl can do.	That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
Hang on.	It doesn't sound very tractor-y.
And... there.	Hang on.
Now we're talkin'!	And... there.
Go get Lassie.	Dad!
This car was made in Guatemala.	Well, well, look at the city slicker pullin' up in his fancy German car.
I bought these shoes from a hobo.	Well pardon us, Mr. Gucci loafers.
I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming.	Well la-dee-da, Mr. Park-Avenue manicure.
Aw, what do you know?	You're not gonna grow nothin' on the old Simpson place. That's why your daddy abandoned it.
Oh, that's just superstition.	Well, I know your soil pH is up around 9.6, and you need it seven to eight, max.
You watch me. I'll grow something out there.	Oh, that's just superstition.
Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that.	Wow, Dad, this is the juiciest watermelon I ever tasted.
Oh, a little bit of everything.	What are you planting?
Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil.	Oh, a little bit of everything.
And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... I'm down.	Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil.
Move the handbrake...	Paw!
Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?	Ohhh, that's heaven.
I'm only one man, Marge.	Maybe it needs more fertilizer.
Leave me alone, you big bully.	Well, if it isn't Mr. Salad Fork. You couldn't grow stink on a monkey.
Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out.	Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at Krusty-Burger.
Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow...	Wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?
Wait a minute.	Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow...
Easy... careful... steady...	I hear that.
Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.	Easy... careful... steady...
Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?	Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.
Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.	It's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?
Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope.	You got that from a movie poster!
"From the producers of ""Waiting to Exhale."""	Where'd you get that?
Shut up and kiss me.	Is that plutonium on your gums?
It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!	Shut up and kiss me.
"That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."	But it's only been one night.
Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.	Yeah, but didn't Grasshopperus kill Chad Everett?
Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time.	Oh.
Ta-da!	Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time.
All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible.	Ta-da!
Ah-ha!	All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible.
Oh... Where are you?	Ah-ha!
Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn.	Oh, honey, give it up.
This better be good.	Wait, Dad, you don't have to kill yourself.
A sprout!	Something's growing.
And there's some more!	A sprout!
Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!	What is it? Carrots? Peas? Maybe it's okra.
Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup.	Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!
Bup, no fighting, boys.	Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup.
Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants.	Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
Addictive, eh?	It does. But it's smooth and mild. And refreshingly addictive.
Aw, thanks honey.	"""ToMacco?"" That's pretty clever, Dad. I mean, for a product that's evil and deadly."
Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?	"Excuse me, Mr. Farmer man. I promised my son he could tip over his first cow, and I... ""ToMacco?"""
Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone.	I was here first! / C'mon, c'mon people!
You're scaring the customers, honey.	Don't forget your mincemeat pie!
Okay.	Hello, folks. Would you and your family like to take a ride with us?
Those dirty rotten...	Homer, we're in a bit of a pickle. Kids are crazy about tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them.
I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one man.	Those dirty rotten...
How much?	"Tell me about it. But there's no law against selling kids tomacco. That little ""M"" is worth a lot of money to us... and to you."
One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?	... million dollars.
Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there.	One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?
Oh, yeah. Let's take it.	Shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.	I'm with Lisa. Let's take 'em to the cleaners.
They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...	We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
Stop eating our future!	They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!	Stop eating our future!
Thank God, there's one left!	Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!
I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin.	You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. You've gotta destroy this plant.
I agree, but how?	Just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...	Now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
No, I'd rather die!	Give them the plant, Homer!
Take it!	No, I'd rather die!
So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?	Well! What a lovely gift. Gotta run!
Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock?	So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?
Mindy?	Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock?
Mindy and I are just hammering out a payment plan. We'll talk Monday!	Mindy?
I don't know why we ever left in the first place.	I've never been so glad to be home.
Hey, are we duellin' or what?	I don't mind if I do.
I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.	You okay, Dad?
After pie.	Dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for.
Snooze... need more snooze.	GLOVE SLAP / SHUT YOUR BIG YAP / GLOVE SLAP / BABY GLOVE SLAP / OOHH, GLOVE THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT YEAH / GLOVE BABY GIVE IT A SLAP / GLOVE SLAP I DON'T TAKE CRAP / GLOVE SLAP / SHUT YOUR BIG YAP / A GLOVE SLAP TO A LITTLE OL' FACE WILL GET YOU / SA-TIS-FAC-TION / GLOVE SLAP BA-BY...!
Did somebody say num num?	Num num, Maggie. Num num.
Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No time for Maggie.	I can't get Maggie to eat. Maybe if you try...
Oooh, where's Waldo?	Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No time for Maggie.
Nope. Nope. This would be a lot easier without all these people. Nope. Nope. It's there-- Uh, nope.	Oooh, where's Waldo?
Waldo, where are you?!	Homer!
Over there.	All right, smart guy. Where's the fire?
Heh, heh. I'd hate to see the look on ol' Burnsie's face if he knew I was just gettin' in. Hee hee.	Okay, you just bought yourself a 3-17: pointing out police stupidity. Or is that a 3-14? Nah, nah, a 3-14 is a dog, ah in... no, or is that a 3-15? You're in trouble, pal.
No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.	Turn around, Simpson.
Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.	Hey Homer, what gives?
Okay.	Hey, you wanna come bowling with us tonight?
Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it.	Hello? Homer? Where are you? You promised you were going to have a tea party with Maggie.
The cooling tank just blew and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.	Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it.
Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what I really want.	Oh no, not Lenny. Not Lenny!
Are poo and ass taken?	Poo. Uh, Homer, what wacky name do you want?
Damn! Could my life get any worse?!	Yeah.
Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on a bowling ball?	Simpson! Even for a bowler, you're fat!
What a rotten day!	Uhh, actually, I'd say you're having a severe psychotic episode.
Really?	Hey, Homer. That's four strikes in a row. You got a perfect game going!
Lenny...	Ah, this split you sold me is making me choke.
Practice ball! Practice ball!	Ow!
Real real real real real!	Practice ball! Practice ball!
Woo hoo!	Real real real real real!
Ow!	Ho-mer! Ho-mer! Ho-mer!
Woo hoo! I'm ten pins away from perfection.	Ow!
Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.	Now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. So we'll just stay here and not disturb him.
Get down, get down, get down!	This is as fast as I move now.
Woo hoo! This is the greatest day of my life!	Get down, get down, get down!
In your face, to-do list!	You did it, Homie!
Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl.	Ho-mer! Ho-mer!
Thank you, Bart's teacher. You know, kids, my teachers said I would never amount to anything. And until last week, they were dead right. But now I've achieved perfection.	Mr. Simpson bowled a perfect game without the aid of steroids, crack, angel dust, or the other narcotics that are synonymous with pro bowling.
Any questions?	Thank you, Bart's teacher. You know, kids, my teachers said I would never amount to anything. And until last week, they were dead right. But now I've achieved perfection.
Yes, Bart's weird friend.	Any questions?
You've got a father. He's just a dud.	Will you be my Dad?
Next question.	You've got a father. He's just a dud.
Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on.	Next question.
Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?	Do you think I could grow up to be a doctor?
Hey, this was supposed to be about me. Now, any other questions? Pumpkin face? Headgear? Chicken pox? Smelly? Lazy eye? Spikey head? Okay, class dismissed. Rock on!	Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?
Yes, Kent?	Uhhh, Homer...
"Well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do I read from the sheet labeled ""Jokes"" or ""Answers?"""	According to Redbook Magazine, what is the speed of light?
Dream on, Drunky!	Make me center square, Kent! I'm ready. I can handle it.
Flavor of the month? Me?	Ohh, we've got to stop putting these flavors of the month on.
I 'unno... Because you weren't cute anymore?	Yeah, Homer, you can't just ride one accomplishment forever. Why do you think I stopped acting and became a director?
Hello, everybody!	Now to save my partner's life, I'll need complete...
Did somebody say a perfect game?	Hello, everybody!
I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?	You idiot! You'll ruin everything!
Hey, I thought you never talked.	Would you shut up?!
Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!	He'll do it! I'm not the first Teller!
Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again.	That's right! You are!
That's right. You've got a special daddy.	Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again.
Woo hoo! First stop, Maude Flanders.	"Burt Reynolds, class act. Well now, for our segment, ""Yesterday's News""... featuring Homer Simpson. Are you as bored as I am with the antics of this warmed-over Fred Flintstone? I say it's time to put this one-trick pony out to stud."
But she said I...	Homer!
Lisa, I know what's going on here. They did it to Jesus and now they're doing it to me.	Dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside.
Well, in bowling ability.	Are you comparing yourself to our Lord?
Sweet bowling alley balloon. You're my only friend.	Well, in bowling ability.
What was that about?	Sweet bowling alley balloon. You're my only friend.
Marge, has my life peaked?	What was that about?
Mm-hmmm.	Ohhh, Homey, is that what's bothering you?
You're right!	Well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
I can't believe it, Moe. The greatest feat of my life is already forgotten.	You're right!
Save your tears, Moe. Save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope.	Geez, Homer. I never seen you so depressed. As your life partner, I'm very worried.
THIS IS THE END / MY ONLY FRIEND, THE END / WEIRD SCENES INSIDE THE GOLD MINE...	Now where was I? Uh, two... three... Three radishes. Three big radishes.
Well, world, this is it. You know, I always thought you'd die before me. But now as I prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking...	THIS IS THE END / MY ONLY FRIEND, THE END / WEIRD SCENES INSIDE THE GOLD MINE...
I wanna live!	Hey, Mr. S. I didn't know you bungeed.
It's a glandular problemmmm!	No, no! You're too heavy!
Oooh, Morlocks... CHUDS... Mole People!	It's a glandular problemmmm!
Oh, Lord... you saved me. I guess you had some higher purpose in mind.	Well, except that.
Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy.	Oh, dumbass, trying to get yourself killed?
That's great. Even big stars take their kids to the zoo.	Look, I'd love to help you out, Homer, but I'm taking my kids to the zoo.
That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.	Daddy, we're missing the fantasti-potamus. She only sings twice a day!
No. I don't want your pity or your money.	Really? You have children? Oh, well look, here's some money.
I do what now?	Usually when you say that, you give the money back.
Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention.	Yoink!
I can see I'm not needed here.	If you tie a string around your finger real tight, you can make it turn purple.
Lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?	I can see I'm not needed here.
I've been so blind. I'll lavish my attention on Maggie, the forgotten Simpson.	"Sure! You can help me find three words where ""y"" is the vowel."
Mag-gie. It's me, Dad-dy!	I've been so blind. I'll lavish my attention on Maggie, the forgotten Simpson.
Daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. Yes he is. Yes he is.	Mag-gie. It's me, Dad-dy!
There you are.	Where's Mag-gie? Where's Mag-gie? Hey, where is she?
Hi Maggie! I'm Homie-Womie, the Teletubby. And I'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. Let's see what's on Tummy-vision!	There you are.
Ow! Ow, that hurts! Owww! Ohhh!	Hi Maggie! I'm Homie-Womie, the Teletubby. And I'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. Let's see what's on Tummy-vision!
Whee! Whee! Don't be scared, Maggie. Daddy won't drop you. Whee!	Ow! Ow, that hurts! Owww! Ohhh!
You're a tough cookie, Maggie, but I'm gonna win you over. Just like I did with Lisa.	Whee! Whee! Don't be scared, Maggie. Daddy won't drop you. Whee!
Hi, honey!	You're a tough cookie, Maggie, but I'm gonna win you over. Just like I did with Lisa.
Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!	C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me.
What are you pointing at? The ocean?	I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things between us had gotten this bad.
That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.	What are you pointing at? The ocean?
See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels.	That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.
Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.	See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels.
And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!	Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.
Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink to the bottom I can run to the shore.	And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!
Maggie! Call Aquaman!	Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink to the bottom I can run to the shore.
Oh, you do love me!	Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me.
Actually, that was before I went in the ocean.	Mr. Simpson, you're going to be fine. Although you do seem to have swallowed a number of shark eggs.
Then don't.	Well, I don't want to pry into your personal life...
Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on.	It's quite simple -- When a parent's life is in danger, a child can summon superhuman strength.
Good girl, Maggie. You knocked down all the pins. But you stepped over the line just a little bit, so I'll have to give you a five.	Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on.
And that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.	Good girl, Maggie. You knocked down all the pins. But you stepped over the line just a little bit, so I'll have to give you a five.
Looks like Daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby.	And that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.
And these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.	These Swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. I mean, a green table! I wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams.
Hey, there's someone else in here.	And these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.
He's named after what he is.	You put it together yourself. All you need is me, Allen Wrench.
Yes, I will have the... Pl_penlügen. And don't skimp on the D__dlemünch.	Oh! Manjula has begun to ovulate.
Hey, Apu, Manjula. You guys are still married?	Hello, Simpsons!
Pay up, Marge.	Oh, yes sir. Quite happily.
Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all.	Mm. On the other hand, monkey see, monkey do!
Hey Apu. Sittin' in the ice cream cooler, eh?	Oh, Calcutta!
Whoa, too much information! Thanks for the mental picture. Why don't you tell us what you really think?	By chilling my loins, I increase the chances of impregnating my wife.
Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream.	Just stop spouting those hackneyed quips.
More than I wanted to knoooow!	Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream.
But the cans seal in the flavor.	You know, Homer, you might want to open those cans before they explode.
So, how's the tribe comin' along? Any papooses?	O-kay.
Decided? That's classic. Decided. Babies just happen.	No, still no luck. Tell me, Homer, did you have to take any special steps when you decided to have children?
Really? On top and underneath?	Well, not to us they don't. Oh Homer, we have tried everything! Oysters, gravity boots, Sanjay's bed, every possible position...
Well, don't worry, I can help ya. I'm all about ideas.	Eh, yes.
Kids, come and get it!	Well, don't worry, I can help ya. I'm all about ideas.
Now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy.	Kids, come and get it!
"Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're ""Greg."""	I'm willing to play the high school jock, but did you have to cut the roof off my car?
My mistake. Stay in the moment.	"""Loosen up, baby. Tomorrow I'm shipping off to Vietnam."" I... I thought I was going to Ivy League State."
And that's my cue to exit.	Just promise not to forget me on your dinosaur-bone-digging-up trip...
I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. And that's my cue to exit.	Homer!
Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.	Oh, get lost.
Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies.	You have octuplets. It rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
Yeah. It looked just like that.	Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies.
Mine tasted like strawberry.	Mm-hmm. Well, that would only account for quintuplets. Did anyone else slip this woman fertility drugs?
Mmm... Ovulicious.	Mine tasted like strawberry.
Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and I'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets.	Yes, we have already received lifetime supplies of baby powder and Pepsi-B.
I've been waiting so long to hear that.	Gee, sorry for being born.
Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Hansel and Gretel are set for life.	I can't believe you don't shut up.
Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.	You know, I saw Apu today. He's really frazzled.
My corneas! You were saying?	Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.
Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?	Apu told me all eight babies have colic. Although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
Beautiful.	Yes, dear. From the nuclear plant.
Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this.	Knock, knock!
Marge... They've turned into jerks.	Oh look who's here, the family with one baby. How do you manage?
She's no Liza, but it works.	Let's hear it for Dazzle!
Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.	She's waking up!
There... and... there...	Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.
Not any more!	It's not just you prancin' around in a monkey suit, is it?
Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!	We'll do our best, Chutney-Butt.
What an age we live in.	When we come back, we'll show you the contents of a supermodel's stomach!
I remember television!	Hey, remember the fifties? Remember television, Coca-Cola, and Dick Clark?
Nah. We'll go next month.	Why don't we eat there tonight?!
Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like I've gone back in a time machine.	It's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
What an age we live in.	Dad, they have those everywhere.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance floor. Don't try and make me. If I have to get a divorce I will.	Dancing!
That's right, never!	Our grand prize tonight is a vintage 1955 Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you?	That's right, never!
Woo-hoo!	Well, well, well, I've never seen such reckless disregard for a wife's well-being in my life. You've just won yourselves a motorcycle!
It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my fellow... Get away from it!	Woo-hoo!
Promise you won't laugh?	Man, you're bending the hell out of that kick-stand, Dad. Why don't you just take it for a ride?
I don't know how.	Yeah, I promise.
A gang! That's the answer.	Yeah, you can arrest me, but you'll never defeat the Cobras. Nothing can defeat a motorcycle gang.
Remember to rebel against authority, kids.	Sweet hog, Mr. Simpson.
Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep.	Will you turn that engine off?
I know, I know. Just tune her out.	Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep.
Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers.	Look what you've done! You've ruined the display!
Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.	Never, pops.
You know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles.	Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.
This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos.	Hey, Homer! Can I join?
"The first meeting of ""Hell's Satans"" is called to order."	/ Bumper pool?! / You kiddin' me? You got bumper pool? / I'm there!
I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets.	The Chri... I-I-I don't think you understand my objection...
Can't hassle us, pig. We're goin' the speed limit. Oink, oink, oink.	Hell's Satans, huh? I'm watchin' you punks.
You can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the Cobras.	You'll make a mistake some day. And then you're going straight to juvie.
Oink! Oink! Oink!	Cobras? I thought you were the Hell's Satans.
How could I be down a thousand bucks?	Oink! Oink! Oink!
And what if we don't, Pops?	Get away from my store, you young hoodlums.
They printed my photo of our gang!	I know this is not your way, but we're in America now.
Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of that guy.	They printed my photo of our gang!
If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in.	You took a picture of me when I was asleep?
You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the...	We're the Hell's Satans, out of Bakersfield.
Okay.	Take off that jacket, man.
All right.	Now eat it.
Sorry.	Hey, hey, chew with your mouth closed, please.
Done.	Sorry.
Caps and frisbees, sir.	You got anything else with our logo on it?
And some pogs.	You gotta eat them, too.
Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter...	Yeah, it's part of being a lowlife.
But you have so much inner beauty.	Forget it, Simpson. Those pig noises you made really hurt my feelings -- looking like a pig as I do.
You're done. Next!	Hey! Hey! That's a leave-in conditioner!
Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!	No, we're not.
... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.	Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!
Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?!	And why aren't I at school?
Really? Read it.	Dad, there's a note on the back of your head.
Oh, that's sweet.	"Hm. ""Thanks for letting us crash in your pad. We had a very nice time."""
Now don't worry. I am gonna search high and low for your mother. But just in case I don't find her, I want you to contact this agency.	Well, good. I guess.
I just don't want to be alone.	"""Korean Love Brides""?!"
Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing...	I just don't want to be alone.
That's more like it. I'm looking for...	Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing...
"Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."	I'll show you.
Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn.	"Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."
I guess I'll never find her.	Yeah, I did see some bikers ride by here with a blue-haired woman, 'bout ten minutes ago. Said they were gonna spend the night at Crystal Lake Campground, Section K, Space 217. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever.	Homer, Homer, stop it! We've given up our violent ways. We just want to live peacefully, with your wife.
Uh-oh.	Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
You and me, chopper to chopper.	We both knew it would come to this.
Never! It was a gift from Newsweek!	Take your wallet.
Give me back my wife!	Homer!
Whaddaya say, honey?	Hey, can we at least keep her till the orgy in San Berdoo?
No dice!	No!
Taking care of some unfinished business.	Why are we stopping here?
Hey, why is this door locked?	Sis-ters are doin' it for themselves!
Oh, thank God.	Uh, we're drunk. Really drunk!
Where are the refreshments?	What will become of our kids?
Maybe you should shut up.	I've got a motorhome I never use. Maybe we should raffle it off.
Forget it. He releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: Feed the Children, Save the Whales, even Release the Hounds.	What about Mr. Burns? Maybe he'll help us out.
Get 'em, boy. Hit those smart-ass books.	Check it out. I'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level.
Uhh. Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? Is that what this is, Lisa?	This broom closet is not what it seems. It's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot.
So, who am I beating up?	Unless...
Now, let's see. This will make three Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined... two were kind of a draw...	Thus saving Christmas.
Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back...	All is calm / All is bright / Round...
Hah! If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that...	Yes. The madness ends here.
Please, Mr. Coleman. We can explain.	"Well, what do we have here? Looks like the biggest rip-off since ""Webster."""
Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics.	No, Bart, he's right. I did oversimplify.
I think what Lisa meant to say is...	Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics.
Hey, it is Christmas. We'd better get home.	Well, there's something you don't see every Christmas.
Um, uh... Mr. Coleman, I've been thinking... My wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... Aw, heck! Would you like to spend Christmas with us?	Hey, Dad... What if we...
I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.	Cloning is a troubling issue.
Get her! She's doing something!	Well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the...
Our junk!	She cleaned out the attic!
And the exits are sealed! Go to plan B!	Our junk!
Come on!	/ Push! /
Oh no you don't!	I'm tryin'! Stop yellin' at me!
Oh, precious heirlooms! Daddy would never let them take you.	Oh no you don't!
Useless? This flash cube has two flashes left!	I'll never get rid of this useless junk.
Hey, let's go skiing right now!	Look at these. You bought them after the Nagano Olympics, and never skied once. If you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe...
Woo hoo!	Yeah! Let's go skiing! / Yeah, Dad. Let's go!
Where?!	Look Dad, it's the drummer from Bread!
"Hmmm... ""The Widowmaker,"" Oh, that one's for the ladies. ""Spinebuster,"" boring. Ooh, ""Colostomizer."""	I'm sorry!
Don't hurt me! Here's my wallet.	"Hmmm... ""The Widowmaker,"" Oh, that one's for the ladies. ""Spinebuster,"" boring. Ooh, ""Colostomizer."""
Flanders!	Hi-didly-ho, Schuss in Boots.
That suit's a little revealing, isn't it?	Flanders!
Quit it! Must wash eyes! J--	Feels like I'm wearing nothin' at all!
Uh-oh.	Quit it! Must wash eyes! J--
Okay, don't panic. Remember what the instructor said...	Uh-oh.
Stupid sexy Flanders!	Feels like I'm wearin' nothin' at all. Nothin' at all, nothin' at all...
Ow, my legs! This is the worst pain ever...	Stupid sexy Flanders!
You missed all the fun.	Have you been in here all day?
I want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.	That oughta hold it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Don't go nuts.	I want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
Uh... better than that.	Whoa-whoa-whoa! Don't go nuts.
Perfect.	Uh... better than that.
We'll be fine, honey. The main thing is for you to get better.	I can't be in the hospital! Tomorrow is laundry day. And I've gotta de-meat Lisa's baloney.
Take that! Woo! Woo! H-Hey! Hey!	No they won't. We'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? Guys...?
Gotcha! Gotcha! / I'll show you!	Oh, really? Well, knock yourself out. Just don't expect any miracles from those two.
"And you're ""interferon"" with our good time!"	Good Lord! You're wasting thousands of dollars worth of Interferon.
'Mornin'...	Well I'll be. That cured my canker sores.
I don't know.	Dad, where are your clothes?
I guess, or one of her friends.	Don't tell me Mom dresses you.
"Come on, ""bikini inspector!"" ""Scrub toilet?"" Okay, that was a practice. Practice... Practice... Okay, here we go. ""Feed fish."""	Okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat.
Oh, it's a great hat. No one's questioning the hat.	You know, the reason for the hat...
Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!	Will you at least do the dishes?
C'mon, eat, you lazy fish.	Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!
Oh, but Lenny just got some bottle rockets.	Here are your lunches. And no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
Lisa, help!	You're dead, squealer.
I got the groceries!	No it's not!
It's the bread of astronauts.	Good. Maple soda?... A cell phone full of candy?... Astronaut bread?
Oh yeah. You were way off.	Dad, I gave you a list!
Hello, Lollipop Island? There's a little girl here who had too many sourballs.	Oh yeah. You were way off.
Marco!	Oh, couldn't be better.
Marco!	Polo!
Marc--	Polo!
Sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? He hit her again.	Will you guys turn that thing down?
Jesus?	Will this do?
What's wrong with us?!	Lisa, help!
You don't? 'Cause that's what I said! Tell her, Bart.	Ohh, I don't like the looks of this.
Yes...	Let's see... Crusty sores...
Yes! Yesssss!	... Horrible wailing...
Help us, Virtual Doc! Look at me! I'm on my knees!	Aahhh! Unclean! Unclean!
Leprosy? I can't believe it! That fortune cookie was right.	Excellent.
Mops? The cure sounds worse than the disease.	Now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. I'll get you a couple of mops.
Well, I think we're on the outs with Him, but I know someone who's even holier than Jesus.	Yeah, that sounds right.
Use your brains to help us. Your delicious brains.	Brains... Brains...
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You wonderful man!	Oh, those poor souls. What's the Christian thing to do?
Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd!	All right, food!
Here you go, lad.	Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd!
So you're shunning us.	Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers.
Oh, thank you good sir.	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you.
That it is. We'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married.	Whoa! This is a hospital?
Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.	Ah, you must be the Simpsons.
Really? The whole beach?	Oh, you'll have a great view of the whole beach... from the electric needle room.
Electric needle room?!	Yes, from the electric needle room.
I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.	Yeah, we know.
This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing.	No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.
Come on, loosen up. This is paradise.	Well, it all sounds lovely, but...
That's me!	Number one, report to the Dermabrasion Hut.
Aloha / Aloha Until we meet a-	That's me!
Bill, bill. Oooh! Llib! Eh-- Wait a minute. Bill?!	Aloha / Aloha Until we meet a-
Huh? Springfield University Homecoming! Finally, a chance to relive my golden college years...	Bill, bill. Oooh! Llib! Eh-- Wait a minute. Bill?!
"Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw? She used to call me ""Preppy."" Then she died."	Dad, you only took one course.
Then the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield A & M. I hate Springfield U. so much.	There's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party...
So much.	You went to Springfield U. You hate A & M.
My old dorm room. Come on, baby, let's matriculate.	So much.
My old roommates, the nerds. Ya workin'?	Or a ski hat if you've got a picture of a girl.
One million times...	Does anybody need that much porno?
... Yeah, so because of me, all the dorms now have security phones.	One million times...
Make me.	All right now, let's empty our pockets.
Okay. All right. Okay.	Professor Rocco, Chancellor Knuckles?
I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.	We look like slobs.
Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...	My computer has 512 shades of red.
Oh, this is gonna be so great.	Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...
So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this bucket of Super Glue is gonna drop right on his head...	Aw, they scrambled it.
He-- What the?!	So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this bucket of Super Glue is gonna drop right on his head...
Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!	Good evening, gentlemen.
Now who's the dean?	Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!
Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, there's no such thing.	I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
What guys? I wanna see the freaks.	Sorry, but these guys crack me up.
Easy... easy...	Okay. Hang on, Homer. Two eye holes coming up!
Too far.	Easy... easy...
What? I can see fine.	Homer, maybe I should drive.
That had nothing to do with the bucket.	What? I can see fine.
Cure me! Cure me!	Wow! Is there anything he can't do?
Yeah. And I got a bucket on my head!	Brother, I sense you are feeling trapped and desperate.
I see the light! It burns!	I have the power!
Uh, Miracle Boy?	Hallelujah!
I believe I had hair. Oh, here they are.	Uh, Miracle Boy?
I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. Do it for me.	"""Heat makes metal expand?"" Now who's talkin' mumbo-jumbo?"
Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...	What have you got so far?
Yeah, you're right.	That's nice, but maybe your Homecoming float should have something to do with college.
It's not to scale.	I think Godzilla's bigger than Superman.
And chili fries!	No, really. It can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles.
Can't make a float without flowers.	Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers.
Yeah.	Oh-ho, true enough. But, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?
Woo hoo! Go S.U.!	My thesaurus... You'll lose more than that. In preparation for the big game, Springfield Stadium has caught additional-seating-capacity fever.
Yeah, well you went to a cow college!	A & M is gonna kick your ivy-covered butts!
Okay, who needs another lamb rack?	Whoa Nelly, we have ourselves a barnburner here today! Welcome to the 117th dust-up between the Snortin' Swine of Springfield A & M and the Springfield University Nittany Tide. Ohhh, doctor! Break out the hickory switch!
Lisa? Ham hock? Tri tip?	Okay, who needs another lamb rack?
Well, I think the veal might have died of loneliness...	Do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
Oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, Marge?	Wow! He should have his foot insured by Lloyds of London!
I forgot my float!	Now, ladies and gentlemen, pour a little cider on those peepers, 'cause here comes the half-time parade!
Quick, pass me down!	I forgot my float!
Wait! Hang on!	And as those lumbering ships of the gridiron sail off into our memories, the players return to the field.
Wait! Wait! I got a float too! Listen up, 'cause I gotta explain a lot of it!	Then, what's this?
Boo?	Wait! Wait! I got a float too! Listen up, 'cause I gotta explain a lot of it!
Out of the way, Baryshnikov!	Hey, look out! / Look out!
Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit.	Just a simple yes or no.
No, wait! I got a kid who's a miracle worker! He'll heal him up real good.	I wagered a large sum on the performance of that scholar-athlete.
Or else what?	Well he'd better, or else!
Oh, right. The ice pick.	Or else what?
Bart, I need a miracle!	Oh, right. The ice pick.
Please, Bart. You've gotta use your powers! I'm beggin' ya!	Sorry, Dad. I can't just magically cure a broken leg.
Bart, do your thing!	I know, is phony major. Lubchenko learn nothing. Nothing!
Poor guy. He lost his leg.	Yes!
This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great.	Springfield Community!
Wha...?!	Hey hey!
Who are you?	Wha...?!
Everyone gets an award but me.	Seat filler.
Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?	I can't help it if I donated the most blood. Oh, I'm feeling kinda woozy.
I mean an award that's worth winning.	You won a Grammy.
What's that, sonny?	Homer, sit down.
Well, that was a great night for us all.	"""Thank you all so much. I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..."" I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over."
Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.	That's not an award, that's part of the set.
Look at me, I'm a billionaire!	Don't worry about a thing. We'll take good care of your house!
And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.	Good Lord! This bedroom is as big as our house!
Wasteful AND practical.	Seems a little wasteful.
A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge.	Wasteful AND practical.
Now I'm ready to hit the town.	A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge.
I'm drunk!	I'm Princess Margaret!
Look how loud I have to yell!	Mom! Bart's making faces at me. I think.
Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it.	Hmm, I know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?
Oops, forgot to swirl it.	Stop that! Cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like Bill Crosby and David Letterson.
Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits.	Homer, did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?
Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody.	Stop swirling, Homer!
And another thing: If I ev...	Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody.
Operator, get me Thailand. T...i... and so on.	And another thing: If I ev...
Everybody. I found Burnsie's address book. I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt, and then I called the Queen of England and asked her how it was going, and then I...	Homer, who are you calling?
Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?	Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill.
Hey!	Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?
Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.	Homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. You're not a billionaire.
Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party.	All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable. Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.
What about partays?	Party? No! No parties.
Damn!	No partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials...
And I looked so good on that box.	Damn!
Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer.	There's your problem.
Mmmm, Danish.	How 'bout Tuborg? The beer of Danish Kings.
Huh? If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doing here?	Now, you know I can't sell you no beer till two P.M., on accounta it's Sunday.
But I need that beer now.	When it gets to here, we can drink again.
What's that, a theme park?	Sorry. Two P.M. Or you can steal a boat and sail out to International Waters.
They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!	No, the ocean. Once you get twelve miles out, there's no laws at all. That's where they held the Tyson/Secretariat fight.
And you're invited.	They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!
Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I've gotta seize this opportunity. Just in case I never become a real billionaire.	Oh no, you don't! I'm not going to let you trash Mr. Burns' yacht.
Woo hoo!	Hey, there's another way to get on the boat!
Propellers... SPINNING! Turn... LEFT! Boat go... THERE!	Woo hoo!
Ships ahoy!	The boat's going sideways!
Well done, Mr. Lenny. Well done.	Ships ahoy!
We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot.	Ow!
That's right. See that ship over there?	Wow, you can do anything out here.
They're rebroadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! Or so the legend goes.	That's right. See that ship over there?
There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!	Please accept these illegal fireworks with my blessing. Yarrr.
Ow, ow! Oh, real mature, Lenny.	There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!
Who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!	C'mon, Bart. The Coast Guard is covering the Doobs!
Pirates! Are you friendly pirates?	Well, let's play it by ear.
What have you done with my party guests?	Uh, not really, no.
Third best for me.	What have you done with my party guests?
Help, pirates!	Aye aye, captain.
Oh, bless you!	Navy Seals are on the way.
Oh, that would be just... You're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?	How 'bout a tactical nuclear strike?
I don't wanna!	Enough! Get in the net.
You too.	Ah ha! Prepare to die!
Agh! Rope burns!	You too.
Oooh, oooh, Charlie horse, Charlie horse!	Agh! Rope burns!
Agh, my mouth!	Oooh, oooh, Charlie horse, Charlie horse!
Shut up, Net Face.	Some party, Homer.
I said shut up, Net Face!	Hey, you're in the net, too.
Ahhhh!	And now we will cut you loose. For liability purposes it is the ocean that will kill you, not us.
That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.	Hey, what do you know? It floats.
They're the greatest heroes of all. Hey, something's clawing at my leg. Okay, it stopped.	What about the people on the bottom?
Uh, Mr. Burns, pirates got your yacht.	... yes, not bad.
I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.	Ah, it's good to be home.
That's right. Just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... Oh, I can't even finish. I wanna be rich!	Bart, stop that! Now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here.
Like these guys. And look at all these rich people here. Not as rich as they should be of course. But still rich. All that big money. Look at all of these. Got all this money. I have lots of money. Oh look at all the other people. Oh, look at all the people who can buy and sell me. I should send a list of these names to the IRS. I'm takin' 'em all down. Oh, look at all the rich people. Oh, look at the rich...	That's right. Just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... Oh, I can't even finish. I wanna be rich!
Don't shush me, you rich bastards!	Shhh.
Vietnam Veteran.	What a fruit fly.
I.D.? Man, Charlie didn't ask for I.D. when I fought at La Choy and Chun King. I saw my best friend's head explode at Margaret Cho.	Do you have a military I.D.?
Why should I? Did my country give me a parade? No, man! They spat at me and...	Homer, give him the fifty cents.
Thanks. This closes the saddest chapter in American history.	Just go.
"It's B.T.O.! They're Canada's answer to E.L.P. Their big hit was ""T.C.B."" That's how we talked in the '70s. We didn't have a moment to spare."	Who are those pleasant old men?
Takin' Care of Business!	But first we'd like to dip into our new CD...
"No talking! No new crap! ""Takin' Care of Business!"" Now!"	Don't worry, sir. We'll get to that one...
"Get to the ""workin' overtime"" part!"	YOU GET UP EVERY MORNING / TO THE ALARM CLOCK's WARNING / TAKE THE EIGHT-FIFTEEN INTO THE CITY...
Work out!	Workin' overtime...
"Play ""Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!"""	Work out!
What-everrr!	We just did!
I stand by my disappointed groan.	Homer, Lisa's in that.
Look, Lisa. It glows. Oooo.	I can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
See, Marge? I told you they could deep-fry my shirt.	Zing!
Anybody care what this guy thinks?	Excuse me. But I believe this family already had a horse, and the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik-E-Mart with hilarious consequences.
Tunnel!	No!
But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws.	Oh, my. Ooh-hoo. It's going to cost us $500 a week to keep Duncan!
Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep.	At least you don't have to feed any of the stuff I bought at the fair. Well, except the mop.
Mmm, that's terrific, Duncan. You're ten for ten. Now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the NFL.	Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep.
Pearls, eh?	He's a diving horse. Maybe he could dive for pearls.
Huh?	Hey, Dad.
Racehorse, eh?	This horse is pretty fast. Maybe we can race him.
"Son, I learned everything I needed to know from ""The Horse Whisperer"". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife."	Dad, if we're gonna race Duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?
Ma'am.	"Son, I learned everything I needed to know from ""The Horse Whisperer"". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife."
Now for the actual horse whispering.	Ma'am.
When the race starts, run really fast!	Now for the actual horse whispering.
Champion horse, coming through!	Really? I thought I was the only one.
Good horse. Here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.	What the...
Hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?	Good horse. Here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
Hey, what's with the attitude? I just want some dealies.	You mean horseshoes?
He ran all the way here.	You really think that horse can run a mile and a half?
You can do it, Duncan. I don't care if your odds are... Five million to one!?	He ran all the way here.
That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come.	Don't worry, boy. I'll love you even if you don't win.
Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies.	Duncan's really fast, Dad. He was just intimidated by those other horses.
Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to...	Is that Duncan?
Possessions are fleeting.	Ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!
Woo hoo! In your little faces!	I mean shi...
Man, I got more trophies than Wayne Gretzky and the Pope combined.	Woo hoo! In your little faces!
I've been waiting all my life to hear that.	You're quite a trainer, Mr. Simpson. Care to join us for a beer in the Jockey's Lounge?
Hey, where'd you go?... Little man?	I've been waiting all my life to hear that.
What is this place?!	What happened?!
But you're respected athletes! You own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.	These are our real voices! We only talk like this on your surface world.
What do you want me to do?	YOUR RENEGADE HORSE IS MAKING US FROWN!
MY HORSE MUST LOSE?	YOUR HORSE MUST LOSE!
AND WHAT IF I REFUSE TO LOSE?	JUST LOSE THE STINKIN' RACE!
MY HORSE MUST LOSE!	We'll eat your brain.
Oh, it is, it is. But we've been pushing that poor horse too hard.	You want me to lose the Springfield Derby? But you always taught me that winning was everything.
Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, we'll give it a shot. I'll deal with those murderous trolls.	Maybe. But if Duncan wins the Derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud.
I mean, I'll deal with those murderous trolls.	Huh?
Go, son! Do it for the normals!	Might this be the start of a terrifying Planet of the Horses? In this announcer's opinion, almost certainly yes. And away I go.
I can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. And furthermore...	Go, son! Do it for the normals!
Hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-Gotta-go!	I can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. And furthermore...
Nah, we're cool.	Hey, need any help, Homer?
Marge, now!	Nah, we're cool.
Son, go get me a trash bag.	Marge, now!
Now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies.	We'll give you gold!
But what if I have to do my business?	Now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. Everything we pack in, we pack out.
How come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?	Use this plastic bag.
Bees!	Ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to Springfield.
Okay, nobody panic. There's plenty of spray for me.	They sound angry... and Africanized.
No they didn't. They just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit.	The Bird Sanctuary -- they ruined it!
Better do what he says, Marge.	Show us your boobs, show us your boobs.
We can hike anytime. This is our chance to see cars driving.	That's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned.
Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?	Hi-diddly-ho, pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes!
Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes.	C'mon! Somebody crash!
Oh, I missed one!	Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes.
Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!	Eight seconds! Great job, boys!
Oh, how rude of me. My name is...	We're going as fast as we can, ma -- Hey, who are you?
My bad.	Oh, how rude of me. My name is...
Finally!	And now, here's something for the guys...
That's a damn lie, and you know it! Gimme a shirt!	Well, I guess no one else wants a T-shirt!
Hey, T-shirt- T-shirt-T-shirt!	You heard him, girls.
Oooh, a bobby pin.	Fire!
And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Well, from now on I'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much I love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. Maybe just a pat on the butt. Yeah, that works.	No, I really mean it, though. I mean if it was you that died, I would have been on her so fast...
I know. No more being a jerk.	Now Homey, you know, Ned and the boys need us. And you know what that means.
Finally.	And now, the good people at Fan-Demonium, as part of a generous settlement, will fire a 21-T-shirt salute.
Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.	Now if there's anything, anything at all I can do to help out...
Then I insist on walking you home.	That's nice of you Homer, but I think I'll just go to bed.
Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part of the process. Watch the sprinkler.	Homer, this really isn't necessary...
It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. It's time to let go.	Hey, that's my sprinkler.
I know, I know. It's never easy.	I just bought that...
You want anything else? Water? Chili fries? How about some white noise?	I know, I know. It's never easy.
Sleep tight, Neddie.	Aw, Homer. You don't have to...
What the... Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?	Sleep tight, Neddie.
Okay, be right down.	No, Homer! I just need to talk.
"Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""I love you,"" or ""you're special."" You know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack."	"I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were ""No foot-longs."""
Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation...	If I'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here.
But, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game.	Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation...
Easy answer, eh?	Ah, you're right. I've just got to work through the grief. There's not gonna be an easy answer.
Oh, yeah. That's it, baby, that's the money shot. Yeah, the camera loves you. Oh-ho-ho, you tease, you.	Easy answer, eh?
You'll see...	Why are you taping Flanders, Dad?
I think it's pretty obvious that I don't.	Do you even have a job anymore?
Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of Flanders paying his bills...	Okay, I finished the gardening sequence.
Then we star-wipe to Flanders brushing his...	Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of Flanders paying his bills...
Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?	Dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes.
So, how're you doing, Ned?	I'm taking my name off this thing.
Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape...	Oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but I feel like I've turned a corner.
Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy.	Tape?
Single women of Springfield, your prayers have been Flanswered.	Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy.
Ned Flanswered, that is.	Single women of Springfield, your prayers have been Flanswered.
Shush.	Is this a dating video?
What would you say about a man who owns his own house...	Shush.
And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.	What would you say about a man who owns his own house...
A man who's not afraid to cry.	And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.
Hey, Ned.	A man who's not afraid to cry.
Yeah.	So that's why you maced me.
Ned does everything with class. Whether he's punching in his ATM code...or keeping clean in the shower...	Yeah.
But don't take my word for it. Listen to this testimonial.	Homer!
So if you're tired of dating the same old losers...	Oh I would date Ned in a second, if I was a woman, or gay. He looks like a cuddler, that Ned. I, I like that. I like to be held. I like to be pampered.
...Step up to the best. Ned Flanders, the man with the chest.	What are you doing, Homer?
Now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! The healing begins.	Ewwww.
Oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. Chicks really dig sensitivity. Did you get that, Bart?	Homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? It just feels way too soon.
Beautiful! And star-wipe, aaaand we're out.	Got it.
Hello? Mailman?	I'm just a Q without a U.
Oh, wake up, Ned. You think Maude isn't dating in heaven?	Homer, I'm having second thoughts. This feels so disloyal to Maude.
How could she not? The place is full of eligible bachelors -- John Wayne, Tupac Shakur, Sherlock Holmes...	You think she would?
He sure is!	Sherlock Holmes is a character.
So how'd you do tonight, Romeo?	"Ooo, Foofie doesn't like the sound of that ""maybe."" 'Cause him's a commitment dog. Isn't him?"
That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you.	You're darn right you are! And you've got lots of other great qualities, too.
Marge, we're trying to help Ned.	What floozies? What are you talking...
I toileth not on ye Sabbath, woman! A pox on thee.	Homer, you help too.
Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I've stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com.	You're watching PBS?!
It's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. If they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker.	"""Do Shut Up""?"
The Mother's the voice of reason.	Me eyes! / Oh, I'm scalded, I am!
Hey, what the hell's going on?!	Classic. Not hard to see why it's England's longest-running series. And today, we're showing all seven episodes.
You're mad? Where's my show!?	Sorry, but these thieves make me so damn mad! You know who you are. Thieves!
Finally.	"And now, it's time to go back to ""Do Shut Up."""
Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.	Outstanding.
Well, why didn't you say so?	"You know, I've worked with so many legendary actors over the years who could be counted on to ""phone it in"". Well, now it's your turn to phone it in -- your pledge, that is. Please, please, we're only ten thousand dollars away from returning to our show."
Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous.	Well, why didn't you say so?
Done and done.	Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous.
Eh, how're they gonna find me?	Dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars.
Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?	But, thanks to Insta-trace, we've learned it's Homer Simpson, of 742 Evergreen Terrace.
Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart.	Our pledge-enforcement van will be at his house in moments.
That's it, boy! Go get help!	Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart.
Umm... It's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary.	They don't show police chases, do they?
Will cash be okay?	Well said, Homer. And now, for the moment of generosity...
Well, then we've got a problem. The banks are closed by now.	Absolutely.
Maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in Springfield are simple folk. We like our cars fast, and our banks closed. Okay, fine, we'll go down there. But they're not going to be open.	It's 12:15.
Yeah, it's a real ghost town in there.	Maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in Springfield are simple folk. We like our cars fast, and our banks closed. Okay, fine, we'll go down there. But they're not going to be open.
I'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please.	Get in there.
I'll pay you later.	"""You are on television. Please play along."" Are you robbing me?"
Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just...	Um... Is there a problem, Mr. Simpson?
I can't do it. I can't kill a man!	Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just...
Mm-mm.	You don't have the money, do you Homer?
Mm-hmm.	And you thought you could stab your problems away?
The Hooligans!	Silly goose. Why didn't you say so? Get 'im, boys.
Sanctuary!	Bingo!
Sanctuary!	Sanctuary!
Quick! You've got to hide me from PBS! Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group!	Oh, why did I teach him that word?
Please help me! I'll do anything! I'll light a candle! I'll help with your next charity scam!	Ellmeaux knows where you live.
Sure, sure, Bob's your uncle. Let's just get outta here!	"The word is ""drive."""
Great, but why am I on a plane?	We'll send you someplace safe till the heat dies down.
South Pacific?! I didn't agree to...	Homer, how would you like to be a missionary in the South Pacific?
Oh, save me Jebus!	Sorry, no can do.
Jebus, where are you?! Homer to Jebus!	No, no. You can even keep in touch with him on this ham radio.
Hmm... This doesn't look so bad.	Jebus, where are you?! Homer to Jebus!
Aww. Hi there, little fella.	Hmm... This doesn't look so bad.
You're leaving? Wait, what do I do here?	You must be Homer! I'm Craig, that's Amy. Well, see ya.
Done.	First of all, forget everything you learned in missionary school.
Me Homer. Me hiding from PBS.	Don't let the bed bugs bite. Seriously.
Here you go. Knock yourself out.	Welcome, Reverend Homer. We look forward to learning about the Bible from you.
"Does the word ""jet-lag"" mean anything to you people? ""Jet-laggg""."	We can not read.
Oh, yes. Very much so.	Are you enjoying your ox testicle?
No, I'm good.	Really? You sure you wouldn't rather have a coconut? They're delicious.
Hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?	No, I'm good.
Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.	"Oh, we call that . Sorry, fish bone in my throat. We call that ""earthquake."""
Thanks, sweetheart. Have a Bible. My name's Homer. What's yours?	Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.
I'm gonna call you Lisa Junior. So, what do you do for fun around here?	I am Oovilu-eeoo-kitana-wanjay.
Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy. Why don't you just marry Craig and Amy?	Craig and Amy were also building a chapel.
So, how's the TV reception here? Excellent, or...?	I told you we should have asked them.
You don't have TV? But what will I watch while I'm sitting on the couch?	T...V?
No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer.	Cou-ouch?
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!	No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer.
Nothin'.	Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!
Here we go. Ee-yeah.	Nothin'.
Marge!	Hello? Is there anybody in there?
I guess so, but that first month was pretty rough.	Homer, are you all right?
Really? Without TV, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends.	You've only been gone two days.
Mmm, I can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: Bart, you're the man of the house. Lisa -- I'm promoting you to boy. Maggie's now the brainy girl. The toaster can fill in for Maggie. And Marge, you're a consultant.	I just don't think it's funny!
Yes, boy?	Dad?
Really? You're proud of me?	I just want to tell you how proud I am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
Oh, really? Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got some civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies...	Oh, yes. The whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. Ned Flanders is green with envy.
Well, I'm not not licking toads... Well, it's time to get to work. Humanitarian Homer Simpson, over and out.	Dad, are you licking toads?
Please, please, that's not necessary. I'm just God's messenger.	Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
And lo, what a wondrous message it is:	Please, please, that's not necessary. I'm just God's messenger.
"Like this, from the Book of P-salms: ""God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. That you may bathe your feet in blood."" As true today as it was when it was written."	And lo, what a wondrous message it is:
Now, let's open it up to some Q & A.	"Like this, from the Book of P-salms: ""God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. That you may bathe your feet in blood."" As true today as it was when it was written."
Yes, Lisa Junior?	Now, let's open it up to some Q & A.
Well, not the Unitarians. If that's the one true faith, I'll eat my hat.	Amy said there are lots of religions. Which is the right one?
Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock.	Um, if the Lord is all powerful, why does he care whether we worship him or not? Ak just saying...
Oh, who am I kidding? The truth is, I'm no missionary. I work in a nuclear power plant.	Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock.
Look, the point is, I want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. What you need's a little razzle dazzle. Qtoktok, are you thinking what I'm thinking?	Ooh, tell us all you know about nuclear power.
Hey, that's great. Now let's get to work!	I am Ak.
"Now, if ""The Flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."	Hey, that's great. Now let's get to work!
"Come on little friend, make a wisecrack. You know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."	"Now, if ""The Flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
Oopsie.	"Come on little friend, make a wisecrack. You know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."
A plane! Stop! Get me off this stinking rock!	Friends -- when I came here one month ago, this seemed like a strange and frightening place. But now I've learned to love this island as my second...
Anyhoo, I'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. Something that has revitalized cities from East St. Louis to Biloxi, Mississippi. The magic medicine of... casino gambling!	A plane! Stop! Get me off this stinking rock!
It could be you!	"""The Lucky Savage""?"
Check it out. There's Island Blackjack, Island Craps, Island Texas Hold 'em... But if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. Four sand dollars on number six, please.	It could be you!
So, how you doin'? Stayin' out of trouble?	Check it out. There's Island Blackjack, Island Craps, Island Texas Hold 'em... But if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. Four sand dollars on number six, please.
Woo hoo!	Number six.
So have fun everybody. And who knows? Maybe you'll hit the jackpot, get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical paradise.	Ooga booga.
Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels.	Homer, I'm so impressed. Everything you're doing sounds so rewarding.
Is everybody happyyyyy?	Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels.
Oh, my God.	Is everybody happyyyyy?
Oh, what happened?! I gave you a glittering Vegas, and you turned it into a skanky Atlantic City!	How can ace be one and eleven? Huh? What kind of God would allow that?
Because you're all terrible sinners.	Why are you building chapel?
Since I got here. Now either grab a stone or go to Hell.	Since when?
Well, I may not know much about God, but I have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for Him.	Since I got here. Now either grab a stone or go to Hell.
Not bad, Lisa Junior. But God's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want Him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume.	No, really.
Do you hear me, Lord?! Homer's doing your work! I'm the greatest missionary of all time! Of all time!	Not bad, Lisa Junior. But God's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want Him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume.
Oh, no! This looks like the end!	Do you hear me, Lord?! Homer's doing your work! I'm the greatest missionary of all time! Of all time!
Fire! Fire!	Wouldn't be the first time.
Fire!	Fire! Fire!
Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!	Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!
Good work, everyone. We're sure to be first in line for Duff Days.	Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!
I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.	You set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
Looking for these? Dee-dee-dee.	I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.
Twist off, dammit!	Now, which one of you is our designated driver?
Go Moe! Boo everyone else!	Okay, our first event qualifies for course credit at Dartmouth College -- trick pouring!
All right, guys. One, two, three.	Don't forget, today's winner will be immortalized on our new Duff Calendar.
"Moo?! Lenny, you were supposed to be ""E""."	All right, guys. One, two, three.
That one.	When I get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
Aw, Maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in.	Those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. And if Bart gets a wowwipop, I want a wowwipop.
Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture!	Oh, boy!
Oh, Moe. There's lots of people uglier than you. Like, you ever been to White Castle?	I can't believe they put those stickers over my face. I must be the ugliest man alive.
Caveman brow...	The little rat eyes...
C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight.	Or be with.
Well, it's time to get some closure. Extreme closure.	C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight.
Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee!	We're realistic.
Okay, now do Moe.	Beautiful.
"Yeah, but just for a minute. It's a funny story	 I'll tell you sometime."	Homer, did you hear that? She called me handsome. Me. It's like I've gone to heaven... Wait a minute. I died on the operating table, didn't I?
Oh, you dear, dear man. You're one of us beautiful people now. And your new life begins today.	So this is all real?
Yeah!	Yeah, hello yourself. I'm Moe Szyslak. Back in high school, I asked you to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance, and you turned me down. Well, I just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'.
Run!	Apology? Uh, geez, I wasn't expecting that... uh...
You're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.	Okay, last stop. Channel 6.
Whatever.	Homer, whoa, whoa, Homer. Change of plans.
Hey, Moe. Beer me!	Hey, there are women in our bar!
Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem.	Ah, I'm a little busy, Homer. Ah, you can pour it yourself.
You don't love me. The only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion.	I didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club.
That was amazing, Moe. I'm actually a little turned on.	I've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. But the one hole I've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.
I know what you mean. Our dog had that.	Yeah, hey, I gotta gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching. And I... the feeling is indescribable.
The one with the amulet?	Hmm. Looks like my character gets back together with that evil Contessa.
"What? Let me see that! ""Interior Coroner's Office. Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse. Coroner: 'Let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'"" Yep, that does sound kinda bad."	Precisely. Then I get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! They're killing off Dr. Tad Winslow!
Ding-dong!	Well, how could I say no to such a captivating...
Dr. Winslooooow...	Whoa, it's the door.
I am an angel from the future.	Why, who are you?
You're going to die in a skydiving accident.	And what do you have to tell us, oh, Angel of the Future?
Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. With sexy results.	How tragic. Tell me more.
Well, Sister Bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. With sexy results.	Ooh, that's unexpected. What else?
...and only then do we find out that Professor Gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over International Perfume and Wine.	Who cares? He's dishin' out the dirt.
Yeah!	Stickin' it to you for killin' off my character!
I'm sorry about your face, Moe.	What? What?
Yeah, you were...	Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters...
Let's see... Judging from the bug build-up, we're gettin' close.	How much farther to the campground?
What?	Folks, you're gonna want to turn around. The bugs are firmly in charge.
All right! Geez...	Please, just go! They've taken the Visitors' Center! They, they ate the comment book!
God bless Native America.	Hey, an Indian casino!
Let's go, Marge. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!	God bless Native America.
Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? Lisa?	Homer, you know I had a gambling problem.
Sure we can't talk you into it?	Ah, something troubles me about Indian gaming. On the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes...
Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian.	Yeah, but I really wanna...
HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA.	Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian.
Bleh. This virtual fudge tastes like crap.	Nonhover.
Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!	Yo, it's me.
Right, right, present. Anyway, can I get you some Soylent Green?	Don't you mean present?
Oh, here we go.	Isn't that made of people?
Oh, I'm tired of giving you money. Why can't you be more like Lisa?	Hey, Dad. My band finally got a break. I just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. How about a little loanski?
You should've thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.	But I want some.
I'm still cool.	What happened to you, man? You used to be cool.
Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. Oh, you can.	Nah, you've changed, man.
She knows what time dinner is.	Don't you think we should wait for Lisa? She is the President.
Then what is his ghost protecting?	Dad, that's just a myth. Lincoln didn't hide any gold in the White House.
I started what from a what?	Wait! How do you know this is where Lincoln buried the gold? You just started counting from an arbitrary place.
Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see...	Your plan makes no sense.
Oops, sorry, honey.	Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see...
Shut up.	Gold bars discovered by Homer?
Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!	Yeah, Crazy Talk came up with that. He got idea from Dances With Focus Groups.
Huh?	Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...	"""Dear Countryman: You have come in search of my gold, and I will not disappoint you."""
That lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!	"It's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..."" Well, isn't that clever? It's a metaphor."
"Ah, trash night. In France, they call it ""La Nuit Des Poubelles."" In Germany, it's ""Crappenfest."""	Eh, some government job.
Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice.	I can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.
See? A new pacifier for Maggie.	Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice.
Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.	He'll pay a lot to get this back.
Shh, quiet.	Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
Well, this muscle shirt's a pretty good find.	Shoo, nerds, shoo!
All I know is, I'm finally getting the support I need.	Dad, that's a sports bra.
Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza? I got-a no job.	Ooo, Italian.
Mama mia. Look what the Hawaiian restaurant threw out!	Gee, is that what I look like when I'm drunk?
Get outta my dreams and into my car.	Mama mia. Look what the Hawaiian restaurant threw out!
Hey Flanders? Can your God do that?	Behold, I am King Talkie-Tiki!
I'll be at Moe's.	Do not anger Talkie-Tiki! I am all-power--
I threw you a party at my house.	What are you, nuts?
"You wish. That's the stage we call ""Professor Barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. Here's drunk."	Mr. Gumbel, you're upsetting me.
Marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... Oh, it's just Barney.	Well, I'm off to market...
Disgracefully hilarious! You passed out before we could even give you your presents.	Oh, I'm a disgrace.
Wait a minute, Barney. You gotta be sober to fly. I mean, it's not like drivin' a car.	I'll show you. I'm gonna take these helicopter lessons.
Barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?	Santeria, you're the greatest!
You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer.	I know, but it's so hard. Please help me, Homer.
Ah, man that's sweet. Okay, let's go.	You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer.
Oh. My name is Homer and I'm planning a trip to St. Louis.	I feel for you, pally. But, uh, you want A.A. -- this is triple A.
Is there any other St. Louis?	East St. Louis?
Not a chance. I can sink way lower. I just came to help my friend Barney.	Ah, welcome back, Homer. I see you've finally hit rock bottom.
The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic?	Well, your recovery begins today. And we promise you all the sugar cookies and second-hand smoke you can handle.
I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.	They're on that table over there.
Hey? How did I get out here?	I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.
But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney?	Hey, Homer. Ah, no, no, no, don't sit there. Take this seat, right next to the tap.
Well, forget it, guys. I am not Barney!	Yeah, someone who makes our alcoholism seem less raging.
Okay...	See, Homer? It's not so bad. Now dance, rummy!
If I didn't, I'd lose their respect.	You danced for hours just because they told you to?
Can I, Marge? Can I?	Wanna go for a ride?
So you missed some big changes at Moe's. He hangs newspapers over the urinals now. You can read the sports page while you pee. Very la-di-da.	Yes, go! Just go!
Wasted? What about our staring contests? And the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? Remember the day we jumped that Census guy and stole his clicker?	Whoops, sorry. When I think about all the time I wasted at Moe's...
Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?	Those are all priceless memories, Homer, but I don't want to do that stuff anymore.
Take me home.	I didn't say that.
I'll scream.	Oh, don't be that way, Homer.
I don't wanna talk about it!	So how was your ride with Barney?
Stupid Barney, thinks he's too good for me.	I don't wanna talk about it!
But you've got me. Who have I got?	Cheer up, Homie. You don't need friends to be happy. I haven't had a friend in years.
Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends...	Well, you still have Lenny and Carl.
Oh, why can't I have a nickname?	Well, if Barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. Old friends stick together, like O.J. and A.C., or the Falcon and the Snowman.
"Hey, Apu. You got any of those potato chips that give you diarrhea? I need to do a little ""spring cleaning."""	Picture?
Barney.	Oh, hello Homer.
That's right.	Beer, huh?
That I will.	Enjoy.
You keep thinkin' that.	Then we agree.
Me too.	I will.
Good day, then is right.	Good day, then.
Ta-ta.	Ta.
Lenny, Carl, I know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. To me, you're true blue.	I said heads up.
Okay.	Now dance, rummy!
"Well, if it isn't Little Miss ""I'm not wasting my life anymore."" Which he is."	Hiya, Moe.
Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa!	Fire has broken out on Mount Springfield, trapping two youngsters and their camera.
Barney, you gotta fly us up there and save my kids!	"Well, I play Jerry ""Fireball"" Mudflap, a feisty Supreme Court Justice who's searching for his birth mother while competing in a cross-country fire truck race. It's garbage."
Barney...	I can't. I've never flown solo!
The call is from heroism. Will you accept the charges?	Barney...
Where are you going? The fire's that way!	The call is from heroism. Will you accept the charges?
Look out!	I know, I know! I haven't learned right turns yet.
Barney, no! Don't!	Beer. That's what I need.
No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!	Yes! I need it!
Ugh, it's warm.	No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!
Oh, yes I can!	You can't drink 'em all.
Gimme that!	Oh, yes I can!
I won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. I love you. Let's not lose touch after graduation.	Gimme that!
Stay away from my wife!	You brave man. You took six silver bullets for me.
Hi, kids!	Dad!
Get off! Get off!	Hang on! I'll throw you a ladder!
All right, I'm comin'.	Dad, help!
You can't prove I did it.	You did it, Dad!
I could do a lotta things if I had some money.	No, you saved our lives.
Yeah. So what do you call this stuff?	Well, I'm glad we're friends again.
It's not bad.	A double tall mocha latte.
...And three makes three.	Here's the mail, Dad. That'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery.
It'll be real soon enough.	This isn't real money. It's printed by the Montana Militia.
"Ooh, my first issue of ""Self-Test Monthly."" Finally I get to find out what makes me tick."	It'll be real soon enough.
Yeah, but in what ratio?	I'm betting it's hunger and rage.
Are you a good driver?	Yeah, but in what ratio?
"""Yes."" ""Are you a good lover?"" ""Yes."" Oh, I'm doin' great!"	Are you a good driver?
My way is easier.	Dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. You're supposed to open the magazine.
Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly.	Why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
"Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is 61. That makes you a ""Frigid Frieda."" I took off thirty points for all that crying you did."	Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly.
No way. When?	Well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away.
Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!	Six months ago. You were at the funeral. You fell into the grave.
"Okay. ""Last question: Who is your favorite Backstreet Boy?"""	Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!
According to this you're both idiots.	No, no, no, Nick. He's so good to his mother.
"Okay. ""There's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. Do you A) None of the below, B)..."""	Hey, thanks. What do we owe ya?
"Fine. I'll take the next quiz. ""How Long Will You Live?"""	Homie, for God's sakes, it's two a.m.
"""In an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat?"" Marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?"	"Fine. I'll take the next quiz. ""How Long Will You Live?"""
Okay, non-smoker... add eight years. So according to this I'll live to be... 42! Oh, that's horrible! I won't even live to see my children die!	I don't know. I'm trying to sleep.
I've only got three more years to live!	Now what's wrong?
See?! And these quizzes are never wrong, Marge. They're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business.	Well, maybe you added it wrong. Let me add it...
No!	Oh, honey, don't panic. If you just made a few lifestyle changes...
Can't sleep. Gonna die. Can't sleep. Gonna die.	No!
I'm not crazy. It's the TV that's crazy. Aren't you, TV?	Maybe you should see a doctor, Homie. A head doctor.
You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.	The crisis? Charlie Bluhdorn's birthday. The solution? A snappy banner. Out comes the phone, in flies Bobby Towne. And six drafts later, I had myself a party.
You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.	Well, we've got a Soloflex down at H.Q. Anyway, everything looks great, Mr. Burns. I can't find a single violation or employee acting strangely.
A mother can't die. And I'm a mother. See?	Of course not. He's just a harmless maniac, here to remind us of the precious gift of sanity. B... Oh, God! What's he doing?
Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.	You hate your father, don't you?
Why isn't my baby gaining weight?	I shouldn't have brought that up. I was just venting. Anyhoo, I think your fear of death is causing your insomnia, which is provoking your erratic behavior.
I see...	Because it's made of plastic.
Florida? But that's America's wang.	What you need is a good, long rest. I suggest Florida.
My pockets hurt.	Quiet, you two! You know your father's had a breakdown.
Well, enjoy your sightseeing. I promise I won't leave this bed.	Not now.
Uh, could you just uh... shut off the...	Sweet dreams.
Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!	Uh, could you just uh... shut off the...
Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!	Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
Now, this is living!	Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
Wooo! I like mu-sic!	We got Kid Rock comin' up for all you mosh monkeys.
Oh, no, it's a lost child! Don't worry, folks. I'll tackle him.	Yo, yo, straight out of Detroit, y'all, it's the J-O-E to the C! Let's rock the party with Kid Rock!
BAWITDABA / BANANA FANA / OOGA CHOCKA / ETC.	MY NAME IS KIIIIDDDD KID ROCK!
Bring on the rappin' granny!	Thank you! It's the pimp of the nation, Kid Rock, tearin' it up at Spring Break, y'all! Now, what we'd like to do next is bring it down for a minute.
What? She's hilarious.	Bring on the rappin' granny!
All for Homer... All for Homer...	But this ain't no forty-ounce curb. So, we're gonna need forty gallons, y'all!
"""Biatch?"" Moi?"	Yo, let's waste that biatch!
They called you a pig, Sheriff.	No, sir... Please don't tell Mama.
Guess how many boobs I saw today, Marge? Fifteen!	Oh, thank goodness. Where were you?
Doesn't he talk funny?	Nah, boys will be boys. I reckon he was just blowin' off a little steam.
My insomnia, it's gone! Check it out, Marge. I'm sane again! And I owe it all to... Spring Break!	Doesn't he talk funny?
Whoo! I'm an animal!	My insomnia, it's gone! Check it out, Marge. I'm sane again! And I owe it all to... Spring Break!
Hey, where is everybody?	Whoo! I'm an animal!
Fine. Be nerds. I'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.	The world looks to us -- the college students -- for leadership.
WE BUILT THIS CITY / THIS KICK-ASS CITY / WHAT KIND OF MUSIC BUILT THIS CITY?	Fine. Be nerds. I'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
LOOK OUT FOR WHAT?	Dad, look out!
THE GI-ANT...	THE GI-ANT GATOR!
You'll have to catch me first.	You killed Captain Jack! You in a heap o' trouble, son.
Look. This is our chance.	Well don't you worry, darlin'. I got some baby-cuffs in the station.
Let's go!	Look. This is our chance.
Well, I'm gonna try anyway.	You can't drive, Dad. He's got your license.
It worked! It's a miracle!	Well, I'm gonna try anyway.
There's no good place!	Pull over!
No shade!	There's lots of good places! What about over there?
Perfect.	No shade!
Or die trying...	Homer no. You'll kill us all.
The only thing we can do. Sit tight, and try to get some sleep.	Dad, what do we do?!
Rise and shine, everybody.	Hey, where is Dad?
Yeah, but first I talked to the engineer. He said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature.	You went to the snack car?
I love being married.	This family has hit a new low. We're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... And it's all your fault.
That's perfect! We can hide out here 'til the heat's off.	A diner!?
Woo hoo!	I like your honesty. You're hired. And you two haven't said a word. I like that. You're hired.
More hashbrowns, sugar?	No thanks.
But I was just...	Stop that.
...gonna try to...	Scat.
...knock you out...	Go on now.
JIMMY CRACK CORN AND I DON'T CARE / JIMMY CRACK CORN AND I'M NOT THERE / WE BUILT THIS CITY ON ROCK AND ROLLLLL / SOMETHING SOMETHING DAY.	Just quit.
You know, killing that gator was the best decision I ever made.	Too hot to bicker, I reckon.
Yep, this place is great. And someday, when Lisa and Bart get married, it'll all be theirs.	Got that right. / Durn tootin'. / Boy howdy.
Okay, but I ain't payin' for two weddin's.	You mean, when they marry other people.
You'd better.	You just relax. I'll have you in jail by supper time.
Your Honor, I'd like to represent myself. Drunken hicks of the jury...	Well, first up is the State of Florida vs. The Simpson Family.
Uhh... no.	You hear me?
Son of a--! And the gentleman? Damn it!	Champagne, madame?
Well, what am I supposed to do?	Simpson, we got a problem. The jazz pianist didn't show up.
That's what we've been trying to tell you.	Flavor's gone.
Fine. There are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.	Well, looks like you folks are free to go. But don't you set foot in the state of Florida again.
Arizona smells funny.	Well, we're still welcome in North Dakota and Arizona.
Poor Cyborganizer	"I can streamline any procedure, except this thing you call ""love."""
Talking while the TV's on can't be good for you.	Homer, sitting that close to the TV can't be good for you.
Nah. I want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.	You should get your eyes checked. I'm taking Bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
Too late.	I love you, Daddy.
Whee! Touch the sky, Maggie! Whee! Touch the sky!	We need something quick. My husband's eyes are really shot.
Who said that?	Dad, I've got Maggie.
Sorry.	Hey, wake up.
I... 8... P.P.	Now, read the first line.
Why you little...	I... 8... P.P.
Much better.	Better or worse?
Oo, my favorite Door.	That pair is popular with celebrities like Val Kilmer...
Ew. She ruined the Plastic Ono Band.	And Yoko Ono...
Would it get me out of having to choose glasses?	Maybe you're a candidate for laser eye surgery.
Less yappin', more zappin'.	Well yes, but I must warn you, it's an experimental procedure and we still don't know the long-term effects...
Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks.	Wait! You've gotta use these drops. They prevent your eyes from crusting over.
Yes, dear.	Now Homie, when we get to the liquor store, buy me some Jack Daniels and a carton of smokes.
"Hey, we got a postcard from Bart. ""Dear Mom and Homer. I'm having fun."" Aw, sounds like he's having fun."	Perfect.
Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn...	Why does it have a picture of Vitamin Barn?
Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes.	And you will be a dancer.
You're Daddy's precious dancing queen!	Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes.
Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?	And you look adorable.
Oh! What's that awful sound?	But I just... need more practice. See ya!
Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.	Where's Lisa?
Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!	There she is! Hi, honey! Wow, look at her go.
Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!	Stop clapping!
I didn't think, I just acted.	Oh, thanks, Dad.
"What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On."""	See, honey? All you needed was to believe in...
Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer...	I was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.
That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind.	Forget it, Dad. I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway Baby.
Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does.	Sure. It could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel.	Uh-oh. It's out of its matrix. Nobody move.
I'm down.	Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!	Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. Zig-Zag!?
I didn't hit your precious table.	No knife games on the kitchen table!
Oh, that's just superstition.	Dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!
In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy.	Becky, what have I done here? I'm so sorry.
Yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man.	Becky, I know you must feel awful. But at least this didn't happen after you were married.
Remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?	Bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?
CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DON'T WANNA BE AN OILY MAN /	It's settled. The stranger stays with us!
What are these things in the mashed potatoes?	Actually, that was Becky, too.
No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had.	Well, nobody's perfect. Let me just pick those out.
Oh, God.	No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had.
Take your time!	Be right back.
"Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say ""When's the ice cream gonna get here?"""	Awww. / Oh, no.
Run, Marge, run! Pump those crazy legs!	I'm not insane!
Don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. To finish off Becky. Then we'll have Mommy back.	Shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
I heard she mates with men, then eats them.	The kids are saying if you say Bloody Margie five times, she'll appear. But then she gouges your eyes out.
Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad.	Oh. Well, then, I guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. Except you cutting my brakes!
You monsters! You've killed her!	Mom!
Thank you.	Oh, I've got too much to do to take a nap right now. Lisa, get Maggie out of that cage. And Homer, since you're dressed for it, I got some S & M for ya: Scrubbing and Mopping.
Everybody wanted a piece of us.	But behind the chortles, this funny fivesome was trapped in a private hell.
Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV. That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV.	Nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. They almost drove me to fortified wine!
"Our favorite show was ""Hollywood Hogwash."" But we also loved ""The Dreck Squad""..."	I'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that Hollywood hogwash.
But we never saw people like us on TV.	"""Home Improvement""..."
"""My Funny Family,"" take one."	Using his home as the studio, and his family as the cast, this penniless Peckinpah shot a crude five-minute video.
Aannnd action!	"""My Funny Family,"" take one."
Honey, I'm home! The boss is coming to dinner and I need a clean shirt.	Aannnd action!
Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it.	I haven't done the laundry yet.
Not now. I'm busy turning on this washing machine.	Dad, that's too much deterge--
Mamma mia!	Simp-son!!! Where's my dinner?!
Every day I thought about firing Marge. You know, just to shake things up.	Okay, the material was a little corny, but Homer and I had real chemistry onscreen.
...M-E-R. Okay.	The Simpsons had their foot in the door. Fox ordered thirteen episodes. But would the public respond?
You're almost there.	R-U-P-E-R...
Good.	...-T.
Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.	The funniest stuff came right out of real life.
Why you little...!	"Dad, I've never said ""Cowabunga!"" in my life. Your script sucks."
And that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.	Hey, that's funny!
I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.	When we come back...
Hello, Mister Lobster.	By the end of their first season, the Simpsons were burning up Nielsen boxes in the U.S... and creating a sensation overseas...
Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.	The script originally called for me to jump the gorge. But I'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.
I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!	Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.
Right about here, I realize something's wrong.	I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!
Yep, there I go. Then came the rocks. Jagged rocks. Hitting me with their jags.	Right about here, I realize something's wrong.
Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!	Somehow, Homer became addicted to painkillers. It was the only way he could perform the bone-cracking physical comedy that made him a star.
Why did I take such punishment? Let's just say that fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.	Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!
Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there.	The tax men were merciless.
Ohhhh, Mister. Porky.	Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there.
Who told you about those laws? Was it Marge?	Dad, I want to go to bed. Aren't there child labor laws?
No, something that rocks. That's the sound of today.	Something that swings, with the beat of New Orleans.
Rocks!	Swings!
I'll kill you!	Sadly, this argument was not part of the act.
Hey, hey, stop it!	Oh, that's it!
Who are you! I'll get you!	GOT A BROTHER NAMED BILLY / AND MY TEETH LOOK SILLY / BREAK IT DOWN NOW!
That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. It gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. I returned to my first love, the legitimate theater.	After the state fair fiasco... none of the family were speaking to each other. Fox put the show on hiatus, and replaced it with hidden camera footage from the dressing room at Ann Taylor.
WHERE IS THE RENT? / I MUST HAVE THE RENT! / DOLLARS, DIMES AND NICKELS / I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!	Oh, that must be our new landlord, Mr. Stingeley.
I literally chewed the scenery.	WHERE IS THE RENT? / I MUST HAVE THE RENT! / DOLLARS, DIMES AND NICKELS / I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!
What?	That's ridiculous! How could I even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?
So, uh, how's everybody doing?	In that family, nobody trusted nobody. They even brought their lawyers to Thanksgiving dinner.
It was the best Thanksgiving ever. I mean, emotionally, it was terrible. But the turkey was so moist.	That's assault! That is assault.
Hi!	"Thank you, Taco, for that loving tribute to Falco. And now, to present the award for ""Most Violent Rap Group,"" Homer Simpson!"
What?! What's she doing here?	And Marge Simpson!
Yes, go on.	Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug!
We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the Sunday comic strip.	The Simpsons' bitter past was forgotten, and now the future looks brighter than ever for this northern Kentucky family.
Why you little...!	So you know it's great.
The Simpsons are going to Delaware!	I can't believe it. We won another contest!
This'll be the last season.	I wanna visit a screen door factory!
Hey, who cut out Beetle Bailey? I need my Miss Buxley fix.	I was so gay, but I couldn't tell anyone.
"Eh, too much baggage. Oo, my horoscope. Taurus: ""Today you will die."""	"Why don't you read ""Cathy""? She's hilarious."
"""... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker!"" Lenny?"	What?!
Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of...	"Maybe I'd better check mine. ""Today, your husband will die."" Homer, I'm scared."
Ow! Oooh! Paper cut, paper cut!	Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of...
Missed me! Stupid horoscope!	Ow! Oooh! Paper cut, paper cut!
Stupid horoscope!	Missed me! Stupid horoscope!
Cloopid blore-apope!	Stupid horoscope!
Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters.	Yeah, it's quite fetching, but, uh, aren't you worried about the deadliness?
That horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. What's for dessert?	Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters.
Fine.	No dessert until you eat your broccoli.
St. Peter! Woo hoo! Got to heaven before you, Flanders!	Sure is easy when they're stiff like this. And very sad.
Well, the thing about that is...	I wouldn't celebrate so soon, Mr. Simpson. I don't see a single good deed next to your name.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or good deeds.	Homer, settle down. I'll give you a chance to get into Heaven. You have twenty-four hours to go back and do one good deed.
Let's see, good deed...	Uh-oh. Uh... I'm pretty sure she was gonna be the next Hitler. Hello? Good deed done.
Bingo!	... Gotta find a good deed.
Woo hoo!	It's a miracle! Thank Heavens!
Did you see that? I did the deed! Open up!	Woo hoo!
Hey, I thought you guys could see everything.	Oh, I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking.
Well I'll be damned.	No, you're thinking of Santa Claus.
I am Hooomer Siiimpsonnn...	I'm afraid so, yes.
Oh no!	Silence, sinner! Prepare for an eternity of horrible pain!
Hello, Wife! Hello, children!	I just got over the plague.
Who's up for a merry jig?	Hello, Wife! Hello, children!
Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not merry.	Who's up for a merry jig?
I lost my job as an oaf today.	Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not merry.
Really?	Maybe you could be a dunce, Father.
Whaddaya think? Do you love it?	Hey!
Oh, I'm no dunce. I was born an oaf, and I'll die an oaf.	Whaddaya think? Do you love it?
Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.	But Husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?
So long, kids. Enjoy your new home! Say hi to your other brother and sister.	Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.
Boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty.	Oh, no!
Here's a better idea -- I know how we can replace those children.	Go back and get them!
Son? Daughter? I'm ever so sorry.	Here's a better idea -- I know how we can replace those children.
Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... It's all good.	Father, I knew you'd rescue us!
Mmmm, fish. Oh no, that's me!	Oh, that's all you got? Huh? Huh?
Almost. Just give her another twenty minutes.	Uh, hello, I'm George Cauldron. Is Suzanne ready yet?
Comin' up!	Speaking of which, how about seconds?
Anything to get out of work.	Yes, I will have fries with that.
Intelligent Italians? Something's wrong.	Gray, bottle-nosed, intelligent Italians.
Hmm. Phone's off the hook. Everything must be okay.	Those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. We've gotta warn Grampa.
It was her, all right. Take the one who wronged you.	That was you?!
Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!	I, I, I tuned out. Where we goin'?
Uh-oh.	Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!
Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!	Oh, no. You poor thing. Here...
C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!	If I could just... This is really not... You're hurting my...
Hey, you gotta hand it to those dolphins. They just wanted it more.	C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!
Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse.	No, there's a badger in there.
Milhouse? Milhouse?	Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse.
Get it.	Tons.
Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this.	No, Dad! We don't want to kill him! Let's call animal control.
What am I, a tailor?	How did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
Area code? But it's a local call.	Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please make sure you have the correct area code.
939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined.	The phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. Half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939.
Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.	Geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers.
Go away. We've got bigger problems now.	Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.
I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm gonna call the newspapers, the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody.	Go away. We've got bigger problems now.
Don't you miss the old 636, Carl?	I hate this new area code. Like I don't have enough to remember already.
What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.	I'm not sure which one's better. The 6 is closer to the 3, so you've got convenience there, but the 9 has less to do with Satan, which is a plus in this religious world of ours.
Not a single word of warning.	Don't forget the leaflets they dropped from the space shuttle. And the two weeks we all spent at Area Code Camp.
Joan Collins? That girl sleeps with everybody!	Oh, behave!
The Who? I love bands!	We're giving away tickets to next week's concert at Springfield's historic Yahoo Search Engine Arena.
That's my number!	... 0, 1, 1... aaannnd 3.
Hey, that's not me!	Ahoy hoy.
It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys.	Congratulations, you're gonna rendezvous with the Who!
Good idea.	You should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
How the hell did they find that out?	Why you little...
Uh, I have a question, Phoney.	... has been replaced by the convenience of two area codes.
Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question.	It's a movie, Dad.
Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you!	I like it.
And as usual, we Joe Twelve-Packs get the royal screw job.	I never!
Well, I've had it! You rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!	/ He's right. / We're gettin' it but good.
Well, I...	What are you pathetic slobs gonna do about it?
Nice wiring, Bart.	Well, I...
Okay, Plan B. Fellow 9-3-9'ers, I say we break off and form our own city!	It worked on the test-corpse.
Now who's stupid?	Viva la revolución!
There. We're officially a city. Now we just sit back and wait for an NFL franchise.	Now who's stupid?
Keep walkin'	Say, I couldn't help but overhear. I represent the Arizona Cardinals...
Mayor, eh?	Yeah, maybe you oughta be Mayor of New Springfield.
I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job.	The Mayor... Starring Homer Simpson.
New Springfield rocks!	Presenting our new plaque. I say the time for bitterness has passed. Let us extend to our brothers in New Springfield the olive branch of...
Oh yeah? What is it?	Go ahead and laugh! We have a better town bird!
Damnit!	The bluebird.
Read my lips: Yes.	More wheat cakes, Mr. Mayor?
No problem.	Dad, you got syrup on your sash.
Stop right there.	If you ask me...
Sweetie, you know your mother and I only stay together for the sake of my political career.	... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. It would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
Big grins!	That's not true.
That'll play great in the sticks.	Big grins!
Oh, that was fifty already?	That'll play great in the sticks.
Hey, the TV man is talking about us!	As expected, New Springfield's bold experiment in slob rule is a disaster.
Oh yeah? They think they're better than us, huh? Bart, c'mere a minute.	"Scientists say they are also less attractive physically. And while we speak in a well-educated manner, they tend to use lowbrow expressions, like ""oh yeah?"" and ""c'mere a minute."""
Oh yeah?	You c'mere a minute.
Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity.	Dad, I don't think this is such a good idea.
Woo hoo!	Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity.
Those rich, snobby Indians.	In retaliation for the power outage, Olde Springfield patriots have intercepted a beer truck bound for New Springfield and dumped all the beer in the river.
Woo hoo! Flood from water!	I don't know. Vengeance is pretty good.
You're right. We've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.	We can't go on fighting with Olde Springfield. These people are our neighbors. We see them every day.
Good idea. We should call the guys they used.	Like the one in Berlin?
It's ringing.	Homer...
And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction for building this amazing wall... From ninety percent recycled materials.	It's ringing.
Loyal citizens of New Springfield. You stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all.	'Bout what?
Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking.	Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!
Okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible...	Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking.
I can't believe all those rats fled my town.	Bye Homer.
Guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.	I can't believe all those rats fled my town.
I can't believe those traitors abandoned us. They couldn't take one lousy famine.	Well, Dad, you're mayor of a ghost town.
No problem.	Dad, you're bleeding.
Anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back...	No problem.
We've got the Who playing here tonight.	Anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back...
Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion.	Don't give up, Dad. Maybe we can get The Who to play here instead.
C'mon, Bart. We're gonna bring back The Who.	Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion.
Uh...	Can I help you?
Huh? Oh, right.	Dad, the chloroform!
I'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who.	Huh? Oh, right.
Wow, The Who!	Oh, yeah, right. I got fired by The Who. Whatever you say, pal. Wack-o...
Woo! Rock 'n' roll!	Wow, The Who!
Whatever. The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.	Yeah, we don't want to lose our pool privileges.
That's right.	The mayor of New Springfield?
That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City.	The crazy mayor of New Springfield?
"C'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of ""My Generation,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""Mama's Got a Squeeze Box""?"	Sacred bond.
But those Olde Springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like Keith Partridge.	We know our songs, Homer.
Somethin' wrong with your legs?	Just send a cab for us.
Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town.	We were expecting a bigger crowd.
Now these are the tunes I want you boys to play.	Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town.
"Oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""Pacman Fever / A do do do do / It's driving me crazy."" Look Lisa, Daddy's in the Who!"	"And we don't know ""Pacman Fever."""
So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts.	Give us back our concert, Simpson!
We'll talk.	Daily?
Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do...	All right, enough chit chat. Let's see how ya like flaming garbage!
Why me?	Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do...
"""Magic Bus""!"	Uh, says you.
"""Pinball Wizard""!"	"Okay, we'll play ""Magic Bus"" if you tear down this wall."
Well Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over.	Oh hell, I'll do it myself...
Yeah, we're heroes... But where's our parade?	Hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening our garden.
Eh, it's hopeless.	"All right. ""Open stuck drawer..."" All-righty."
Yeah, it's hopeless.	Or is it?
I said, it's... Ohhh...	I said, or is it?
Listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?	Homer, what are you doing?!
Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. Target date: January, 2007.	Ooo, baby.
Oop, wait a minute...	"And now, the grand finale... ""Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR."""
There.	Oop, wait a minute...
Fire in the hole!	There.
Hmm. It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.	Fire in the hole!
Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room.	What's going on here?
Oh Lisa, this must be a rough time for you. Do you have any friends or family you can stay with?	Oh, yeah? You didn't blow up Maggie's room.
Oh, come on. Tell us how we can make it up to you. Hey, pretend it's your birthday.	You've ruined all my stuff.
Anything at all. You name it. What do you want to do?	Well, the Book Festival starts today...
Stupid Lisa.	Anything at all. You name it. What do you want to do?
okay.	Mmmm.
Idiots.	Whaaa?!
Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about Krusty? Whoa, man! I mean, I knew he was a player, but geez, a kid?	Yay!
Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, how's Maude Flanders doin' up there? She playin' the field? Ooh... yeah, really? All those guys? Amen.	Homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip.
Okay, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey.	Catch, Dad, catch!
Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Except for some mag wheels. Oh, man, that would be sweet.	You know, Homer, I've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and I just realized I don't know the first thing about 'em.
Just a second, honey. Daddy's on his high horse.	Dad! Dad!
Yeah, I'm watching, honey. Nice cannonball. Anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'Cause over-thinking is... What were we talking about? Ooh, a clown.	Daaaad!
My uncle still has my nose.	"My little girl's sharp as a tack. I tried the ""got your nose"" bit on her -- didn't fool her for a second."
Can we make this hand high-low?	Fold-o-rama.
I fold.	No.
A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A-WEEM...	Oh yeah, right. Just let me go to my car.
Maybe so, but Dawson's gonna be bummed.	I'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering.
Marge, may I play devil's advocate for a moment?	Oh, Krusty. I'm sure she just needs time to get used to you.
C'mon! Get in there!	Sure, go ahead.
Stupid game! Now, what were we talking about?	C'mon! Get in there!
Oh, right. Why don't we just break into Fat Tony's compound and get it back?	My daughter's violin!
For a casual acquaintance like you? Absolutely.	Really? You'd help me take on the mob?
This is perfect! If I know Fat Tony, which I don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. Come on.	It's some kinda mafia summit! Every mob family in the country's here: the Cuomos, the Travoltas, the Lasordas, the Boy-ar-dees...
That violin's gotta be around here somewhere.	All right. / Come on, you're history.
I have a plan.	It's gonna take forever to go through all these!
Well, that didn't work.	I have a plan.
I think we're in the clear.	Then it's decided. Our website name will be crime dot org.
I said I was sorry.	That's him! That's the one! Homer Simpson!
Sorry you're such jerks! Ha, ha!	Oh, all right. / Fair enough. / He's a class act.
Ow! That Bullet went in.	Sorry you're such jerks! Ha, ha!
So, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?	Well, maybe I should.
I like your attitude. Take what you need.	I guess.
No, of course not.	Betty.
Take that, Lisa's beliefs.	Don't you call me a--
I knew this day would come. The cows are taking back what's theirs.	Oh, how cute! Kids, look who's on the roof!
Look, Marge! I'm in a limo! The Simpsons are going to Paris!	I can't believe how young he is. He'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
Ah, the Luftwaffe. The Washington Generals of the History Channel.	Bor-ing!
First comes love, then comes, um... Dammit, I know this.	Shut up!
Have a good time at your hippie club.	Oh, thank you, thank you!
No, I like to save the environment in my own way.	You're welcome to come, too.
Mmm... donuts.	No, I like to save the environment in my own way.
Sheesh, look at these refugees. How 'bout a smile?	And whoever does will have a place in my heart.
Well, moping won't make it better.	They've undergone terrible hardships.
Marge, she's gonna narc on our stash.	Mom, Dad, there's something I have to do. You're not gonna like it, but I really believe it's the right thing.
This is your fault, with your non-threatening Bobby Sherman-style good looks. No girl could resist your charms.	It's okay, Mom! I have a safety line!
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. I was lost in your eyes.	This was her choice, Mr. Simpson.
You call that saying grace?!	Awww.
Oh no, Lisa's gone! And nothing will bring her back. Unless...	Goodbye, Lisa. We'll miss you.
Oh, praise God, you're alive! Unless...	Dad, I'm not dead!
Oh, must hide Lisa...!	Homer, it's Neddy. I baked you a little something to ease the pain.
Come i-in!	Oh, must hide Lisa...!
Grieving father, comin' through...	Ah, yes. Ghastly business, that.
Thanks for the beer, Moe. But before Lisa died, she made this tape that I think you should hear.	Homer, ah, booze is on the house, seeing as how Lisa is, ah,... how do I put this... uh, ridin' the midnight train to slab city.
Read it!	Dear Moe, if anything should ever happen to me, I want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... Dad, I can't--
Oh, here we go.	I'm not dead! And neither is my sense of moral outrage.
Well, what do you want, a medal?	Just a cotton-pickin' minute. I've been getting A's since Gymboree.
Love you.	You gave Bart one.
No, really.	I just buckled down and studied.
Oh, how embarrassing. Well, let me just give you one of my many other valid...	Deadbeat. Deadbeat. Deadbeat.
Run!	Oh, how embarrassing. Well, let me just give you one of my many other valid...
Okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. What are you gonna do about it?	THEY'RE GETTING AWAY / STOP THEM, MARY-KAY!
Can we go now?	VA LA BAMBA / VA LA BAMBA...
Fine. You want passion? I'll give you passion.	No, no. Your playing, while technically proficient, lacks passion.
BLUE SPANISH EYES / TEARDROPS ARE FALLING FROM YOUR SPANISH EYES...	Fine. You want passion? I'll give you passion.
I think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.	When did this happen? When did we become the bottom rung of society?
I had to sell it for gas money.	Dad, what happened to the back seat?
Which I spent on a novelty horn.	I had to sell it for gas money.
Financial panther, eh?	Maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
Get him, Sheeba!	Mr. Simpson, you're a dollar overdrawn.
I'm on board.	Get him, Sheeba!
Just give the word, and I'll cut him off.	Well, I see you have several mortgages, credit card debt, no savings, and you're supporting your father?
Consider it done.	I couldn't ask you to do that.
Marge, your posture looks terrible.	Based on these figures, I'm afraid you'll need to declare bankruptcy... several times. Just look at this projection.
Yes, go on...	"Mr. Simpson, your intelligence profile indicates that you're too ""stupid"" to stick to a budget."
But how do I get it?	So let me put this simply: you need more money.
I'm just trying to work up the courage to ask Burns for a raise. Or a highly-paid internship. Something to solve my money woes.	Oh, I concur. Word-a-day calendar.
That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.	Hmmm. What is this? Some kind of force-field around these vegetables.
Mr. Burns... I was wondering if I could get a raise.	Everything's so green and alive!
Whopping?	What kind of a raise?
Well, sir... you see, sir... I've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well...	I see. You have thirty seconds to wow me.
A laugh? Okay, let's see, what's in the news today?...	I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!
At Lenny? But he's a war hero!	Oh, for the love of... Hurl this at that.
No!	Well, let's decorate him then.
Okay.	Not even for four dollars?
I liked when I threw the pudding.	That was capital - my lung is aching.
You're the boss.	Do it again! I'll make it an even eight.
Will you keep giving me money?	Let's keep the laughs coming, eh, Simpson? What say I make you my Executive In Charge Of Recreation -- No, no, better yet, my Prank Monkey.
Woo hoo!	I can't have my little monkey running around in rags.
"I'd like to buy a mint condition ""Spider-Man Number One,"" please."	Look at that Comic Book Fellow calmly eating candy like a Spaniard. Time for monkey to shine.
Uh, no thanks. I'll just eat it here.	Paper bag, or triple mylar?
Do I get paid now?	Oh, that was uproarious. First-rate job, monkey!
Little help?	Okay, now!
Little help, please? I made a boom-boom...	Little help?
Baby made a boom-boom.	The line in the lady's room is far too long and so I hope you don't mind if I...
Here you are, my good man. And while you're at it, throw in one of those polio shots.	There. That's six years' worth of inoculations.
Anti-polio.	Oh, yes, sir!
I've been doing some outside projects for Mr. Burns.	Homie, where did you get that ball of money?
Oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling...	Really? Like what?
Well, why do I have to do the Lindy Hop?	Look at their proud, hopeful faces. Wait'll they see that their rare Chinese panda is nothing but a fat guy in a suit.
Can't take the pain...	"Oh, she's saying ""I love you."""
Huh? Help! Mr. Burns!	Hey, there's our resident bull panda, Ping Ping. With any luck, folks, these two will become very, very close, if you know what I mean.
Am I glad to see you guys. You gotta call...	Hah. You ain't goin' nowhere, cutie.
Did you see Daddy dance? They all saw me dance.	Dad?? The panda was you?
Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.	So, this is your mysterious new job for Mr. Burns?
I know.	Oh Dad, you have to stop.
Maybe for you. How come you didn't rescue me?	Well done, Monkey! That other panda gave some unexpected zazz to the festivities, eh?
Well, you could treat me with a little respect.	Too busy trying to keep my sides from splitting -- it's happened before. Monty say, monkey do. What could be better?
You see, that's what I'm saying.	Oh, shut up, you tub of guts.
Shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey.	Not my Dad.
She's right. Yes, I may be naked and reeking of panda love, but I've got to stop this before it goes too far.	Dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?
I retract my statement.	Take that back for nine hundred and three dollars.
I mean, screw you!	Da-ad!
Huh? Oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?	A poor man.
Aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should I do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? I better throw it in the garbage.	Forget about him, Dad. I'm proud of you.
I see what you're saying -- I need to buy a gun.	Well, there's lots of needy kids out there...
You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.	No, Dad. You could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate.
Hey, what happened to...?	You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
Excuse me, sir.	Oh, good Lord, what a week!
I'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. Is this enough dirty, dirty money?	Yessss?
I'm just tryin' to dig myself out of a pit of shame.	Why, I don't think I've ever seen such generosity. You're a modern-day Kris Kringle, sir.
It's okay.	Say no more. I had a bit of a shoe-sniffing problem myself. I'm still not allowed on the third floor.
I don't need to rehearse. Ho, ho, ho, Merry... Line!	Wanna rehearse, Dad?
What? Lemme see that.	Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Everyone!	Then you'll love this next float! It's an all-gingerbread desk set!
What are you doing here? I told you I'm not your monkey anymore.	Prepare to be boarded!
The answer is no, Mr. Burns. Not for any amount of money.	They're good sports.
Oh, so much money...	Not for one million dollars?
But Santa can't be evil...	Oh, so much money...
But it's so much money.	But Santa can't be evil...
Not yet, honey.	Oh, Dad. You sold your soul.
Let's just say Lisa gave me an early Christmas present. The gift of dignity.	What's going on?
Hey, open up! I've been standing here all morning.	Baby made a boom-boom.
What's an e-mail?	Didn't you get the e-mail?
I don't have a computer.	Or a quiet phone call.
That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon as somebody lets me outta here!	Why not? Anything goes today.
Oh. I'm so stupid.	That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon as somebody lets me outta here!
Uh... I guess I'll take that one.	Oh. I'm so stupid.
Well, a paperweight would be nice, but what I really need is a computer. How about that one?	Hmmm, well, do you need a paperweight? Because if you buy that machine, that's all you're gonna have. Is an expensive paperweight.
Heavens, no!	Mm-hm. That technology is three months old. Only suckers buy out of date machines. You're not a sucker, are you, sir?
I just need something to receive e-mail.	Oh, good, because if you were I would have to ask you to leave the store.
I was an astronaut.	That's the same computer astronauts use to do their taxes.
Five thousand dollars!	Of course you were.
This is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?	You only have ten seconds to decide, sir.
Hey Lisa, check out my new computer!	You are on your fifth mortgage.
That's right! Top of the line!	Dad, you shouldn't drag that around.
Stupid pothole. Don't worry, head. The computer will do our thinking now.	That's right! Top of the line!
Oh, yeah... perfect. Now then...	Stupid pothole. Don't worry, head. The computer will do our thinking now.
Computer... kill Flanders.	Oh, yeah... perfect. Now then...
Good start! Now finish the job!	Did I hear my name? My ears are burnin'.
$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.	Ah, you're busy. Catch you later, compu-tater.
You're it!	Dad, I'll set up your computer. Why don't you and Bart go play in the back yard?
Hmmmmm.	Okay, you're ready to go. I've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them.
Fine!	Homer, bring that back in the house.
Ooh, a dancing Jesus. De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. If there's a better use for the Internet, I haven't found it.	Fine!
Hey!	You have chosen no, meaning you've committed a crime, but don't want to confess. A paddy wagon is now speeding to your home.
Here it is, everybody! The world's greatest website!	You have the right to remain fabulous!
You'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not.	Here it is, everybody! The world's greatest website!
No kiddin'. What do you think of my page, Lisa? Be honest. It's great, isn't it? Go ahead and say it's great if you want to.	I got suspended from school today.
They can't sue me if they don't know who I am. I'll just call myself Mr. X.	I took a swing at a cop.
Yep, you can't go wrong with Mr. X.	I'm just mad all the time.
I can't. My web page hasn't gotten a single hit.	Mom wants you to come to bed.
Come on.	I can't. My web page hasn't gotten a single hit.
That lousy pothole! Why don't they fix it?	You have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea...
Get out! Who told you that?	I heard Mayor Quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
Hmm, that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web page.	Nelson.
Nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. Nelson is gold.	You can't post that on the Internet. You don't even know if it's true.
Beautiful. We have confirmation.	You know, it might've been Jimbo.
I did it. I changed the world. Now I know exactly how God feels.	Good Lord! We've discovered the ruins of an ancient city! Okay, you do better.
Bring me two of every animal.	Do you want turkey sausage or ham?
Darn tootin'.	A new Internet watchdog is creating a stir in Springfield. Mr. X, if that is his real name, has come up with a sensational scoop.
No way! Mr. X is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!	I'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. Maybe you should quit while you're ahead.
What a bombshell!	Eh, who am I to point the finger? I once ran over a guy in a parking lot, and dumped the body on a golf course.
Oh, I don't know, Carl. He might be closer than you think.	The public should be warned. I wish Mr. X were here.
No!	Are you him? Are you Mr. X?
I am not. Or am I?	Uh, but you talked in that real sly voice. Hey, hey, everybody, Homer's Mr. X!
No!	Are you?
Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?	Well, if Mr. X were here right now, I'd buy him a tall frosty.
Not even a little one?	No.
What if I just whisper it?	No.
I love spying.	Oh, pshaw.
And who's selling the uranium to the terrorists? Montgomery Burns. Now, we wait.	This place is falling apart.
Whoa... He's in trouble.	Let go of me! I'm innocent!
Nooo!	Unfortunately, we don't know who he is. So his cash award will be used to feed starving children.
I'm Mr. X! Gimme! Gimme!	Nooo!
Thank you, folks. And now I'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and...	He is Mr. X! Hah!
I bit my tongue!	Thank you, folks. And now I'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and...
Finally.	I'm proud that you won the Pulitzer...
They're with God now.	But I do feel bad about the starving children...
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?	Oh, well, that's good... Oh.
Oh, don't worry about the Mr. X thing. I'm just here for a beer.	Hey, guys. How's it goin'?
I smell another Pulitzer.	So hungry.
Nobody's visiting my web page anymore. My counter is actually going down.	I'll tell you later.
That's a great idea! I'll make up some news!	Well, you can't post news if you don't have any.
"Let's see now... ""BULLETIN: New Race Discovered Living Six Inches Under... Denver."""	At least take off your Pulitzer Prize when you say that.
All Named 'Morton'... or... 'Mortonson'...	Oh, Dad...
Real news is great, son. But I'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-A bull plop.	Hey, Mr. X! I got a tip for ya. In science class, they're dissecting frozen hoboes. And I have the bindles to prove it.
Gimme a hundred Lotto tickets, Apu. Because Mr. X is on a roll.	Real news is great, son. But I'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-A bull plop.
Stop it, Apu. You're scaring me.	Gimme a hundred Lotto tickets, Apu. Because Mr. X is on a roll.
What's going on?	Stop it, Apu. You're scaring me.
Help, I'm being kidnapped!	What's going on?
Save me, Mr. X! Wait, I'm Mr. X.	This is not a library.
Wuzzah?	Save me, Mr. X! Wait, I'm Mr. X.
What the hell?	Wuzzah?
How did I get here? What is this place?	What the hell?
How do I get outta here?	This is... The Island.
So I'm a prisoner? How come?	Oh, no one leaves The Island.
But I don't know anything. At least I don't think I do.	Because you know something.
No you won't!	See you tomorrow.
Hello, operator? I'd like to report a really weird island. Please send lots of rescue copters to...	No you won't!
All right, whatever.	Hello, operator? I'd like to report a really weird island. Please send lots of rescue copters to...
I am not a number, I am a man. And don't you ever... Oh, wait, I'm Number 5. Ha ha! In your face, Number 6!	I'm Number 15. What number are you?
Who are all these oddballs?	Yes, well done.
Wow.	Well, they keep us here because we know too much. Number 27 there knows how to turn water into gasoline. Number 12 knows the deadly secret behind Tic-Tacs. And I invented the bottomless peanut bag.
So, who brought us here?	Wow.
Did you bring us here?	I don't know.
Oh, they drugged the tea. They knew my one weakness.	Uh, the shoes are part of the uniform.
Who are you and why are you holding me here? I want answers now or I want them eventually.	Hello, Number 5. How's every little thing?
Sorry.	Ow. Please. Don't do that.
That's impossible. All my stories are bull plop. Bull plop!	I'll be blunt. Your web page has stumbled upon our secret plan.
But why?	Oh don't be cute. I'm referring to the flu shot exposé. You see, we're the ones loading them with mind-controlling additives.
Of course! It's so simple... Wait, no it's not. It's needlessly complicated.	To drive people into a frenzy of shopping. That's why flu shots are given just before Christmas.
No, sir.	Yes it is. And we can't have you out there mucking it up now, can we?
Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse.	There's a good boy. Let's get you some ice cream. There you are.
I'm sorry. What?	I wouldn't count on that, Number 5. As far as your family knows, Homer Simpson is walking in the front door right about now.
I'm tired of being drugged and gagged. There's gotta be a way to escaped.	I am a new tie wearing.
Huh?	Psst.
Oh, no! An anti-escape orb!	That's the third time that's happened.
Huh, that was easy.	Oh, no! An anti-escape orb!
What a horrible four months. Now to warn everybody.	Shut up! That's why!
Attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...	What a horrible four months. Now to warn everybody.
Hey!	Attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
Huh?	Sorry, old chap. But you're proving quite the caterpillar in our buttermilk.
Not a chance. No one can silence me, but me!	We're shutting you down.
Whuh?	That arranged can be.
If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch.	Yes, fight and struggle!
Oh, Marge. It's me, the real Homer!	If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch.
Absolutely.	Can I turn this off?
The dog thinks so...	The dog thinks so, too.
Bad dog.	The dog thinks so...
Oh, it's wonderful.	Once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place.
Truly God's country.	Oh, it's wonderful.
See you on the island.	Truly God's country.
Okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding.	Welcome to the Magic Palace.
Wait a minute...	Okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding.
Beer! Yes! How did you know?	I'm receiving a drink order... Something foamy... Is it a beeee...?
He's very good.	Don't worry, Marge. You won't feel a thing. You'll feel four things.
Gee, I wish I could, son, but we've already left the gift shop.	"""Ages 8 to 80."" Hmm... That's me! Dad, will you get me this magic kit?"
I know that. How much to fix it?	Hmmm. Well, there's your problem.
I can't afford that.	Ooh, well, ah, that's a foreign fish we're lookin' at... So, uh, sixty-five hundred. Plus three-fifty.
He couldn't breathe.	Maybe I can make some money, Dad. My magic act is really coming along.
Step right up! See the magic boy! Witness mystifying feats that will leave you scratching your head until it's raw and bloody!	He couldn't breathe.
Come on, pony up, Flanders. The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'.	Oh, my goodness!
Black arts?!	Oh, no! I could never support the black arts.
Okay, we'll move. We don't want any trouble, fellas.	Hey, you guys... You're in our spot!
I know, but which one?	Dad, only one of them is real.
Sixty cents?! I would've made more if I'd gone into work today!	I know, but which one?
A good son would come through for his dad!	Hey, don't blame me. I gotta compete with TV, and the Internet.
I told you! I find them boring.	Yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's Little League games!
Oh, that's it! You can walk home!	Well, I showed up for all your stupid interventions.
Stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car.	Come on, brothers. Dig deep.
What the?!	Hey, Homer! Check it out!
Is that a steak?	What the?!
Who gave you all this money?	Yeah, I know a little place.
Really. Hey, maybe we could do that again. Can you look even more pathetic?	People. I guess they thought I was a charity case.
Oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! We could make a fortune.	Really. Hey, maybe we could do that again. Can you look even more pathetic?
Well, yeah. But God conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs.	But wouldn't that make us con artists?
There ya go! We'd be stealing from people we know. It's just like the seasons.	So in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe.
I think you know the answer to that.	Sounds good. Wanna eat my fat?
They have any father-and-son grifts?	"This book has all the classic cons. There's ""The Pigeon Drop,"" ""The Ear Wigger,"" ""The Brillstein Grab..."""
Interesting.	"Well, there's the ""Albany Ham Scam."""
I could ask you the very same question.	What are you doing? Why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
Would you?	Should I just back out of the room?
You bet. Let's trim the mark.	Okay, Dad. Ready for our first con?
Ten-four, Kemosabe.	Nice use of the lingo, Homer.
What have you done, you clumsy little ox?! That cake was for your deaf sister!	A storm is coming!
No, no. Don't protect him. You'll work off that cake in the acid mines.	Sir, it was my fault.
Well, you're the mark.	No, no, no. I'll pay for the cake.
... of integrity.	Well, you're the mark.
A singing rubber fish, of course.	Wow, look at all this loot! What should we buy first?
What in the hell are you talking about?	There you are. How was the magic act?
Oh, right, the magic. The magic was great. It's really... the way to go.	What in the hell are you talking about?
Suckers.	Or so it would seem...
Dog for sale!	I just gotta get him back!... Or if not him, a similar dog...
Dog for sale!	Dog for sale!
Oh, he's not for sale.	How much for the dog?
Here's for the repairs, and a little extra for you.	Although if the right offer came along...
Yes, son?	Dad?
In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.	Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for. Doesn't that balance out the universe?
Hello, is the lady of the house in?	Okay, I'm sold.
Oh, of course, of course. It's just that...	Oh, no, Homer, remember? Maudie got called up to Heaven.
Well, before she died, she ordered this Bible especially for you.	What?
Now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man...	Why, there's my name in gold.
We'll be safe here.	Run, Dad!
Dad?	Amateurs!
How'd you get wise to us?	That's right.
So what's the pitch, old man?	Yeah, in the Depression, you had to grift. Either that, or work.
Oh... my... God.	Team up with me, boys, and we'll go for the biggest honey pot of 'em all.
Let's dust a few fossils.	Oh, why not? If we don't take their money, they'll just give it to some televangelist.
Which one of you youngsters is Abe Simpson?	"Now, this scam was in ""The Sting Part II,"" so nobody knows about it."
You've just won 10 million dollars from that Publisher's Cleary-dealie!	I'm Abe Simpson.
He's dead.	Yeah, I'm gonna get me the craziest, strippiest...
I guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. Too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.	Oh, this is terrible. Now who do we give the money to?
You're right. We'd better just take this check back for shredding.	Forget it, Ed. Do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? Why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head.
Thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... Is that everyone?	No, wait! We've got a hundred bucks each! Hang on!
What's your problem, Sport? Afraid to be rich?	Thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... Is that everyone?
So we're under arrest for fraud?	Call me mint jelly, 'cause I'm on the lam!
Thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting.	Well, this is about the flashiest car I've ever impounded.
Yeah. We're not criminals. We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids.	Please, FBI man, don't throw us in jail. We just made one mistake.
You'd do that for us?	Hmm... Okay, tell you what. I'll let you turn yourselves in. Maybe they'll go easier on you.
Okay, thank you, sir.	Well, I did ruin the boy's birthday cake. Go on in. But I'll be watching.
Don't worry, son. I have an idea.	Okay, thank you, sir.
Chief, I'd like to scare my son straight. Could I show him a jail cell?	Don't worry, son. I have an idea.
Yeah. Ya big idiot...	Okay, we're all locked up now...
Colgate Cavity Patrol?	That's not an FBI badge.
Yeah, he conned us good. Well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place.	That guy was a grifter!
What?	Yeah, he conned us good. Well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place.
Lies got us into this mess, son. From now on it's honesty all the way.	It's ten in the morning!
Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?	You were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
Well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some...	What did he look like?
Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly.	Anything else?
Anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. Let's hit the hay.	Oh, dear. We don't want that.
Huh? But that's impossible.	Homie! Homie, wake up! They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!
Uh-oh.	I didna do it, I tell ya.
Well, look at that. But who called the police?	What do you care, loner?
'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now, let's all hit the hay.	Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!
I guess you haven't heard of chloroform.	'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now, let's all hit the hay.
Let's see how this plays out.	Dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth.
I told you, my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!	Mr. Simpson, could you describe your assailant to the court?
When the time is right...	Dad! Tell them!
Let's see where he's going with this...	Daa-ad!
Stop! This has gone on just long enough.	Willie! As your employer, I insist that you...
Nobody carjacked me. I tried to pull a con and got conned myself. And then I lied to you all! So did Bart.	Stop! This has gone on just long enough.
But Skinner got shot!	Wait a minute. This whole thing was a set-up?!
But what about the guy who took my car?	Yeah, we hornswoggled you good.
I can't believe everyone was in on it.	"He's doing ""Dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
Wait a minute. You're telling me the police force, the TV news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and Bart a lesson?	Willie wasn't!
Heh, heh, heh. Tremendous.	Well, I'm gonna take the Broncos in this game. 'Cause the Packers will be blinded by Jerry's tie.
Lenny, are you watching this?	Well, folks, he's got a point. Uh, with all our unscripted horseplay, we sometimes don't think about...
I know!	Yeah, they really hurt that guy's feelings.
Circus?	Ready for the circus, Homer?
But I wanna watch Bret Favre!	The Cirque de Purée. We've had tickets since Septembre.
Oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement.	Finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder.
I wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.	As French Canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment.
Just smash it open!	But I cannot help you. I am just a local merchant from, uh... this town.
Oh no you don't! I paid full price for this freak show. Now nourish the child within me! Nourish...	Mesdames et messieurs, it appears the Cloud Goddess is ripe with rain babies. We must run for our trucks.
One snow angel, comin' up.	Lenny says we've got the day off! Yippee!
Ahh, why does that always happen?	One snow angel, comin' up.
I 'unno... Internet?	This is terrible. How will the kids get home?
My car, your roof. It's only fair.	Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof.
Well, yeah.	But it's my car.
I think I know my own life, Ned.	"Sure you did -- ""Mr. Plow."" You're wearin' the jacket right now!"
CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS / MR. PLOW.	I think I know my own life, Ned.
I hope it's Flanders. I'm just kidding. Hey, you're all right.	Oh! I think we hit something.
Yeah, as a tribute to Princess Di. And Dodi. Because these days, princesses...	Catchy song, all right. You really wrote it?
Wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles.	Well, better turn off that engine. Before those fumes put us in tombs.
Marvelous! Marvelous! Enough! I grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.	I know. That's why the position's available.
Bring me my ranch-dressing hose.	Marvelous! Marvelous! Enough! I grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
I know, ranch dressing.	Homer! Wake up! The car's filling with...
A hamster ball!	I know, ranch dressing.
We're free! And we've got something to eat.	Just like the one that saved Ezekiel!
Woo hoo!	We're free! And we've got something to eat.
You're the camel.	Now let's go save those kids.
Hey, this car's got cruise control.	You're the camel.
School, please.	Hey, this car's got cruise control.
Do you have airbags?	We're gonna crash!
C'mon, kids. Let's leave this awful place and never come back.	Gotcha!
Whuh?	And the exhaust pipe is leaking.
Oh, baby!	Ignore her, Effendi. We have each other.
Animation is so great. It's way better than... whatever the alternative is.	Merry Christmas from the Simpsons!
Pick me! Pick me!	Folks, you're about to witness the exciting new process of motion-capture animation.
I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT / SHORT AND STOUT / HERE IS MY HANDLE / HERE IS MY SPOUT.	Now, when we activate the suite, our furry friend will copy you exactly.
See? Now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?	That motion-capture suit is just what this country needs. Just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured. Like this...
You're right. That suit gizmo could be worth billions. And I'm gonna get a piece of the action!	That would be the world's funniest marsupial.
I'd like to withdraw my life savings, please. And hurry!	So, does he still work here or what?
Oh. Yes, of course. Uh, she's behind that plant.	Uh, Sir, this is a joint account. Uh, you'll, need your wife's signature, too.
Hello, Marge. Hi, Homie. Sign this, please? You're the boss! Daddy, ask the man for some candy! No, no, no candy for you. Then at least get some candy for yourself.	Oh. Yes, of course. Uh, she's behind that plant.
Kids.	Hello, Marge. Hi, Homie. Sign this, please? You're the boss! Daddy, ask the man for some candy! No, no, no candy for you. Then at least get some candy for yourself.
So long, sucker!	Here's your candy.
Uh Yes, I see that it's in bill form. Excellent.	Uh, sir? Your life savings.
"I'd like to buy 500 shares of ""ANIMOTION, INCORPORATED."""	Uh Yes, I see that it's in bill form. Excellent.
Absolutely.	Okay... Uh, now, before I execute this order, are you sure you understand the risks of stock ownership?
Animotion.	For automated stock prices, please state the company name.
Yahoo!	Animotion. Up one and one-half.
Huh? What is this crap?	Yahoo. Up six and a quarter.
Sleep tight, my beloved. You're my ticket out of this hellhole.	Fox Broadcasting. Down eight.
Sorry. Our ticket out of this hellhole.	Homer!
Yes!	Turning to the stock market, Animotion is up an eighth...
"Oh, I hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""	... after plunging seventy-five points this morning.
Okay people, let's keep this short. We all want to get home to our families.	Family meeting! Family meeting!
Point of order: I didn't lose all the money. There was enough left for this cowbell.	Burn! Burn! Burn!
Damn you, e-Bay!	Point of order: I didn't lose all the money. There was enough left for this cowbell.
I have a great way to solve our money woes: you rent your womb to a rich, childless couple. If you agree, signify by getting indignant.	Damn you, e-Bay!
C'mon, Marge. We're a team! It's uter-us, not uter-you.	Are you crazy?! I'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
You mean, like, medical testing?	You know, Homer, I got a great way to make money -- I'm a human guinea pig.
Yeah, but aren't those experiments dangerous?	Oh, oh, right, okay.
Hmmmm.	Ow! Not so loud.
It burns! It burns!	First, we'll test this experimental perfume on you.
Food? I'm BLIND!	Homer, you really have no desire to eat that food?
Dammit!	He must've brought it in with him.
There's a crayon in my brain?!	Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you have a crayon lodged in your brain.
But I've had thousands of head x-rays. How come no one ever noticed it before?	There's a crayon in my brain?!
Well, I'm not sure, but it mighta happened when I was six.	Do you have any idea how this might have happened?
Hey, I came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted.	Mr. Simpson, this could be responsible for your subnormal intelligence.
Hmmm. Increase my killing power, eh? Let's do it.	We could remove the crayon for you. It could vastly increase your brain power... or it could possibly kill you.
I just underwent a procedure to increase my IQ fifty points.	Oh, Homer, where have you been?
And they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too.	Really?
Is the capital of North Dakota Bismarck?	Do you feel smarter?
Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect.	I don't believe it. Say something else smart.
It's a date!	I'd love to go to the library with you.
Everything from Hop on Pop to Death Be Not Proud. It's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop.	Dad, did you read all these books today?
Get out!	I always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
Better. I was working on a flat tax proposal, and I accidentally proved there's no God.	Oooh, found a new short cut?
I am here to give hope to the least of you. Because we all have a crayon up our nose. Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. Maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...	"Welcome to the third lecture in our series on ""Not Putting Things Up Your Nose."" Please welcome Homer Simpson."
Yes, Nelson?	Question!
Not being a moron, I wouldn't know. However, .	A moron says what?
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your moron!	Wake up, Homer.
You see? It's cool to be smart.	Haw haw!
So be like me, and use your minds: paint a painting, sing a song, and dance a dance!	You see? It's cool to be smart.
I've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.	Whatcha mailin', Homer?
I've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.	How come you're not giving it to Mr. Burns?
Comfy, isn't it?	Yeah, it's nice to have someone with brains in this nuclear plant. Homer's the guy who rigged up my pants with this special codpiece.
Wait, you can't hate me. I'm your better! Your better!	I can't feed my family with a codpiece.
Effigy, eh? Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. Hey, that's me!	Burn! Burn! Burn!
Stop that! The fire inspector would be appalled.	Effigy, eh? Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. Hey, that's me!
So you all hate me?	Don't tell me how to feel.
Hmm, I'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern...	You ain't welcome here no more, smart boy.
Lisa, why didn't you warn me? Being a brain has alienated me from all my friends.	Power off, Einstein.
Well, what gets you through the day?	I make a lot of graphs.
A walk? That's a really good idea.	Oh, many things: Tai Chi, Chai Tea... But I find, when I can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk.
I don't understand. That wasn't funny.	Is that your final answer?
Hey, don't blame me. This movie is tired and predictable. You know she's gonna wind up marrying Richard Gere.	Wait a minute! Somebody's not laughing here. It's him!
It's Bill Pullman, you fool!	... ably played by Bill Paxton.
Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?	Point out your plot holes elsewhere!
I'm a Spaulding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Change me back to the blissful boob I was!	Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?
That's ridiculous. You do nothing but play God! And I think your octoparrot would agree.	I'm sorry. We don't play God here.
Oh, that would be heaven!	Look, what if we gave you the name of an unlicensed surgeon?
Moe Szyslak?!	Oh, that would be heaven!
I want you to stick this crayon into my brain.	"So whaddaya want here? Uh, Appendectomy, lipo, or the ""sampler""? That's very popular."
Deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher.	All right, tell me when I hit the sweet spot.
Dee-fense! Dee-fense!	All right, all right.
Extended warranty? How can I lose?	That's pretty dumb... But uh...
Who wants lottery tickets?	Sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere.
We were what what in a what what?	Dad, how could you? We were connecting in such a meaningful way.
The wrestler?	Hey, what's this?
I'unno. Must be sumpin' I wrote before Moe fixed me.	The wrestler?
Huh? Oh, you want a hug. Well that, I know how to do.	Oh, Dad.
Whuzzit... My juice box!	Oh no!
Just give me ten more hours.	Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today.
"Did you say ""Smockron""?"	"They're unveiling a combination apron/smock. It's called a ""Smapron."""
Oh.	"No, ""Smapron."""
Man, that was a good Apron Expo.	C'mon, it'll be fun.
"Heh, heh. ""Grill Power."""	And this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?	I'm a little disappointed. There were too many aprons.
Today!	It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?
Relax, they've got rodeo clowns.	Somebody help him!
That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red.	Hey! Hey, over here! Here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!
Hey, Toro! Here's something to gore!	That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red.
Not now, honey. Daddy's busy.	Da-ad!
Now, for a little calming blue.	Not now, honey. Daddy's busy.
Hey, where's your blue shirt?	Now, for a little calming blue.
I can't complain.	How's your back, Homie?
Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!	Naw, that's for the prisoners. You can complain all you want.
Uh-huh.	Try to focus on something else. Umm... You like Jimi Hendrix, right?
And his fondness for the guitar.	Wow. The artist really captured Jimi's passion and intensity.
Air?	Look, he painted a unicorn in outer space. I'm askin' you, what's it breathin'?
There's an Air in Space Museum.	Ain't no air in space.
Oh God, my back...	There's an Air in Space Museum.
Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?	How's your back, Dad?
What are you looking at?	Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?
First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you.	Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison?
My back!	Oh, Homie. I knew you'd support me.
So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.	Your spine is more twisted than Sinbad's take on marriage.
Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front.	Oh, I'd love to. But, ah, to be honest, modern medicine has a lousy record of treating the back. We spend too much time on the front.
Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors.	I'm gonna send you to my chiropractor.
Less yakkin', more crackin'.	Hello, Homer. I'm Doctor Steve. Please lie down.
Hey, it feels a little better.	There we go.
One, two, better-not-sue...	Honestly, it wouldn't bother me.
Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything.	I'm just yankin' your chain. I'm Jewish.
Yeah, right. I did 'em while you were studying.	Did you do those exercises he gave you?
Yeah... In fact...	Are you okay?
I feel fantastic!	Yeah... In fact...
"Not ""trash can,"" son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending."	That trash can must have unkinked your back.
And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains.	Okay, okay.
Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?	And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains.
You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?	You remember Jack... He's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp.	So, Homer, you think you can fix my sciatica?
Next!	Hey, it worked! My searing leg pain is now a gentle numbness.
Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony...	Simpson, you're not a licensed chiropractor. And you're stealing patients from me and Dr. Steffi!
Not unless you think about the irony.	You've been warned. Stop chiropracting.
Okay, that should do it, Moe.	Careful, I'm frail.
Ah, you saw our bus ad.	Is this El Clínico Magnífico?
We might be able to do business.	We'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device.
Hey, where're you going with that?	We'll need to take some photographs.
Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that.	Whooaa.
Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!	C'mon, c'mon, let's go!
They'll pay for what they did to my can.	Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!
Five? Why don't we make it fifty?	Hey Dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box.
You're gonna regret this.	Five? Why don't we make it fifty?
Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals...	I'll call poison control. Fran, it's me. Just a heads-up.
So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back!	You said it, partner!
Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning...	Smile, please. Thank you.
I can still see your movies, right?	And you are banned for life from all of my performances and TV specials.
...And I never saw Gallagher again.	I can still see your movies, right?
Tom Savini?	Ooh, it says here that special effects whiz Tom Savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!
Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.	I can't believe I'm gonna miss that!
You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm.	How could you have it planned out? You just heard about the problem.
For once in my life I'm tall. Don't take that away from me.	Get him!
Hell-o, I'm Shaquille O'Neal. Let us in, please.	For once in my life I'm tall. Don't take that away from me.
Sorry, son.	You two are not welcome.
No problem.	Thanks for the tip-off.
Woo! Dinner!	Good evening. Sorry... I-I had a really big dinner...
I love the theater.	Sure, computer technology is here to stay. But there'll always be a place for the practical special effects wizard.
Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the Rum District.	Yes sir, partner.
Aw, now, be nice, Moe. This guy just got out of the hospital.	Hey Homer, who's the manatee?
C'mon, you're here to make friends.	Uh, piece o' crap.
I can't decide. I throw myself on the mercy of the food court.	So many restaurants...
And I'll have the beef Wellington.	Umm... I guess I'll, I'll have the chicken Tandoori.
Get that one! Faster! You got half time for the other ones. Oh, good. Oh no, that one's slowing up! Oh, good. Oh, that one's wobbling! Oh, up... you got that before I even said it.	You know what else scares me? Everything!
Hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out.	Oh.
Oh, the whole deal. Coffin. Tombstone. Anti-stink spray.	Hmm. Well, this autopsy coupon appears to be valid. What other funerary services may we provide for the pre-deceased?
What funny names.	"Sir, we prefer the term ""casket"" to ""coffin."" And ""monument"" to ""tombstone."" We have all the leading brands of anti-stink spray."
That thing got picture-in-picture?	Heh, heh, heh. Look at 'im go.
Ah, geez. How come they never call traveling anymore?	"Of course! This is the ""Contempo."""
Whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey.	Ooh, bury me over here. Pleeeease?
Okay!	Hear that? If you cheapskate me into Hell, I'll haunt you good. Imagine this when you're sittin' on the john:
What?!	O-kay, with mole insurance, your total comes to... seventeen thousand dollars.
Mr. Salesman?	Or, you could just toss him in the woods and let the wolves carry him off. It's really up to you.
We're gonna go with the wolves.	Yesss?
But that's just under nine hundred dollars. I wish I could go seventeen thousand, but...	Dad, I love you this much.
Tennis court, eh?...	The Mauso-palooza can be seen from space. It will consume as much cement as a regulation-size tennis court.
I'll bet you didn't see that comin'.	Oh, I can't believe we went through all that, just to wind up with a tennis court.
Of course I do, Dad.	You don't care what happens to me when I die.
And if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all...	Of course I do, Dad.
But try tellin' that to Killy McGee up there.	And if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all...
What on Earth are you doing?	But try tellin' that to Killy McGee up there.
That's tennis?! Then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?	Practicing tennis.
Yes! That's what I wanted!	Foxy boxing?
And finally, make sure the net is tight and springy.	Yes! That's what I wanted!
That seems about right.	And finally, make sure the net is tight and springy.
And it's bad news for the gophers.	You know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. I hear Mel Brooks has one. I mean, Sir Mel Brooks.
Yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over.	And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
Keep walkin', Flanders.	Hey, you got a tennis court.
Fas-ter.	Will do.
Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.	We win again!
And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?	Match point.
Wow. How do you come up with such witty remarks?	That's game, set, and match to us. But the real winners here are Marge's hors d'oeuvres.
Get off my property.	"I guess you could say, ""I'm Iraqi!"""
I've had it with that school!	Especially bonnets.
Door.	I've had it with that school!
Come on, Marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf...	Will you get serious, Homer? I'd like to win at least once.
I've got it! It's in the bag!	Hey, Homer. Here's a bloopie for ya.
Do-I-have-cooties? No. Oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune.	Ever.
Ohhh, well that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie. He's gonna be crushed.	You'll never guess what I heard in the supermarket today. I found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
Okay, now some of that is me.	I thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. Instead, people make fun of our lousiness.
Okay, honey. I can see this means a lot to you. I'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored.	All of that is you. You've gotta take this more seriously.
Uh-oh.	No, it's a smooth motion... You follow through with your racket.
Good news, honey. I found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. I've entered us in a doubles tournament.	Time of death: 10:15.
Don't worry. The tournament's not till tomorrow. Okay, get ready for the serve.	What? We're not ready to compete!
How embarrassing. You take over, Bart.	Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
Lisa! Lisa, beer me.	How embarrassing. You take over, Bart.
I'll be right out, honey.	Lisa! Lisa, beer me.
Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.	Oh, that's okay. Bart's doing fine. You just have another beer.
"So Barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and I'm like ""not even."""	Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.
I'm getting to that.	I don't know what this has to do with the Civil War.
Lookin' good, Honey. I think you and I might just win this tournament dealy.	I'm getting to that.
Hey, Bart. Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle.	Lookin' good, Honey. I think you and I might just win this tournament dealy.
Too busy to reply, huh? I know how that goes. Well, I think I'll go lay out my clothes for the tournament.	Hey, Bart. Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle.
Per-fect.	Too busy to reply, huh? I know how that goes. Well, I think I'll go lay out my clothes for the tournament.
Well, I'm ready for the big tournament.	Per-fect.
Hey there, son!	Well, I'm ready for the big tournament.
With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament.	Oh. Hi Dad.
It's gonna be tough without a partner.	I am playing in the tournament.
Well, good for you! Anyone I know?	I've got a partner.
Good morning, partner!	Oh, hello, Homer.
The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.	Uh, there's something I should tell you.
Yes, darling?	Well, actually, the name of Bart's partner is...
No. No, no, no. You're my partner.	I'm Bart's partner.
Nooo!	Oh, I'm sorry, Homie. We'll talk about it later, okay?
Traitors!	Nooo!
Uh-oh.	Traitors!
I don't think they saw me.	Uh-oh.
Hello, Marge.	I was thinking mantle, too! Talk about being on the same wavelength.
Hello, Bart. How are the tennis partners?	Hello, Marge.
Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.	Oh, Homey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
My manhood? I never thought of that!	I just wanted to win for once. Please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
I don't care about B.C., I care about M.E. My enjoyment.	We can wipe out B.C. in our lifetime.
It's obvious what's happening. I'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me.	I don't care about B.C., I care about M.E. My enjoyment.
Maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.	Dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. You remember the story of Oedipus, don't you?
Who pays for that wedding?	Oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
You're right. But just to be safe, maybe I should chain him up.	I'm just saying you feel threatened by Bart, but it's all in your head.
I think you're underreacting.	Dad, I think you're overreacting.
This session's under.	This session's over.
Badbye.	Goodbye.
No. No. Stay away from my wife, Bart.	Badbye.
That's the guy! That's the guy from my dream!	He thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. But it was the perfect place to shoot him.
Go ahead and smile, smart guy. I'm gonna mop you up like turkey gravy.	That's the guy! That's the guy from my dream!
Absolutely, sweetie.	Are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
No, of course not. Now aim for your mother's heart.	And you're not doing it out of spite?
Oh, come on. You've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. Now serve!	Dad, I don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt Mom.
Hey, leave my teammate alone!	Did you make that awful effigy?
Babies.	Oh, you little-- Come on, Bart.
Don't listen. It's a trick!	Telegram for Lisa Simpson.
I think he's trying to psych you out.	Dear Lisa. Psych. Psych, psych, psych. Signed, Super-psych.
Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down.	"Huh? Ehh, whaddaya want? I'm not gonna do ""A"" material for charity. And after all, that is why we're here."
Did you hear that? She said we're goin' down!	No we're not. You're going down.
Oh, that's loser talk!	All we can do is play our very best.
Unbeatable, eh?	Now I'd like to introduce two of the tennis world's most unbeatable players, Venus and Serena Williams.
Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry...	Unbeatable, eh?
Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new doubles partner. My little girl's a lead weight.	That's our Dad's seat.
Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.	You're dumping your own daughter?
Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!	Yeah, that's pretty low.
Booo! You rot!	Our next match is Marge and Bart Simpson...
Up- bup...	...versus Homer and Lisa...
Now Lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm replacing you.	Venus Simpson? You're replacing me?
Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run across the...	Honey, I'll make it up to you in bottle rockets.
Yeah.	Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run across the...
Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.	Yes! I'm in.
My tennis stick!	Yoink!
Who are you?	My tennis stick!
Which one am I? Serena or Venus?	Come on, let's play! I've gotta tape a Ho-Ho's commercial.
You're a girl.	You're Andre. I'm Serena.
You know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff.	Me neither. I'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
Courtesy of Pete Sampras.	After the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner.
Sorry.	Courtesy of Pete Sampras.
Sucker.	Sorry.
Y'ello!... Hey, Moe. We're watching you on TV.	Oooh, boy. All right, let's see here, uh... Well I was born in Indiana... so that ain't it. And, uh... I better call my Lifeline.
So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?	Yeah, I know, Homer.
Well, it all starts when the nulecule comes out of its nest...	Homer, please. Ha ha. I got a nuclear-type question, here.
A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?	I can't believe Krusty's retiring. This is tragic!
What's on TV?	A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?
Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!	Nutsy the clown.
Oh, yeah, uh, I was at the flower shop today, too. Yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop.	I was at the flower shop.
Take it off!	Thank you, folks. Now, fasten your funny belts, as our own Chimpendale's dancer gives you the Full Monkey!
Go. Blow.	Time to blow up the clown...
38! That's roughly my age! Marge, after a lot of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon.	And in 1984, Portugal's Carlos Lopez becomes the oldest Olympic marathon winner ever at age 38.
Stay out of this, Lisa. Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. Then we'll see who has it tougher.	Well, Dad, I think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life.
Let's see. Sweatbands... check. Anti-chafing nipple tape... Check, check... and check.	You got all your equipment, Dad?
I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!	Attention, runners. On your mark, get set, now get outta here before I change my mind.
And thank you for assuming we're hip.	Well, thank you for lettin' me chill in your crib.
All right, now here's the 411: I'm a record producer, see. I'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for Bart.	And thank you for assuming we're hip.
And my dream is to get rid of Bart.	Please, Mom. My dream is to be a rock star.
How many lives must you ruin?	But...
Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle.	Don't be selfish, Lisa.
YVAN EHT NIOJ. Ya gotta love that crazy chorus.	YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ / YVAN EHT NIOJ. NIOJ!
"Ah, it doesn't mean anything. It's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance""."	What does it mean?
Wait a minute, Bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? That's pretty farfetched, Lisa.	Oh.
Here comes the jealousy bug. Gonna git ya! Gonna git ya!	Are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
I wanna go home now.	Cut it out! You're a grown man!
So, ah, what songs did I miss?	No!
Yeah, that's the look.	Dad, L.T.'s gone crazy!
'Bout time.	Defuse it old school!
"""Smelson!"" It's funny 'cause you smell."	"They called me ""Smelson""! Haw haw."
Am I ever!	Are you sick of ordinary-shaped amusement parks?
Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!	It was all right, I guess.
But... the TV gave me the impression that...	Meh.
We're here.	Maggie, no!
I am a robot. Do what I say.	Squaresville sounds pretty cool.
I am a washing machine. Do what I say.	I am a robot. Do what I say.
Check it out. I built myself a healthy apple.	Come with me.
Yep, a shiny new apple.	But you made it out of ham cubes.
I get it. Everything's made of blocks. Even the water.	Yep, a shiny new apple.
What are you gonna do about it?	Hey, boat twenty-eight, stop splashing!
Uh-oh.	What are you gonna do about it?
Leeches!	Uh-oh.
Welcome to real life, Lisa. You can't fight city hall, AKA Blockoland. So don't even try.	It's okay, but it's missing a piece.
It's what I always tell them. I told them that twice yesterday. And then again as they were going to sleep.	What kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
You're right, honey. Hear that, kids? The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!	I'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
'Scuse me.	Yaaayy!
You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.	'Scuse me.
Yeah, you're right.	Hey, tough luck, pal. You can't fight the Souvenir Industry. We're too powerful.
But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own.	Yeah, you're right.
Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine.	Thank you, Dad.
So, how's that new block I got you?	Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine.
You know, standing up for the little guy felt good. I'm gonna do it more often.	Great!
My heart was in the right place, jerk!	You idiot. They were beating out my shirt fire!
Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?	Thanks again, Dad.
Don't worry, son. I'll handle this.	Bart's got a problem!
Come on! Why won't you go out with Bart?	Don't worry, son. I'll handle this.
Please, ugly is such a smelly word. Who would you rather go out with?	He's a smelly ugly dork.
Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent.	Tommy.
And face it, you're no prize either. You wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. Take what you can get.	Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent.
They wouldn't? Well I'll go to bat for you, honey.	They wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!	Yes, may I help you?
Oh, how clumsy of me? And...	Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!
Oops!	Oh, how clumsy of me? And...
Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed.	Why are you doing zese things?
Oh, really...	I cannot streak that much hair. Think of the cost. I'd be ruined!
Boy, you weren't kidding. Your profit margins are razor-thin.	Oh, really...
Wait a minute. Four hundred a month for loafer lightener?	You see? Zees is what I'm...
You get the same results with a mincing gel.	But we must have it. It is ze lifeblood of ze industry.
The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.	Oh, Homie, I love them. I can't thank you enough.
And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week.	The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.
Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny.	I tried to return my season ticket, but they wouldn't give me my money back. They said they wanted it.
I'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. Is this the executive office of the ball club?	He's wonderful.
Oh.	Nope. This is the equipment shed.
Well, is that it?	Oh.
Is...	That's where we keep the water heater.
I see.	That's a tractor.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Sir, we can't give your friend a refund just because the team is losing.
Yes, sir.	Spin that back to where it was.
Okay. So, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?	This meeting is over.
Albuquerque Isotopes? What is all this stuff?	No, no, not that door!
What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.	It's not anything. It has no purpose.
You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?	No, no. There's no 'ohhhh.'
Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today.	"No, no, we would never abandon our loyal Springfield fans. By the way, all this barging into rooms marked ""PRIVATE"" must have made you thirsty. Would you like a beer?"
Wait a minute. Will this erase my memory?	Now, Homer, we've developed this additive that makes beer super, super malty. Care to try it?
Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?	Good grief.
I was? But I love the swing.	All night. You were yelling at the swing.
"You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. ""I'll be quirky..."" Albuquerque! I'll be right back!"	Dad, you were nuts.
Members of the media...	"You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. ""I'll be quirky..."" Albuquerque! I'll be right back!"
...thank you for coming. The proof that the Isotopes are moving to Albuquerque is right behind this door.	Members of the media...
Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!	He's right, folks. The only story here is the rich, smooth taste of Duff.
I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth.	Well, Homie, I believe you're telling the truth about the Isotopes.
That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.	There's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. Bob Dylan wrote songs. Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.
So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!	Oh, Homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. You eat while you brush your teeth. You're eating a huge sausage right now.
Let's see those double A baseball honchos ignore this.	So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!
My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains.	You're really not gonna eat anything?
Now it begins.	My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains.
Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers.	Dad, I'm so proud of you. If you need some inspiration, here's a book of Mike Farrell's core beliefs.
Don't worry. Duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.	Goodbye, Homie. Here's Dr. Hibbert's number if you feel weak.
Hey kid and man!	Stop calling me that.
Don't support a team run by liars!	Hey kid and man!
They're secretly planning to move to Albuquerque.	Liars?
Why you little...	Yeah!
Nice try, God.	Oh, Seymour!
But Homer Simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... Hey!	Nice try, God.
Stop that!	But Homer Simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... Hey!
DANCIN' AWAY MY HUNGER PANGS / MOVIN' MY FEET SO MY STOMACH WON'T HURT / I'M KINDA LIKE JESUS / BUT NOT IN A SACRILEGIOUS WAY...	I don't do things that way, Lisa.
I'm soooo hungry.	Yeah, but his weary shuffling makes my heart smile.
What's going on? What am I doin' here?	Why don't you can it, Howard?
They're moving the team to Albuquerque!	What?! That's not why I'm here!
Do they have to chew so loud?	Yeah, duck man! Over here!
Oh, I'm wasting away. I'm down to a B-cup.	Do they have to chew so loud?
Why do you look like Cesar Romero?	The spirit of Cesar Chavez.
Why are you here?	Because you don't know what Cesar Chavez looks like.
But I wanna!	To tell you not to give up.
What's happening? Did I crush your corporation?	Okay, Skinny, on your feet.
Me so hungee.	Well, Homer. Your hunger strike lasted twelve amazing days.
So hard to resist. Mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeño relish... Wait a minute, those are Southwestern ingredients!	Of course you are, Hungry Hungry Homer. So why not break your fast with our brand new Isotope Dog Supreme?
Tell the truth! C'mon, everybody!	Now, now, now, now see here, people... Let's not be too hasty.
Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!	Get him out of here.
The truth never tasted so good!	Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat!
What can you do? Sex sells.	That ad campaign may have crossed a line.
They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance.	Homer, you're still here? You should've left for work an hour ago!
Kids gone?	Yeah, somebody should. One-hour dry cleaner. Man, that's fast.
You read my mind. Sooo...	Yep. It's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?
This coffee's good, huh?	You read my mind. Sooo...
You know, I think our marriage is...	Yeah. The uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
I got it!	I got it!
No, I do!	No, I got it!
You...you really scared us.	"""Springfield Baby-Proofing""?"
That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.	Goo goo. Me wike to expwore.
Noooo!	Similac Baby Formula.
This is such an eye-opener. I always pictured the kids dying in the living room.	Noooo!
Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.	Okay, with the window bars, toilet latches, dingo alarm, and grapefruit-squirt shield, your total cost would be... Wow, I'm rich!
Mm hm. Hmmmm.	Here's your estimate.
We don't need your high-priced safety junk!	Mm hm. Hmmmm.
Thank you.	We don't need your high-priced safety junk!
Now don't feel bad, honey. Did you know back in grade school, I had a bully problem myself?	My name's Lisa. What's yours?
EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING...	Now don't feel bad, honey. Did you know back in grade school, I had a bully problem myself?
THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...	EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING...
Good times.	THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...
That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.	They're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. But it might work.
But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.	That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.
She will be.	She's not afraid of bunnies.
See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec.	We're a totem pole.
Ow! Oh, my...	See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec.
Okay Maggie, put it down.	Ow! Oh, my...
It...	Okay Maggie, put it down.
Down.	It...
Oh. Okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore.	Down.
Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is? Baby accidents occur every three minutes.	No, no, no. Oh, Homie!
Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete.	I'm the one who told you that.
Reach into these holes. I use a carrot.	How are you supposed to dial?
Baby could order poison.	Isn't that a little excessive? I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?
Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world.	I'm a horrible mother.
Get her outta here.	Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world.
Savin' those babies. And the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do...	Someone will. I'm gonna crack the bully code.
Problem: a pointy deity. And I've got the perfect solution.	Savin' those babies. And the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do...
Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha.	Oh, thank you. No more Shiva-related pokings.
So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it.	But we are Hindu.
Canceled.	Booo!
That's me! Safety dance!	The safe-baby craze. It's sweeping Springfield, thanks to one crusading parent.
YOU CAN DANCE / YOU CAN DANCE / EVERYBODY LOOK AT YOUR PANTS.	That's me! Safety dance!
Dear God, what have I done?	The dream is over. Shut her down, boys.
Babies of Springfield! We need your help! Please! Skin your knees! Put dice up your nose! Let cats sleep on your face!	Dear God, what have I done?
Woo hoo! Simpsons rule! Sorry.	"I have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. I call it ""Poindextrose""."
So all her bullying was just to get some attention.	Oh, honey, we're so proud of you.
Just to get some attention.	No, Dad! Didn't you listen to anything I said?
Pound that nerd.	Someone's gonna sleep well tonight.
"""Olive oil?"" ""Asparagus?"" If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."	Pound that nerd.
Well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home.	Candy Class.
In the cart.	My teacher said I need cupcakes. Cupcakes to learn.
Cart.	I'm out of wine.
My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that...	We need these because we have... to...
Woo hoo!	In the cart.
Y'know, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun.	Woo hoo!
Wait, I changed my mind.	Syrian hard-liners are gaining influence.
Stack it in the order I'll eat it driving home.	Wait, I changed my mind.
The customer's always right. That's what everybody likes about us. Now mush!	Sir, please. I've already bagged it by color, and in order of each item's discovery by man.
Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day.	Hey, hey, watch what you're doin' there, sack monkey. You're bruisin' my DuraLog.
No you don't...	Please. Ow. Stop. Bag boys have feelings, too, you know.
No, I can handle it. I'll get you, squealer.	Excuse me? Is there a problem here?
Oh, the bag boys are on strike! I'm shaking.	Strike! Strike! Strike!
If I can have this rubber stick.	Mr. Simpson, please. Will you go home?
Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.	Hey, the dog smells something!
Where? Over there?	Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.
Hey!	Where? Over there?
Yoink.	Hey!
My old lunch box!	Yoink.
That Amos Burke made his own rules.	My old lunch box!
Very old animal crackers!	That Amos Burke made his own rules.
Mmmm... turbulent.	Homer, no! Those were made in the Sixties.
Ow! What the hell?	Mmmm... turbulent.
Africa? They're bound to have food there!	"""Find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to Africa."""
And on my free African safari, I want to do everything on this box.	Africa? They're bound to have food there!
I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras.	And on my free African safari, I want to do everything on this box.
Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.	We make household poisons and Christmas lights.
Ow! My eye!	An old box of cookies is not a legal contract.
Woo hoo!	Mr. Simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation.
Hey, mister?	Woo hoo!
On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins.	Uh, yes?
The Simpsons are going to Africa!	On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins.
Just like Jimmy Carter.	He is our leader. He seized power in a bloodless coup. All smotherings.
That's okay. I got 'em.	I will come down for your bags.
Eh, bound to happen.	That's okay. I got 'em.
Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand.	Ooh, look, everybody!
What did you just see, Lisa?	Wait, rhinos don't come from eggs.
What did you just see?	I know, but...
Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born.	That's terrible!
I've got more bones than that guy. If you're trying to impress me, you've failed.	This is the earliest known fossil of a human being. It's over two million years old.
You have failed.	It's not the number of bones, sir, it's the...
By the way, what kind of blood is this?	Oh, thank you. Your ground is so comfortable.
Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!	This song has been going on for hours.
Help! Kitenge!	A hungry, hungry hippo!
Good ol' Kitenge.	Now, Simpsons! Run for it!
Quick! Into the river! Hippos hate water.	Good ol' Kitenge.
It's working!	The left! Go to the left!
Leeches!	It's working!
I've got a map!	Wonder where this river goes.
Monkey. Now, according to Animal Crackers, there's no river here.	I've got a map!
Here's why they shouldn't get anything. One...	Oh, no! We're headed for Victoria Falls!
Not a chance.	Oh, no! It's eating us!
It's a flower.	Wow, Dad. How did you do that?
I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel.	Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet?
Go.	Mount Kilimanjaro?
Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.	Hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas.
Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!	Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
So, I notice your home smells of feces.	Thank you. See, Jojo, she likes it.
And not just monkey feces either.	Yes.
You must be the most boring woman on earth.	Every day I get up at five-thirty, watch the chimps, eat a quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-watching. After dark I come home and think about chimps until it's time for bed.
I mean I knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez.	Possibly, but...
Anything for these noble animals.	Absolutely not! Will you help me defend the refuge?
So like us...	Anything for these noble animals.
Help! Bad monkey!	Somebody light this monkey.
Look at me, I'm a scientist!	She's one of the ten richest chimp researchers in the world.
What a nice lady.	Everybody wants diamonds! Diamonds will make everything all better! Diamonds! Diamonds!
Hey, look! Our tour guide got a new job.	Buzz off.
I was wondering what became of him.	Hm, quite a promotion.
Now he's just a stinking flight attendant! Hey, where's my pillow?	/ Oh, he got overthrown!
Breakfast!	Breakfast!
Aww... Cereal? You know I like my breakfast fried or chicken-fried!	Breakfast!
No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast.	I'll get us out of this. Say Dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?
Well, let's put him to the test. Me love beer.	Meet Linguo, the grammar robot. I built him all by myself. If you misuse language, he'll correct you.
Aw, he loves beer.	I love beer.
Here, little fella.	Aw, he loves beer.
Ooo, can I have a brownie?	This is why I can't have nice things.
Ooo, can I have dinner?	They're for after dinner.
Homer wants a brownie! I'm gonna get one!	You can't have a brownie. Period.
Comin' in from the left.	No!
Or is it the right?	Stop it!
Look out for the reach-around!	Homer!
He shoots, he sco-- My thumb!	Look out for the reach-around!
Oh God oh God oh God!	He shoots, he sco-- My thumb!
Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!	I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
"Reattach a thumb? This isn't ""Gattaca."""	Calm down! If we hurry, they can reattach your thumb.
Nobody's gonna tackle you.	Okay boy, drop the thumb...
Come back with my thumb!	Nobody's gonna tackle you.
Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back. You want people food? I can get you people food.	123 Fake Street. Got it.
I have nothing he wants.	Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back. You want people food? I can get you people food.
Give me back my thumb!	What the diddly-yo?!
Gaa!	Give me back my thumb!
Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me in bed with four beautiful women.	We've gotta get to the hospital, Homer!
Marge, over here.	Homer, help!
But I have finger insurance!	I'm sorry, Homer. Your H.M.O. doesn't cover this type of injury.
Symmetry, eh?	Well, I could cut off the other thumb for a sense of symmetry.
We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.	Hibbert's really losing it. We're going to Dr. Nick's.
Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb!	We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.
Thanks, Moe.	No problem. Just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle brine. That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... Although I do like the occasional beer...	Hey, ah, hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?
"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"" Total rip-off of the Smurfs. And the Smurfs? They suck."	Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... Although I do like the occasional beer...
Where's Marge?! That is so rude. I know, I'll hitchhike.	I've gotta get to Dr. Nick's!
Oh, why isn't this working?	Where's Marge?! That is so rude. I know, I'll hitchhike.
Hey, thanks for stopping.	Oh, why isn't this working?
Oh, crap. It's on fire!	If anyone ever tells you a hog won't eat a finger, they's lyin'.
Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?	Inflammable means flammable? What a country!
Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.	Hey, somebody done stoleded my wheels.
It's too late.	Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
Well, old friend, we always knew this day would come.	It's too late.
Say goodbye to your brother.	Well, old friend, we always knew this day would come.
What in the hell was that?	Say goodbye to your brother.
Linguo, dead!	What in the hell was that?
No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast.	I'll get us out of this. Say Dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?
Here, little fella.	No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast.
I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot, like in that play I wrote.	Dad, no!
My thumb!	Hang on, Linguo. You'll be up and conjugating in no time.
Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb.	Oh.
"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"""	Not right now. Your father's in there and --
Abra-ca-thumbra.	Hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick.
Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.	Hey, somebody done stoleded my wheels.
What the hell...?	Bad grammar overload. Error! Error!
Linguo, dead!	What the hell...?
Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!	It's all right, boys.
One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven.	Exactly.
To Heaven!	One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven.
Christ be with you.	To Heaven!
Leave Ned alone.	No, I'm not!
He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out.	Thank you, Homer.
Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned?	He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out.
Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties.	It says I have cooties.
Hey, she's coming this way!	That was great. I can't believe she found a rhyme for Hezekiah.
Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.	Eh, they'll all go to hell. Say how's your life going?
Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime.	That's great. Maybe we could have coffee sometime.
He can hear you, Rachel.	I can hear her, Homer.
Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?	Okay, well maybe another time. You know, I better go check into my hotel.
Yeah, maybe it was too soon.	Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all.
Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?	Yeah, maybe it was too soon.
Say bye, Mr. Flanders.	Always do.
Yeah, a lifetime of memories.	Poor Ned. He can't look anywhere without being reminded of Maude.
Sure, of course I do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth.	Homer, don't you have any respect?
Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up.	Wow, three pairs of shoes. Someone had a fetish.
Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money.	Kinda.
What? That doesn't sound like me.	You said we were doing this out of friendship.
Ahh... Is that a fact? And you think you know someone.	Maude's old sketch book. She was quite the little artist, you know.
Hey, how 'bout that?	Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream.
You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.	Ah, Gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene.
"Relax. It's a ""controlled burn""... Uh-oh."	Are you nuts?
Uh, yeah, teenagers.	Darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? Can they do that?	Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude.
I am. I'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.	Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff.
No problem. I'll need a sack and something sharp.	Well thanks, Homer.
Oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams.	You can have these, ah, fireworks I confiscated. Some Chinese people claimed they were celebrating New Year's in February.
Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?	This sawdust will soak up the puke from the rooller-cooster. It's Willie's special blend.
Don't say that, Ned!	Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park.
I'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other Godly hoo-hah.	Yeah, I wanna hallucinate too!
Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it.	Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation.
Stupid grill!	Oh, there's no explaining God's will, Roddy. That's like explaining how an airplane flies.
Why won't you light? The gas is on full blast!	Stupid grill!
Good idea.	You better stick your head in and see what's going on.
Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.	I've gotta close Praiseland down. Someone could get hurt.
Ned, Praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. Look at those smiling faces.	Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.
Rich laughing with poor...	Ned, Praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. Look at those smiling faces.
Bullies breaking bread with nerds...	Rich laughing with poor...
Orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... Lighting candles!	Bullies breaking bread with nerds...
Christ be with you.	May the Lord have mercy on your gas sniffin', orphan beatin', soul.
Ooo, Ned, look who's here. It's that girl you don't like... not!	Hey, Ned! I just read about your park in that horrible Triple-A magazine.
I think Ned is gonna be all right...	So, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?
You got that right	I know. We'll never see any of you again.
Pick me! Pick me! I've got hoop dreams, coach. I've got 'em bad.	My turn, huh? Let's see...
"Yes! Losers! Lo-sers! Lo-sers! L-- You said ""Homer,"" right?"	Okay. Homer.
Lo-sers!	Mm-hm.
Okay guys, I've got a secret play I've been saving for the Olympics or possibly the Final Four, and it goes something like this... Uh, Skinner I want you... Moe, you can take ... Homer, you can take Groundskeeper Willie. No way am I taking Groundskeeper Willie. Yes you are. Are you a team player or not?	Willie tickles the twine for two! Oi! Oi!
Eat my dust, mortals!	Oh my goodness, an untied shoelace. I'll just get down on one knee and retie that.
I'm okay.	Eat my dust, mortals!
Ow!	I'm okay.
Did you say anterior?	Homer, I'm afraid you've torn out your anterior cruciate ligament.
Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.	Now, how did this happen?
I don't know, I'm still a little hazy.	Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
Oh, yeah. Now I remember it like it was yesterday...	I don't know, I'm still a little hazy.
Hey man, you're harshin' my buzz. Anyway it all started when...	It happened today.
Jet-son!	You go, Homer!
Maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.	We've got to get you into surgery.
Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.	But it will take plenty of time and rehab before you can go back to work.
"But ""Dr. Screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!"	Oh, you're also responsible for this hefty hospital bill. You shouldn't have ordered all those hospital haircuts and porno films.
Run!	"But ""Dr. Screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!"
Two weeks?! Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit on my ass and watch TV? That ain't my style, man!	Now Homer, I want you to stay off that leg for two weeks.
No they don't.	Now, Homer, there are people right through that door that have it much worse than you.
Everyone's having fun but me.	No they don't.
I'm so bored.	There goes my wagging finger.
This place is so boring. I've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. I know, I'll breed the pets. To each other.	Sure it is.
Soon I will have a miracle hybrid, with the loyalty of a cat and the cleanliness of a dog.	This place is so boring. I've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. I know, I'll breed the pets. To each other.
Oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. Stupid Flanders.	Hey, Homer!
Well, Marge isn't here. She had to identify a body at the morgue.	It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?
Well, they would keep me company. And this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal.	Would you mind watching the kids? I'm kinda in a pickle here.
Sure, knock yourselves out, and call me Homer.	Mr. Simpson, can we have another jelly and candy sandwich?
Daddy's not here, is he?	Daddy said it's rude to call grownups by their first name.
That is the darnedest thing!	Pokémon? Pokémon? With the pokey and the mon and the...
Yeah, well. How was the concert?	He told us how the world keeps screwing him over.
Hey, it was fun. My kids are sick of all my stories. But they just can't get enough of me!	"Well, sir, I never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. Anyway, thanks again."
Don't tell me what I'm not doing.	Oh, Roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center.
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?	So you are running a day care center?
Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face.	Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school.
That's the one.	Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face.
It's just a legal thing, to protect me.	Why did you put my name on the sign?
See for yourself.	Is your knee really gross under there?
Sure. Go for the gusto.	Can I touch it?
It knows you're afraid.	It's healing over my hand.
Aw, aren't they sweet. Any medical things I should know about?	Yes, whatever, just take them!
I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it.	Why, Homer, your surgical incision is completely healed.
Wonderful. Being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. Ya got any?	Ah, yes. How is your day care center doing?
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!	Always with the morphine.
Peek-a-boo!	I've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
Okay. IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS / MY FRIEND / THEN LET'S KEEP DANCING...	Uncle Homer, will you sing that crazy song we love?
Yes, but then I discovered the joys of raising children.	Yeah. Hey, Homer, I thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better.
Don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. Then you'll know my joy.	What about us?
Huh?	Well, don't worry. This'll give his heartstrings a much needed plucking.
Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day care permit. Sweet.	Huh?
Umm-hm.	Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day care permit. Sweet.
Aw, that's my girl.	I contributed by not objecting too much.
Is there a snack table?	Anyway, this film crew... will shoot some behind-the-scenes footage of your amazing work.
Don't film this.	It's already set up.
'Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...	We're just restin' our eyes.
Sorry. Daddy thought you were a pile of cable.	Ow! You stepped on my arm!
My kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.	"Tell me about the ""Homer Cares"" program."
Yes, through the magic of caring.	Awww. Did you make 'em yourself?
I'll mace you good!	And the winner is... Principal Skinner!
Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you don't...	"This year's winner of the ""Saint Who Walks Among Us"" award..."
Yes!	... Homer Simpson!
All my love has come back in trophy form.	Yes!
I'll call.	And he gambles like crazy.
I almost had a straight!	Three nines.
Hey, what's the deal?	Come to new papa.
Well, I'd rather reserve judgement until I... oh my God!	We just spliced in some home movies. Whaddaya think?
That is completely taken out of context!	Well, I'd rather reserve judgement until I... oh my God!
Why you little...	That is completely taken out of context!
No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!	My polite indignation has no bounds.
Run, children! Run!	No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!
Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty chocolate milkshakes!	Where are we going?
I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.	Where are we going, Mr. Simpson?
Uh oh.	Then you better turn.
Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I showered love on those other children while ignoring you?	All right, fatty, out of the pipe!
Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two are the only kids I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie.	Yeah. / Pretty much.
Now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.	Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two are the only kids I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie.
Yeah, that'll happen.	The Teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
Teamsters.	Yeah, that'll happen.
The Simpsons are going to Delaware!	I can't believe it. We won another contest!
"Hey, wait a minute. ""Airport tax, five dollars?"""	You're next, Mr. Simpson.
Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it...	Sir, it's a standard fee.
Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.	Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it...
The Simpsons are ridin' the rails!	Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
What are you gonna do to us?	Mornin', folks.
Man, buffalo are easy to kill.	There's only one man who can save us...
All right, but your next story better be worth it.	Well, I s'pose I could spin ya a few more yarns... But first, who wants to give me a sponge bath? I'm filthy.
Oh, this'll be good.	Okay, ready for another impression? This is Southside Jake tearin' into Tin Can Tillie.
A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.	Dad, you just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo!
I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J.	"And her family changed theirs to ""Buffelkill."""
What have I done? What have I done?!	The buffalo are gone. I think you shot them all.
Aww...	Yeah, I suppose you could grind some pills into it.
Big deal.	Ooh, look out there, folks. That's the mighty Mississip.
I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.	And that was Tom and Huck's last adventure.
I'll meet you in Wilmington.	I believe I told three stories.
Raise your arm... Okay, the other one...	Close the door.
Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird.	You know, I do four hundred sit-ups a day.
It--	Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird.
Ew!	It--
And it's important to feel good about yourself... Okay, spread your toes. Do you know how much glass is in here?	Oh, not at all. I like when people say nice things about my body.
Ah, Ethnictown. Where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy, overfed Americans.	Splendid, Batsy. You've done it again.
Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.	BABIES, WHO WANTS-A BABIES...
The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday.	I sense you live with much misery.
A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. See, this wart is a fake!	I sense I should not take a check.
So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.	Get out.
Beads!	So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
Owww!	Beads!
Hey, that's me. And that's you.	You've ruined me! Oh, why didn't I see this coming?
What-ever.	You stupid, stupid man! I curse you! You will bring bad luck to everyone you love!
Are you coming on to me?	What-ever.
Good as new.	Gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens.
Well, I... There. Right as rain, there.	Good as new.
Guys, I am not cursed!	Yeah, but a lot harder to catch. Uh, go with the leprechaun.
Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!	Well, okay, but hurry up.
When did that happen?	Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!
Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves.	...ya big fat ass!
Good idea, Mr. Ed. Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?	Maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, Irish-style!	Ah, the cursed one. How's that curse I cursed you with, Cursed-y , hm?
Yah!	I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, Irish-style!
Wake up, ya lousy drunk!	Yah!
Ew! Nasty!	Hold me close... kiss me I'm Irish...
Yep. Everything worked out for the best.	The best thing about a gypsy wedding is I'm not the hairiest woman here.
Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.	What? Bart is dead!
She's not the boss of me.	The gypsy said it would.
Mm, various eggs.	Dinner is served.
Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!	Bravo, Pierce!
Oh, I agree.	Uh-huh. Absolutely. / Yep. /
Yeah, that's the price of success.	Homer, my dear fellow. You're carrying quite a bit of tension in your back fat, Homer.
What's my blood alcohol?	Can I top you off?
Keep 'em comin'.	Point one five.
Yeah, she's cool.	You know, Marge is quite a remarkable woman.
Lucky, shmucky. I knocked her up. But she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. But if I died, she'd be completely free. For man or machine.	You're certainly a lucky man to have her.
Yep, a machine.	Machine, eh?
Mm, unexplained bacon.	Showtime...
Good ol' table.	Mm, unexplained bacon.
Huh?	Good ol' table.
Yep. Man one, machine zero. How do you like that score?	Homer! Homer, you're alive!
Die, you monster!	We have to disable its central processor! C'mon!
Well, I am missing the back of my head. I think you could cut me some slack.	Dad, that's the water softener!
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.	Homer, no!
Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special...	Oh, how magical!
My sweet little angel!	She'll be killed!
Hey, we stayed for your kids!	Shazbot.
WON'T YOU MARRY ME, BI-ILL? / I GOT THE WEDDING GOWN BI-ILL / 'CAUSE WEDDINGS ARE NI-ICE...	Can I turn on the radio?
Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!	Oh-ho-ho. If our Wampum Wagon spots your KBBL Party Penguin, you'll win forty dollars!
End of the line, boys.	Hey, there's the Wampum Wagon!
I love our court days.	"""Silent?"" That doesn't sound right."
Judge Snyder? While we're young?	Yes they are, Roy.
I'll bring the car around.	On the other hand, I was young once.
What'd she say about cupcakes?	Don't spit on my cupcake and tell me it's frosting.
Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol.	According to this, your father was driving you to school? Then where was he when you stole the police car?
And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.	You abandoned your son to win forty dollars?
Coooool.	And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.
"Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", I think you'll agree that..."	And that was more important than keeping your son out of trouble?
I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.	I'm familiar with B.O.C. But you have got a boy here who is crying out for adult supervision.
It won't?	Sorry, Bub. That crow won't caw.
Tethered?!	I hereby order you to be tethered to your son.
Room five?!	Tethered. Report to room five.
It's a little tight.	There we go. How's that?
I used to be.	Sir, you are not a size four.
Oh, this punishment is so cruel.	I used to be.
I'll medicate you...	Well, maybe it'll be fun. You'll get to spend more time together. Make sure your father takes his mood medication.
...honey. You know, this could be fun. Race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball.	I'll medicate you...
Bo-ring.	Today we're going to talk about predicates and predicate nominatives.
Come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff.	Mr. Simpson, I'm trying to teach.
Fine.	Will you please just go back to sleep?
Cobras!	Night terrors, ma'am.
Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism.	Cobras!
Swing!	Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism.
Run, Bart! Pump your thighs! Pump them...	Swing!
I'm with you, son!	Hurry up, Dad!
That's my boy...	Wow, my first home run.
Cobras! Cobras!	C'mon, hug me...
Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really hurt.	Cobras! Cobras!
I thought I would hate working nights. But it's so peaceful. And there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.	Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really hurt.
Sure, boy.	Can I ask you something, Dad?
Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?	The town keeps getting bigger. Will there always be enough electricity?
Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes...	Uh, I don't think Lenny's house has a steeple.
Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learning a lot about each other.	Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes...
I hit my head, Moe.	Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer.
Since when?	Hey, hey. No kids in the bar.
All right, all right. Come on, Bart.	Oh, the heat's been on since them Bush girls were in here.
That's my little slugger.	I'm cold and scared.
Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundred dollars!	C'mon, Dad. Let's go.
Yeah, they're Italian.	Really?
Moe? What the?...	All right. Hand 'em over.
It's about time. Oh.	There's a new judge in town with a hard-nosed approach to juvenile crime: punish the parents.
"Well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."	Granted. But you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for Bart. He might even make the honor roll, if Dad can control his night terrors.
Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.	C'mon, Dad. I gotta go to the bathroom.
No!	Come on, Homer.
Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!	Homer, just take him to the bathroom.
Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head.	Would you mind? I'm trying to do my homework.
What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.	Oh, Homie, no. We can't.
Why not? Kids are very visual these days.	I don't want him to see us expressing our love.
But...	No!
Hey, shut up.	The lady said no.
Ow! Why you--!	You shut up.
Because I... Ow! You--!	What'd you do that for?
Ow!	Ah!
Why you little...	I'm sleeping in the bathtub.
We're free! Your mother set us free!	She's such a butthole.
Woo hoo!	We're free! Your mother set us free!
Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha.	That's right. It's me, Judge Harm, through the magic of fiber optics.
But, Constance, it only happened because...	Quiet, Tubsy. You violated my order.
Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly...	No!
I admit it.	You two need to wake up and smell the java. And the first step is to admit that you're bad parents.
Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately.	You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much I love my kids.
Well, that explains the sign.	Not yet. No. Today the judge wants you to bend over so people can spank you from their cars.
"You know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. And you don't even have to say ""bad."" It could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""	Hey, no extension cords!
You're right. It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.	I just can't do that, Homer. It's a matter of principle. And I need you to support me in this.
Easy... easy...	But first we gotta break out of these stocks.
Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders...	I want goggles, too.
Hey, Marge, surf's up!	Ahh!!
Well, we tried all those other tools.	You're using my table saw to violate a court order?
Woo hoo!	Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as...
Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's start skulking.	If that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious.
It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be a milkman.	Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's start skulking.
This address must be wrong.	Concentrate, Homer.
She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool.	No. No, there it is!
I know, I know. Fight the power.	We hate her, Homer.
Cops!	Let's do this thing.
Look at her in there, washing her body...	Let's go.
I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her.	And help me with this banner.
Oh Lord, guide this cinder block...	She's gonna find us!
Uh-oh.	Homer, no!
Hey, how ya doin'?	My house!
So... it cost you nothin'.	That quilt was made by my grandmother.
That was close.	We promise.
Just the radio, dear.	What's that noise?
"The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never know what he'll do next. Hm... Aw. Look at that dad in ""Drabble."" He's like an unfunny version of me."	What are you reading, Homie?
Probably digging for drugs.	That's odd. He's outside, digging.
No. Of course not.	There's no drugs out there.
Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up to. Kids shouldn't have secrets.	O-kay then.
Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging, isn't it?	Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up to. Kids shouldn't have secrets.
Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?	Yep.
So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig a hole of my own.	Nuh-uh.
Maybe I will.	Go for it.
Very little.	What's stopping you?
I'm having chest pains!	Very little.
Where's the defibrillator?	I'm having chest pains!
Clear!	Where's the defibrillator?
Yes. Eventually, I became King of the Morlocks.	Homer, is this story goin' anywhere?
You callin' me a liar, Carl?	But Morlocks are from the future.
Oh, I just naturally assumed.	Yeah. How'd you know the Chinese were spyin' on ya?
Woo hoo!	Oh, I just naturally assumed.
Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately.	Ah, quitcher bellyaching, coffee boy. You're lucky I let ya in here.
Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. You're always pointing that shotgun at us.	You take that back.
Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.	But, can you blame me? Every day it's the same old routine. I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and I never get one stinkin' tip.
That was an amazing throw.	Ah, who am I kiddin'? I ain't smiled for real since I nailed that rat with the ice pick. Ha, remember that?
Hey, where'd that painting come from?	Ahh! How did I lose my passion for the job? When I was in bartending school, I thought I had the world by the jigger.
Ooh, ooh, pick me!	But who'll run the bar while you're gone?
Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.	... And if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell.
No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.	Hey, what are you doin'? I gotta pay for that!
I thought you said you had to go.	All right, look, I-I gotta go.
Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?	Aw, geez. The old college clock.
Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?	Hey Homer, do you mind if I bring in some outside food?
But on the other hand, Moe's not here.	Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?
For what? A little splattered food never hurt anybody. Now everybody shut up and dance!	Sorry. Sorry.
Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.	Hey, what happened to the music?
Ayyy!	Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.
Oh! Whoa! Hemorrhage-amundo!	Ayyy!
Ayyy.	Are you gonna be okay?
Yello?	Moe Syzslak, you old glass wipe.
Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?	But, where are the bar stools?
I don't get it.	Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.
What's the gag?	"Yell out ""I'll eat a booger."""
I'M A WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET, GONNA OPEN MOE'S BAR / I'M A SINGIN' WHAT I'M THINKIN' / HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG.	Hey, don't you wanna take your shoes off before you go swimming? Professor? Oh. Oh. Um. Mm.
Huh?	I'M A WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET, GONNA OPEN MOE'S BAR / I'M A SINGIN' WHAT I'M THINKIN' / HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG.
Teenage vandals smashing the bar! Moe's gonna kill me.	Huh?
You dirty teen.	Hey, Homer.
Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?	Hey, Homer stop, stop! It's me! Geez.
Wow, well I I almost fainted, but then I didn't. What are you doing?	Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?
And it would look pretty, too.	My Professor said if I prettied up this dump, it would renew my zeal.
Hi, Formico.	I am Formico. The Dean of Design.
Sorry. He seems nice.	Ah, ah, ah! My name must never be spoken.
It's not fair. Just when I was getting to be the world's greatest bartender, it's all snatched away.	Sorry. He seems nice.
Freshen your drink, pal?	It's not fair. Just when I was getting to be the world's greatest bartender, it's all snatched away.
There you go, doll.	Just leave the bottle.
Look, buddy, I don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here.	There you go, doll.
Wow, It looks like an alien headquarters. Couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? Couldn't ya? Hey, wait up.	Wow, check out the new Moe's.
Not for friends of Moe's.	Uh, looks like a long wait to get in.
Don't you know who I am?	Is your name on the list?
Cecil is a girl's name.	It's okay, Cecil. They're VIPs.
Um... the rabbits are cute.	Yeah, ya like it, Homer?
Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.	Ain't it trippy?
Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.	We don't serve Duff no more. We got a Malaysian beer that's better than Duff... It's made outta soy sauce.
Okay, look cool.	Models?! Ha. Oh boy!
That's it!	This is creative design run amok!
I'm gonna tell Moe exactly what I think of his...	That's it!
Moe, we want our bar back.	"And ""penis"" is Russian for..."
Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turned into a big phony.	Eh, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in your dark spot.
I'll throw myself out, thank you.	Is it? Oh, well that's it. That's-- Dagmar, Julian, throw this bum out.
I believe I had a hat.	I'll throw myself out, thank you.
Suckers!	I believe I had a hat.
I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.	Whatcha doin', Dad?
It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.	This is pretty far to go just to spite Moe.
Beautiful.	It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.
But when I'm passionate about something, I see it through to the end.	Running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
'CAUSE MOE'S A BIG JERK AND A SHE-MALE TOO!	I WON'T DRINK AT MOE'S / HOMER'S OLD GARAGE IS ALL I NE-ED / I WON'T DRINK AT MOE'S...
Barkeep!	That calls for another beer.
It's the family bar. Right, kids?	I thought this was gonna be your bar.
As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.	Can we go to bed now?
She's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. Hee, hee.	But you're not even using them.
We're rockin' great!	Hey, what's going on?
I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.	How'd you get REM to play in your garage?
Seems to me I already did.	What the-- You can't open your own bar!
"Bar? I see no bar. This is a hunting club...Which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."""	But it's illegal! You can't run a bar in a private residence.
Which I'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy.	"Ah, here we go. It also says, ""a licensed hunting club must actively engage in the sport of hunting."""
Lemons...	Hunting? Dad, no!
It's the law. My hands are tied.	It's not fair, Dad. Why should an animal die just because you and Moe are fighting?
Okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. Come on, turkey. Join your friends.	It's the law. My hands are tied.
I would.	Do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey...	You do? Then I like you, too. Here, have a towelette.
Nobody's gonna kill you.	Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey...
All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man.	Oh, that actually feels good after the... after the crotch.
What the hell is that?	All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man.
A cougar! Die, cougar!	You did it, Moe!
Got that cat right in the leg.	My leg! Aww, geez!
Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!	Dad, you shot Moe!
Son of a...	Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!
I'm sorry I shot you, Moe.	Exactly.
Hey, who invited the hippies?	Aw, I'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have Thanksgiving dinner together in this bar.
All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest.	I did. You owe REM an apology for, eco-fraud.
And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender.	Oh, come on, Bart. Smell those curds! Mmmmm, curds.
And here you go.	Ah, here you go, pal.
"Ah. And now to read my fortune. ""Geese can be troublesome."" What the hell is that supposed to mean?"	Fortune cookie.
Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that.	Oh... Fortune means: Geese cause problems.
Oh, these fortunes are terrible.	Every house has a bathroom.
These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness.	Is there a problem?
Easy.	Well, with all due respect, sir, I suppose you could come up with better fortunes?
You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.	Well?
"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher."""	Show them.
"Let's see. ""You will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" ""Your store is being robbed, Apu."" Are you getting all this, Lisa?"	Please, Yung Mee was a hack compared to this guy.
Stop that dog! It has my gum!	I'm sorry, Monty...
Yes, Mr. Burns.	Look, there's one of my young chums now. You there!
Ummm...	Tell my young sweetheart here of our youthful exploits.
Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!	Play along, Chubsy. There's a pie in it for you.
Oh. He ran his own casino, stole the Loch Ness Monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun.	Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!
C'mon, he's a total player.	Well...
Windowsill.	Where did you get that pie?
Burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go.	New underpants? Homer, what are you up to?
You're right.	Well, don't look too hip. You don't want that girl falling for you.
These would stop Joan Collins herself.	You're right.
Yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns.	D-- Oh, uh, constantly. When we're not being kicked out for our rowdy, youthful behavior! Eh, pally?
Yes, Mr. Burns.	Put my hand on her knee.
Oh, sorry.	I said her. And I said knee.
No problem.	I'm going to make such love to you that, oh, you'll forget all about Rudolph Valentino. Turn left here.
But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted.	All right, you're dismissed. I'll take it from here.
Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.	"Did you hear that? That ""excellent"" was... excellent."
You're going to ask her to marry you?!	Back in a moment, my dear. We have to, uh... uh... expel some urine.
Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?	Isn't it wonderful? I'm head over heels in love.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!	Monty! It's beautiful.
Let go of her or I'll scream!	My ring!
Well, this is my house. Ah--	Well she's run off... with Simpson!
Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape.	Uh-un.
Pistol whip?!	Don't say that, baby. I'm gonna win you back if I have to pistol whip this guy all night.
Mmm... pistol whip.	Pistol whip?!
Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?	Almost there.
You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.	Let me guess. Now you're going to start working him over with the brass knuckles. You Are so predictable.
Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?	Wow, you don't get it.
Hmm...	I swear I can change, Gloria. I'm taking classes in computer fraud.
Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.	I don't like bothering people at home.
Just a little more.	Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.
Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?	"I know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in front of the burning house and say ""Channel 6 is hot, hot, hot."""
What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.	Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart.
Oh, I know.	I don't get it, Simpson. I'm a bad boy.
You mean a Van Dyke?	What do I have to do? Grow a devil beard?
Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear.	Burly. You're so rugged and manly...
Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey...	Fantasize, Marge. Fantasize about Burly.
Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too.	Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey...
Ooo, Mama Celeste.	Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too.
"""Love""? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!"	"""Dear Burly, comma, I've never written to a registered trademark before. Are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? In either case, I would love a signed photo. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."""
Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels.	Person-to-person?!
I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?	How did you get my number?
Perfect. I'll be there at seven.	Oh, my goodness...
I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?	Playing a prankeroo, eh?
So, how was your day? Did anything unbelievable happen? Phone calls, things of that nature?	I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?
Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up.	You're not going to believe it. That paper towel lumberjack is coming here! For dinner! Tonight!
Why look, it's Chad Sexington!	Oh my God!
It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her.	Now you've done it. You really humiliated Mom.
How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?	I suggest dinner and a show.
No, huh?	How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?
Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings.	I guess it was a pretty funny prank. I like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
Zing! What's a Skeletor?	Hey, smart move, four-eyes. Sittin' next to Skeletor here makes you look like Hercules.
Do me! Do me!	Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?
I am in your power. Boss me around.	Do me! Do me!
Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!	When I snap my fingers, you will transform into... a... famous historian.
Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!	Thank you. Now you are... Emily Dickinson.
I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!	Now, you are a young boy... ah, yourself, at twelve years old...
Oh, that's better...	Ah, yes, yes. Um...
Here you go.	We'd better get him home.
Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...	Well, is anything coming back to you?
Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys.	Try to remember back when you were twelve. Something frightening must have happened.
It was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. And to kill the boredom, we sang.	Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys.
Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming...	And there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. I mean, who likes getting muddy? It's terrible. Okay, let's go to Moe's now.
Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...	Fine. Crap all over my theory.
Hey come on...	Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses...	You found a corpse when you were twelve? No wonder you've been so traumatized.
Oh, hey, you guys can come with us.	Oh. Okay. Well, we'll just be going, then.
Bye, Moe.	Oh... Oh, okay. Well, uh, I'll see ya.
Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away.	Bye, Moe.
Never!	Stop saying that, Dad.
This is it. This is the old quarry.	Seventeen seventy-six. How much is left in my checking account?
Someone's yellow belly is showing.	Maybe we should come back in the daytime.
And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.	Ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart.
And someone has eaten the flesh.	It's the body!
Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?	And who sent it down that pipe?
Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!	With this film.
Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though.	Ha, busted!
Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry.	We'll never know, sir.
Why? He'd just bury it.	Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?
Seems kinda pointless now.	Oh. Well, you wanna take a look at it anyways, uh just for ha-has?
Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.	Okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. Or is it a nine? You don't know. Uh, this is gravel. Okay? Gravel. This is uh, that's more gravel. Okay, oh. This is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... Now, that sounds crazy, right. But if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. I mean they run the other way. At first I was just fishin' with the helmet thing. But then from the mouse's reaction I got, I got a little more concerned.
WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD.	You know it is.
Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts.	Hey Dad, will you help me build this model rocket?
Science!?	I didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
Mmmm, pie pants.	"Uh, he didn't say science... he said ""pie pants."""
This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three...	Mmmm, pie pants.
Two... one...	This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three...
"The word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence..."	Over here, Guv'nor.
Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen.	"The word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence..."
What was that?	Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen.
I have eyes, don't I?	Wow, did you see that yaw control?
I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.	I have eyes, don't I?
Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good.	Well, then, could you stop calling us nerds?
Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, where's America's newest hero?	Super. Now if you'll gather around, I'd like to say a few words. All nerds clear the launch area.
Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God.	Oh, that's sensible.
Five, four, three, two, one... COUNTDOWN!	Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God.
Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds...	Dad, the rocket's off course!
Don't worry, I planned for this.	Now it's headed for the church.
You say that so much it's lost all meaning.	This is the worst thing you've ever done.
'Cause he's all man.	Why does Jesus have a lasso?
Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!	That's it!
I don't know how to feel.	Oh no...
Got it.	You should be very upset.
How was that?	Got it.
So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!	Yayyy!
Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy.	Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over...
Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.	I'm a Buddhist.
I think this tree could use an angel.	Just do it. Do it. Do it now!
It's go time.	I think this tree could use an angel.
I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.	Well, Santa can take it back because I'm not ruled by material desi-- Is that a pony?
Bag's in the kitchen.	More sugar, please.
I did it. I found our dog. Now our Christmas is complete.	Hey, he can't do much without this.
So you're back on the winning team?	Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys.
That's all I ever asked.	Uh huh.
A grizzly bear with a chainsaw. Now there's a killing machine!	These trees are our national heritage!
No problem. There's plenty of activities inside.	Oh. We'd better stay inside. At least until the squirrels stop melting.
The TV!	He smelled like puke!
New shooter.	Hey, where'd they go?
Oh, we'll see about that.	That's it, baby. Welcome to Marvin Gardens.
One, two, three.	Oh, we'll see about that.
I'm good for the rest, you know I am.	You're a little light here, Dad.
They told me it would be like this on the outside.	Well, I'd like to trust you, Homer. But you've been in jail three times.
Why you little...	Who else is gonna take care of her? Dad?
Police brutality! And chew-tality!	And we carried it out as a family!
Stanford.	Take it back! Take it back!
A heavenly choir. You must be an angel!	Hello, I'm Gabriel.
"No, you are an angel like Denzel Washington in ""The Preacher's Wife,"" or Will Smith in ""Bagger Vance,"" or Slimer in ""Ghostbusters."""	No, that's my pager. I'm a social worker. I'm here to help you stop fighting and become a family again.
Don't blame me, blame Tinseltown and its second golden age. May it never end.	Sir, we know you're not an angel. My husband sees too many movies.
"Okay Gabriel, this is a ""bar."" It's where I go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia."	Food keeps my family happy, so I make a few practice dinners before showtime. 'Cause at six o'clock, we go live!
Well, not with that temper.	Homer, I am not an angel!
Look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. Marge, Bart, girl-Bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. How I loathe him.	Well, not with that temper.
Okay, why are we in the woods? Is this heaven?	Look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. Marge, Bart, girl-Bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. How I loathe him.
...Which is society's fault because...	Homer, your problem is quite simple. You're a drunken, childish buffoon.
Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please.	It's your fault, Homer. But I've got an exercise that will help all of you break out of the roles you're stuck in. Who feels like lunch?
Cooperate?! This is one family that doesn't swing that way.	You'll just have to cooperate.
Gimme that beer!	...And plenty of beer.
Okay, family huddle.	We've got to do something, but what?
Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted.	Okay, family huddle.
Okay, but talk like this.	Look, we can't fall into old patterns. We've gotta think of a plan.
What?	Fine, I'll talk like this.
Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together.	What?
Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!	Give them the food!
No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz.	Give them the beer! It will impair their motor skills!
Hey, they're all right.	No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz.
WOLVES AND COUGARS ATE OUR ROAST BEEF!!	WE ARE FAMILY!
I knew it!	Well, I think you all did great. You broke out of your normal roles to accomplish something as a family. I've really earned my wings.
Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.	You know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger.
Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!	Could this be the end of our series... of events?
Give it to me, baby.	Homer and Ned, you may now kiss your brides.
It's okay. We're married.	Homer!
Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liquors drunkened me.	You and Ned married a couple floozies?
Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you.	If I Had known there were loose women in Las Vegas, I would never have let you go.
Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went. We never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee.	Get out, Homer.
You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!	Homer, I don't know if I can ever forgive you. Please go away.
Please, just leave me alone.	Of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass, this is the worst.
Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop. Oh, yeah...	Now, now, Momma's gonna make you a snack.
Faster... Faster... Faster... Oh, you do that like a pro...	Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop. Oh, yeah...
Use both hands...	Oh, no. She's making him a sandwich.
Can't panic! Must remain calm.	I gotta tell ya, this is pretty terrific. Yeah.
Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remember why I'm sleeping on the lawn.	Can't panic! Must remain calm.
Marge, you're speaking to me.	Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remember why I'm sleeping on the lawn.
Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?	Why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
Not a sports fan, huh?	Bigamy.
You know, there are only so many times I can say I'm sorry and still mean it!	You insensitive jerk! Maybe this family would be better off without you!
I would if it wasn't for the kids.	Why don't you just take Britney Beers and get outta here!
Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's.	We had a good run.
My lady's glass is empty, Moe. Bring her another cookies 'n' creme martini.	Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's.
You know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face.	Gee, Homer. Your new wife is great. Her lips look like night-crawlers.
To Amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.	Wowww.
Woo hoo!	Oh, sure. He paid for the hour.
I don't know.	Why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
Okay.	It's got pictures of deformities.
Oh my God! Wow. Now that's a goiter.	Okay.
"She said ""tavern"". I'm going to Moe's!"	It was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.
Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen.	All right. Outside.
"No, the best book you've ever seen is Tom Clancy's ""Op Center."""	Wow, that's the best book I've ever seen!
Ooh, here's a good one: The World's Most Overrated Saint.	That thing knows me better than I know myself.
I've used up all these records.	Francis of Assisi .
That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes?	Why don't you try to set a record, Dad?
The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else.	Only on Mars.
You're a cinch to be World's Fattest Man.	The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else.
I'm here to break a world record. What's the longest anyone's ever done this?	No, I'm here for the greatest living actor.
Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.	Three years.
Wait, wait, wait...	Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.
But it's my banjo.	Uh, technically, the cobra would get the record. He's the one playing.
"Yeah, they're called ""Congress""."	Mr. Simpson, there are thousands of people like you with no discernible talent.
Okay.	Shut up.
Group stunt?	All the individual records were set by crackpots who half-killed themselves. The only way someone new can get in the book is with some kind of group stunt.
Denver?	Like that town that made the world's largest omelet.
Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records.	No, Spanish.
We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!	/ What's he talking about?
Okay. Lemme check the specs.	I haven't seen this much flesh since Elke Sommers' hot-tub party. Seriously, Elke's great. Always there for sick kids. Doin' great things.
Wow, my vision is coming to life!	Okay. Lemme check the specs.
Mm-hm.	Wow, my vision is coming to life!
All right. I'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow.	Mm-hm.
Why you little!	Yeah, Dad! You can be the world's laziest stunt organizer!
Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules!	Wait a minute.
Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!	Everyone, welcome to the Duff Book Of World Records: Springfield is the World's Fattest Town!
Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I can finally stop sucking in my gut.	Haw haw.
Yeah, you can't improve on nature.	You kids do eat a lot of sugar. But at least Homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit.
Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?	If you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture.
Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage.	Oh, hello Homer.
It was dinner.	What are you talking about? Is that dinner?
I was hoping we could do that together.	Why didn't you just turn off the oven?
Oh, I am so proud of you.	Silence! I rule in favor of Marge Simpson.
Get in the car.	And, thanks to Marge's Simpson's damning evidence... I hereby ban all sugar products from Springfield -- forever!
Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort.	"Good evening. Our top story: Springfield's cake-hole has been shut, forever. Under what has been dubbed ""Marge's Law,"" all forms of sugar are now illegal."
Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine.	I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
Nothing left! Nothing left!	My baby! Where's my baby?
Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!	Nothing left! Nothing left!
Part of me knew that.	Mr. Simpson, you are licking blood and Vapo-Rub.
I'm with you all the way. But first...	There is a small group committed to bringing sugar back to this town. By any means necessary.
Cool. Should I take off my shoes?	I'm with you all the way. But first...
Cool.	Cool. Should I take off my shoes?
Count Fudge-ula? I thought you wanted to get off the stuff.	Gentlemen, I have found the final member of our cabal.
Oh, you mean Tennessee?	Homer, we need you to help us smuggle in sugar from south of the border.
I'm only doin' this one more time.	There is the island!
Eww. I touched it. Over.	I think he's grossed-out by some seaweed.
Kinda.	Get a grip, Simpson. You're doing fine. Now, do you have your map?
Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psychology. I don't want that stupid map.	Kinda.
That wasn't part of the deal!	Okay man, there's the sugar. Now you give us the money.
Has everyone keistered their personal supply?	Well, we're almost home.
'Cause I sure haven't.	Has everyone keistered their personal supply?
No way! We'll defy you to the death!	Surrender or prepare to be sunk.
Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles?	No, I'm having one!
Let's do it.	Yeah.
Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-Loompa.	Good work, Simpson.
That guy is freaky. Well, here's your sugar.	He's right over there.
No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich.	Mm. I guess you just can't use the law to nag. Maybe I should just stop trying to change the world.
That's what I told Lisa!	That's the best one!
Ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine.	Hey, I found some pearls. Oh wait, they're just my teeth. Well, I can still make a necklace out of them.
Ooh, they're showing the filling now. Can they do that?	Ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine.
What the hell is that?	Ooh, they're showing the filling now. Can they do that?
Rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... This is the Gay Pride Parade! Woo hoo!	What the hell is that?
Look at those abs.	Ooh, a salute to brunch! Wave to brunch, Maggie!
Everyone here has a six pack and I'm the only one with a keg.	Look at those abs.
"Four tickets for ""Shenani-Goats!""."	That's it, we're outta here.
I'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. Show the movie!	Uh-oh, the professor said not to let him get a boner.
Stop the madness! Start the movie!	Well, if we wanted to live forever, we wouldn't have become ushers.
I'm not scared of those ushers! What are they gonna do? Advance on me?	Homer, you're going to get in trouble.
So long, suckers!	Litter is my most treacherous foe. I would like to eat its children.
Broken jaw?	Homer, you've suffered a broken jaw.
Mm hmm.	But breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. Maybe we can go.
I'm horny!	This has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
Nicely done.	Homer, your breath smells terrible. I'll have to take off my shoes to cover the odor.
And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen.	Nicely done.
I learned so much about my family. You'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.	And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen.
I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.	Uh, hey, how ya doin'?
Sure thing, Alky.	I'm an alcoholic. Homer, will you appear on my show?
Krackle was my favorite.	Well, he would eat all the time. We'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of Hershey's Miniatures.
Ostrich burgers! Get your ostrich burgers!	He did such crazy things -- roll clip.
Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death.	I'll take one.
Dude, I thought we were friends.	Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death.
I'm not proud of that clip.	Dude, I thought we were friends.
Well, I don't know. The demolition derby is next month...	Do you promise not to wevive your weckless, weckless ways?
Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert.	Please, Homie? No more craziness -- for me?
I'm gonna kill you!	Hm, all clean, just the way I left it.
"Yes, and I was merely reading the title: ""I'm gonna kill you."""	We're rehearsing a play.
Yep. Nothin' to get excited about.	"Yes, and I was merely reading the title: ""I'm gonna kill you."""
Professor Van Doren, so good to see you.	Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?	This place is so dull. The nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey.	It's seven-thirty!
Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...	The Demolition Derby? That'll scratch my itch.
What?! Nooo!	Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...
Listen to all that revving!	What?! Nooo!
Drivers, start your engines!	Listen to all that revving!
But bold moves are no longer my forte!	Dad, you've gotta do something.
Oh, what do I do? What do I do?	She could get hurt!
Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas for me ass.	A man on a donkey! Never in my six weeks on the job have I seen the likes of this.
Aw, looks like a little angel. Now to save me Marge.	Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas for me ass.
That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket. The kind I like wrapped around me.	This family needs a live wire, but it's just not me.
Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!	Ooooh.
Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.	Let's approach with caution!
What's goin' on?	Pretty much. Yeah.
Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya.	Oho! Trouble in paradise.
Spill it, moneybags.	Homer, Marge, I have a rather delicate proposition.
It's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs.	Yes, I do have everything. But yet I often wonder what life with Marge would have been like.
"Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much sex would be involved? 'Cause if it's ""some""..."	Homer, I will give you one million dollars to let me spend a weekend alone with your wife.
Hey Marge, I just thought of something.	Hey, where's our parents?
If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery. Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need.	What?
One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.	Besides, I like some of the noises you make in bed.
Yeah, I...	Wow! Homer, that was amazing.
Honey, did you get any sleep?	Yeah, I...
Oh, I'm so sorry.	Honey, did you get any sleep?
Uh huh.	Are you snoring while you're awake?
Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff.	You need that surgery. We'll have to call Artie.
And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any John Woo film--	Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff.
This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday comin'.	Remember, Homie. I'm doing this for us. See you on Monday.
Yeah. Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.	This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday comin'.
I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old boyfriend.	Yeah. Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
Gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... Swings in the old battin' cage.	I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old boyfriend.
Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?	And you get more sprawl space on the bed.
Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late.	Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe.
That's enough running.	Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late.
Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once again I have no date!	"Come, dear. We can dance all night. The band hasn't worked since the wrap party for ""James at 16"". Some say they're cursed!"
Hello, Dondelinger.	Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once again I have no date!
Just for twenty-five years.	You're not on the guest list, Simpson. Orders of Prom King Ziff. And have you been drinking?
Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be born!	Okay.
Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing a far superior man.	Ah, he's gonna sleep tonight.
My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?	Oh yeah, make me the bad guy.
Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.	Sounds like a plan.
I saw something terrible, and I can't even say it so I'll have these two dolls do it for me.	Homer was there?
I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma.	But I can explain!
Patty and Selma? Screw that!	I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma.
Just run the camera, you little...	Patty and Selma? Screw that!
Goodbye, my darling.	Just run the camera, you little...
Oh, it's no good. Everything reminds me of Marge.	Goodbye, my darling.
What did Carl think?	I carved that one wonderful summer.
Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? Something indoorsy.	You know, we've never discussed it.
This job'll be perfect. I'm gonna leave this world the way I entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman I love.	I'll put you on rig thirteen, as soon as they burn off the corpses.
Another oil well successfully capped.	No. But when it does... hello!
Marge?!	Looks like we're goners. Oh well, circle of life.
Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? I don't think so. Good day.	Ain't ya comin', Homer?
"We said ""Good day""!"	But, Homer...
Woo hoo!	Listen to me, Homer. You've won. You own Marge's heart. And that's something I could never buy.
Artie, thanks for saving my life. Now, I believe there's a little matter of the million dollars...	Carl Carlson!
Oh, I can't take his money... I can't print my own money... I have to work for money... Why don't I just lie down and die?	We can't take his money.
I gotta hand it to Artie Ziff, Marge. That little nerd saved my life.	I'm Artie Ziff!
Goodnight, honey.	Goodnight, Homie.
No. The Olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!	For God's sake, Homer. Give them back their flame!
You wait 'til next month! You wait 'til next month!	You can always find your favorite shows next month.
I'm bored. Heyyy... a fair!	Nooooo!
But knowing about it would make you want to go here.	"""Springfield Preparatory School?!"" Dad, you told me there were no private schools in Springfield!"
Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?	Hello, and thank you for coming to our fund-raiser. I'm Headmaster St. John Van Hookstratten.
Ow!	Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?
Monkeys cry.	Monkeys point.
Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!	It's one of the places.
Sorry.	Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!
Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flanders bids fifty dollars.	Good show!
Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is.	No, I belong here! Pleeeaaase!
In South Carolina.	Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is.
You will too!	I will not be a Gamecock!
"Look, boy. Here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."	It's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
What the hell is that?	"Look, boy. Here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."
Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?	That car's as big as all outdoors.
Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us. Be cool.	Homer, I see your daughter is one of those whale-kissing, Dukakis-hugging moon maidens.
Hello, gentlemen. Would you care to meet my new best friend...	Ohhh, he'll sleep tonight.
Rainier Wolfcastle.	Hello, gentlemen. Would you care to meet my new best friend...
These courtside seats are great. Thanks for the hookup, Wolfie.	So how much you lookalikes make? 'Cause some say I look like Macaulay Culkin.
That I do, sir.	I just want my daughter to be happy. Plus you eat the pretzels I drop on the floor.
DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!	Yeah, I guess.
Ouch! I sat on something sharp!	DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!
I have a Boyle on my ass.	Oh, that's just Lara Flynn Boyle.
Cockfight.	And where were you?
Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?	...so to win Greta back, I have to go to Toronto.
All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!	Maggie, what do you think?
Doesn't matter. They have free health care.	"Dad, no. It says ""don't walk""!"
Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?	Oh, you'll win her back, eh. And B, we're closing in five minutes.
There she is, boy.	The geek shall inherit the earth.
Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back.	I don't know, Dad. What if she's still mad at me?
Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gonna take a nap.	But she might say no.
Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie.	"I said ""let's go""."
Oh, right.	Dad, it's a documentary on the homeless.
Really? Ooh, this I gotta see.	A crazy dog's trying to kill me!
Oh, he just wants to make friends.	Really? Ooh, this I gotta see.
Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh what dee de bobo! Echee chee googie!	Oh, he just wants to make friends.
He's a good doggie!	So Bart, when does the killing start?
Look Bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason.	Ooh it-it ooh googie googie!
Just you wait!	Well, right now, I'm supposed to be in school.
Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?	I guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks.	Buck gave it to me. He's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. I wanna grow up to be just like him.
It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food...	Bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
Swell.	Aw, Homie, you'll always be my western hero.
Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald.	Dad, why are you wearing that?
One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.	Gee Buck, your old films are as violent as today's!
CAN'T KEEP IT IN...	SIR YOU CANNOT PEE / UNLESS YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE...
I've seen fancier.	Boy, that's some fancy shootin'.
"Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you?"	Live, from the corner of Zany Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, it's the Krusty the Clown show. With special guest Buck McCoy. And now, here's Krusty!
I've seen drunker.	He's drunk!
For shame!	Did I forget to mention I'm an alcoholic?
Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall.	Sorry don't suture my colon. And you're off my show forever!
Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?	That is just grotesque.
Yes!	Eh, we could try it.
My son lost his hero. This should be the greatest night of my life. How come I'm not happy?	Yes!
Stop saying that.	You care about Bart's feelings.
Nice old man. Don't break a hip.	Seventy-six.
Mmmm, something smells delicious.	Buck, if you walk out that door, you'll be branded a quitter forever.
I'm still not givin' up on Buck. There must be some hare-brained half-assed way...	Well, I don't see how it is. Nobody's even told me your name yet.
Get me Buck McCoy.	Ah, please, everyone, stay away. We don't want anyone to be a hero. A hero. A hero!
Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car.	Dad, I'm on the LINE.
That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?	Are you crazy? I'm a movie cowboy. And you're no Howard Hawks.
You don't need that.	Fine.
Dad!	Not to mention this.
Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!	Dad!
Aren't you forgettin' someone?	Buck, you're my hero again.
And don't you forget it.	Well, there's Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, America's firefighters and then you, Dad.
Not now, Marge. I'm waitin' for the new XFL season. Who will win this year's Million Dollar Game? Who? Who?	Honey, I've got some bad news for you.
"The ""X"" is for extreme!"	Honey...
Who told you?!	There is no XFL this year. The league folded.
And he never even lived to be a vegetable.	Homer, your father's dead!
Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him.	"It's Grampa's smell. ""Old Old Spice."""
"Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was ""in love"" with him."	But you were very open with your feelings.
Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a second chance.	"Me? I ain't dead. It was Stimson down the hall. So much for Mister ""I can button my own shirt."""
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll call you. Or send you some fruit.	Yeah, there's so many things we can...
You sunk my Scrabbleship!	B-6.
Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.	This game makes no sense.
Semper fi.	Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.
You? No way. It's too dangerous.	I wanna drive again!
That was a D.W.I.	Well, you're no angel behind the wheel. What about your D.U.I.?
Well, you brought me into this world, so no.	Please, son. Driving is my last chance to feel alive.
Dad, get up.	Fine, I'm dead.
No way.	Woo hoo! And I want driving gloves!
Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it.	I got me a date with Zelda, so I need the car.
Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!	Why don't we double date? Then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
No you can't.	Cut it out. I can work the brakes myself.
You're slow to react, Dad.	No you can't.
In real life he would die.	Dude sure got his comeuppance.
Hey, watch the movie.	Oh, Zelda.
Give me those keys. Do you have any idea what you put us through? I called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... Okay, this isn't about who I called.	Well, I gotta do something before the Viagra kicks in. I know, I'll suck my teeth. Whoa, here we go.
Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.	Oh, everybody trusts Lisa. Precious little Lisa, apple of her Daddy's eye.
Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive.	Grampa, I gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie.
Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.	Shut up! You don't know her! Zelda loves me! I HATE THIS HOUSE!
No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn.	He used to be such an angel. Maybe you should give him another chance.
Cosmic.	He is your dad.
And another thing: no death races!	Death race?
Oh, that is it! Abraham J. Simpson, you are never driving again!	Huh?
Ever!	Oh, that is it! Abraham J. Simpson, you are never driving again!
Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father.	First he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. Your father's out of control.
We've gotta go after them.	So You've Settled for Branson.
Uh, we'll wait for the next one.	Yay!
Here we are: Branson, Missouri!	Mass hobo grave in cellar...
Only in public.	Son, can you forgive an old fool?
Overdue book?! This is the biggest frame-up since O.J. Wait a minute... blood in the Bronco... the cuts on his hand... those Jay Leno monologues... Oh my God, he did it!	Homer, you got a letter. Hm. It's from the library.
Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day.	"Here's the book... ""Classics for Children?"""
I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?	Why don't you read to us now?
"Hm, ""Homer's Odyssey."" Is this about that mini-van I rented once?"	I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?
That mini-van had the biggest cup holders. And change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!	No Dad. It's an epic tale from ancient Greece.
Fine.	Dad, I loved it, too, but it was seven years ago.
It was the end of the Trojan War. Clever Odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the Trojans once and for all...	Fine.
Stupid King of Troy. I think I speak for all the Greeks when I say this war has gone on for too long.	Hi-O-diddily-ysseus!
Anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. We hope you don't have a horse.	I'll say. I'd really like to go out and get the mail.
Trojans.	Now, throughout history, when people get wood, they'll think of Trojans.
"If I'm laughing at what I think I am, it's very funny. Anyway... ""As night fell, the Greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""	What are you laughing at, Dad?
Now, I can return to Ithaca, and my sweet wife Penelope.	Remember, just 'cause their heads are off, it don't mean they're dead.
Forget it. Sacrificing animals is barbaric. Now have the slaves kill the wounded.	Odysseus, do not forget to thank the gods for our victory with an appropriate animal sacrifice.
Gentlemen, I must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me.	You gonna be askin' that the whole trip?
Boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!	THE FETA IS CHEESY / THE SIRENS ARE EASY...
Almost home!	Oh, where could your father be?
That pig looks like Lenny.	Thanks for your help with the anchor, guys. Guys?
Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.	Hey!
I'm still hungry.	Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.
Those were my friends?!	Didn't you eat enough of your friends?
That's it, I'm going home. Which way to Ithaca?	Yes, I've been saying that for hours.
This truly is Hell!	YOU'RE MY LA-DY / OF THE MOR-NING... /
Honey, I'm home!	This is the face that launched a thousand ships. The other way!
Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long. But I'm gonna do something I haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash.	Well, look who the Fates dragged in.
Sweet Penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when I left.	Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long. But I'm gonna do something I haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash.
Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.	Brave Odysseus, it has been twenty long years. Regale me with tales of your adventures.
Oh, here's the story of Joan of Arc...	Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.
"This one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""France..."""	It's never Joan Van Ark.
"...The French were fighting the English, in The Hundred Years War, which was then called ""Operation Speedy Resolution."""	"This one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""France..."""
Son, how's it going with the breakfast pâté?	"...The French were fighting the English, in The Hundred Years War, which was then called ""Operation Speedy Resolution."""
Victory? We're French! We don't even have a word for it.	Victory.
Burn this guy! He lost our good bucket!	Don't burn her! She's just an innocent child!
Wow.	Huh. Getting kind of hot around here.
"Our next story is ""Hamlet,"" by William Shakespeare."	Well, it's easier to chew than that Bambi video.
"I don't know, but that would be hot. ""Once upon a time there was a young prince of Denmark."""	Cool. Does he get to marry his Mom?
It's cold outside. You'll need a sweater. A sweater!	Could that fat ghost be telling the truth? First I've got to get Uncle Claudius to confess, then I've gotta kill him.
"Son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. Called ""Ghostbusters."""	Are you crazy? I can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
Now that's what I call a moon shot.	"Now that's what I call a ""moon shot."""
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.	Dad, that line was in the cartoon.
Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?	Our phone bill is four hundred dollars! They charged us for a call to Brazil.
Choke on your lies!	No sir, I didn't.
Which phone company? There are hundreds of them. And they all keep changing their names.	Homer! They must have made a mistake. We'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
We are not paying this bill.	We've been charged for calls to Brazil that we didn't make.
Fine, I'll cut off your ponytail.	Fine, I'll cut off your service.
Marge, it's called negotiating.	Homer!
Ooo, fascinating.	Marge, it's called negotiating.
I told you, I have too much time on my hands.	Why must you fight with every utility?
Why didn't you call me?	Homer, we were cleaning out a cooling duct at the plant and found a box of old taco shells!
That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant.	Oh we tried. But a recording said you were a bunch of deadbeats.
Get me tools and beer.	Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme...
Free service, here we come.	Yes!
All right, let's try the red one.	Free service, here we come.
Okay, I'll try the green.	All right, let's try the red one.
Let's try the red one again.	Okay, I'll try the green.
Not again! Ow! Let's try 'em together.	Let's try the red one again.
How did I get here?	Maybe the red one...
The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.	What call to Brazil?
Yeah, the one we both like.	You made that call? But you're the good one.
Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember.	Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your allowance with a poor Brazilian boy.
No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.	He's so adorable. Can we have another baby?
I said forget it!	No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him.	I am like sugar to them.
How many people live in Brazil?	Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him.
Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.	Not if we buy our tickets on the internet. It's really cheap if we change planes in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun City, and East St. Louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now.
The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil.	Except Antarctica.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold?	Okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer.
And in February... it's hot?	That's right.
So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies...	Mm-hmm.
So hot snow falls up?	No Dad, it's just the weather.
Woo hoo!	Yes.
Forget every word, boy. It's useless.	Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!
Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country.	Look, it's the giant statue of Christ on Corcovado.
Way ahead of you, Marge.	It says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
TAKE ME TO THE HOTEL / MY HANDS ARE ON A GUY'S ASS / BOY THIS DUDE MUST WORK OUT...	Way ahead of you, Marge.
Look Marge, I'm Brazilian.	Boy, they sure love soccer here.
I got it, I got, I got it.	How to Loot Brazil?
Hey, and a mini-bar hat.	Look, the room came with a fruit hat.
...I WILL EAT THIS TOBLERONE / AND I WILL NOT PAY!	I'M CHIQUITA BANANA / AND I'M HERE TO SAY...
There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right?	While you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there Ronaldo is waiting to be found.
Ooh, they look like Skittles.	Yeah, check out the rats.
Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?	We're never gonna find him.
Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?	We nuns cannot fly.
But you're on vacation, honey. I'm not wearing my wedding ring!	You know I'm a vegetarian.
Check please.	We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'.
Does that include tip?	Ah, si?
How did you know?!	Excuse me, Americans...
Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well.	I feel so European.
I hope they're goin' somewhere good.	Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well.
"Okay boy, let's strut our stuff. I GO TO RIO"") I'M IN RIO / AND I'M WALKING ON THE BEACH / I'M IN MY SPEEDO..."	I hope they're goin' somewhere good.
Gimme a drink with all your sweetest Brazilian fruits mixed together.	You can't protect her forever! You stupid lady.
Sweet. Sweet! SWEET!	Here you go.
Ahhh...	Sweet. Sweet! SWEET!
Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search?	Everything here is something.
Taxi!	Just one, and it's across town.
So that means I don't have to pay the fare.	My American friend, I'm afraid that this is a kidnapping.
Woo hoo!	I suppose.
Fine. Take me, but let the boy go.	I'm afraid you don't appreciate the seriousness of the situation.
Eh, same old garbage!	All right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?
This corn doesn't look so big.	Oh, you two! We're eating genetically modified vegetables! Look how big they are.
What?!	That's baby corn.
You ain't pretty no more!	I'll regroup at Red Lobster!
Aw, look. I've made some friends. And now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!	You ain't pretty no more!
So Lisa says by killing their enemy, I became the alpha-crow.	Aw, look. I've made some friends. And now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!
I'm sure he'll turn up. Look, here's one of his buttons.	I gotta admit, I-I'm kinda nervous, here. We haven't seen Barney since they enveloped him.
There's Russell Crow, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddly, Hume Crow-nyn, Gregory Peck...	See? They got the little stools and everything.
It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder.	Homer, I'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom.
Drop it in, don't cram it in. Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself.	I'm sleeping on the couch.
Awww, look, Maggie wants to fly too.	Drop it in, don't cram it in. Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself.
Oh, thank God you're okay.	Hey, cut it out! Put her down!
Okay, that was not cool. We need to lay down some ground rules--	Oh, thank God you're okay.
We'll get to that. Right now, I think we need some time apart--	Caw! Caw!
All right, that's it. Shoo, you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!	Caw! Caw! Caw!
That is not a worm.	All right, that's it. Shoo, you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Ow! Ow!	That is not a worm.
I hate getting stitches in my eyes. Stupid crows.	Ow! Ow!
Hm, fascinating. Say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?	Don't be mad at the crows, Homer. They weren't trying to blind you. They were just trying to drink your sweet, sweet eye juices.
Does it go in the butt?	Well, there is a medication, although it's a little... controversial.
Look, man. I don't do drugs.	I'm talkin' about medicinal marijuana. Prescription pot. Texas T-H-C.
I had a bad experience with drugs...	Homer, for your eyes, the best tonic is chronic. You're not afraid, are you?
For me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight.	Smell any drugs, Sgt. Scraps?
"But isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?"	But Homer, you can't let a single bad experience scare you away from drugs.
"Okay, let's see: ""Toke as needed. Caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."""	You want the wizard or the skull?
SMOKE ON THE WATER / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO	It smells like the art teacher's office.
"THEY BURNED DOWN THE GAMBLING HOUSE - IT DIED WITH AN AWFUL SOUND / I AM HUNGRY FOR A CAN-DY BAR / I THINK I'LL EAT A ""MOUNDS""..."	Uh-oh.
Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal.	And now I'm guilty of possession! I could go to prison! Unless I testify against you...
I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.	Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal.
"Marge, I just realized: I am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". And if you tell anyone..."	Hello?
Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out.	Hello?
I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...	Dad, I thought you didn't like her saxophone.
Which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets Daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. Ever.	I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...
Sh-sh-sh.	Dad, it's one a.m. And I'm out of saliva.
Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders! You got the mustache and the didilly... Okay, now do Wiggum.	Hidilly-hey, Homer!
Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you.	Homer, i-i-it's me, Ned.
"""Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that He Himself could not eat it?"""	Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you.
Now you know what I've been goin' through.	Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle.
Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?	Well, luckily, I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers.
Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.	...The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. The End.
Done and done. Now, do Wiggum.	Well, I know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.
I said Wiggum!	Well, okay... I, I guess it would go something like this: All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?
Oops! I thought this was the can, man.	Smithers, I need someone who laughs at all my jokes. You know, honest feedback.
You just said it!	Well, you're a Happy Homer. What's your name, young man?
You're covered with a very fine fuzz.	Oh Smithers, I would have said anything to get your stem cells. Now, welcome aboard.
Hardly working...	You're covered with a very fine fuzz.
Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?	Where did you get that suit?
"Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""Yes-I-cannabis."""	Look, I'm really starting to worry. There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!
We have a kitchen?!	"Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""Yes-I-cannabis."""
Look at Shemp! He is so high!	You mutton heads, this is why we can never hold down a job!
"And ""Otto"" is ""Otto"" backwards."	"Whoa-ho-ho-ho. Hey, ""Shemp"" is ""hemp"" spelled backwards."
As soon as I graduate, I am so outta here.	Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?
We gotta get out and stop that initiative. Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos.	This just in: the Marijuana Re-Criminalization Initiative took another step forward today as supporters collected the final signatures required to place it on the ballot for next Tuesday's election.
Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs...	Thank you. And now, a man who's a real poth-ead ... I'm sorry, pothead... Homer Simpson!
'Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!	/ Jobs? / What?
"Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""The Matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. Medically."	/ Yes! Yes!
So my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday the seventh...	"Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""The Matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. Medically."
Oh man, they already voted. And we lost!	Uh, Homer? That-that was yesterday.
Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands.	What are we gonna do?
Although, wow!	Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands.
Eyes? What the hell are you talkin' about?	Homie, you don't need drugs anymore. Your eyes are all better.
All right. I'll do it for my kids.	Homer, it's over. I want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again.
Never!	As long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house.
Get out.	Yeah, I can still crash here, right?
Oh, yeah. Get out.	Remember when I dropped my keys and, and you thought the phone was ringin'?
Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.	What's the matter, Homer? You're drunk but you're not like sloppy drunk.
Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this.	Dad, you just said that three minutes ago.
As a reminder, Marge.	Why are you keeping that thing?
Y'ello.	As a reminder, Marge.
But I can't find you funny anymore.	Ahoy-hoy, executive V.P. I'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors and I need your generous guffaws.
This stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.	I'm going to take a bathiola. When I come back, you'd better be laughing.
Start inhalin', Waylon.	This stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.
You mean that guy on 60 Minutes who yells all the time?	This suit used to belong to Judy Garland. Ah, we could sing a song if you don't mind being Mickey Rooney.
Oh, man. Oh, man. We killed Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad.	Oh, Mr. Burns! You were too beautiful for this world.
So what? Mr. Burns is dead.	The investors' meeting is in twenty minutes.
And now a man you will see is definitely not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!	Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a Fox attitude.
Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip your speech and go directly to the questions?	And now a man you will see is definitely not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!
Mr. Burns, may I field that one?	two, what's that red stuff coming out of your ear?
It's true we're losing money...	Mr. Burns, may I field that one?
But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away.	It's true we're losing money...
And you wanted to take him to the hospital.	Yes, I regained consciousness during my big dance number. Those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber.
Waiting for my wife. She has a surprise for me.	What are you doing here anyway?
"Did you say ""life story""?"	Hey, hey, hey. I didn't ask for your life story.
Things started out great. I ate what my mother ate. And my mother loved chili. Then, suddenly:	"Did you say ""life story""?"
Don't you have criminals to catch?	Wow, tell me some more.
My father and I were never really close.	Now, where were we?
I never found true happiness until I met Marge.	My father and I were never really close.
And life just gets more exciting.	I never found true happiness until I met Marge.
Then came the day that changes every couple forever. The day we got our elephant.	And life just gets more exciting.
While I wait for my family, I'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss.	Then came the day that changes every couple forever. The day we got our elephant.
Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together...	Yeah. Hop in, Homer.
All my other senses are getting sharper. Bart, you had pizza for lunch. Lisa, you're extremely depressed.	Now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on.
Kathleen Turner!	Hey Homer, do you remember this voice?
Are the proceeds going to charity?	Where tonight we're roasting you, Homer Simpson!
Woo hoo!	Hell no.
That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this?	Excellent.
I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies.	Now everyone knows Homer loves his family...
You name it.	We will not destroy the Earth...one condition.
Stupid lawn chair!	Hm, all I need is one classic character...
Come on... unfold you...	Stupid lawn chair!
Ow!	Come on... unfold you...
This'll teach that stupid chair. I'm on fire! Oh, I hope no one's drawing this. Ow!	Hey...
Always drawing your old man, huh? You must think I'm the greatest dad in the world.	This'll teach that stupid chair. I'm on fire! Oh, I hope no one's drawing this. Ow!
I hate them so much!	Don't you hate carpet stores that charge extra for the under-padding?
Why do people keep moving it... stupid...	What's it to ya?
That guy's hilarious. I especially like his white shirt and blue pants. Wait a second... Angry Dad is me!	That's opinion, not news!
What kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?	Which makes you ten trillionth over-all.
"Stupid ""Bart-toon""! Bart-toon, that's clever. I'm gonna kill him!"	Why that little...
Leave me alone!	You heard the freak!
That's just so obvious!	How'd you like to be played by John Goodman?
I'm just passionate -- like all us Greeks.	Dad, I'm no fan of Bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger.
Oh, I am...	No, you're angry. Look, you're punching the cat right now.
Oh my gosh, you're right. I'm a rage-aholic. I just can't live without rage-ahol!	Oh, I am...
Is it also the last step?	Congratulations, Dad. The first step is admitting it.
I said anger.	If you ask me, you should give up fatty foods.
I gave up anger forever. From now on, I'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers.	Homer? What's going on?
Hello there, Flan-didly-danders.	Come on, Angry Dad. Get angry! Don't make me do a clip show!
THEY CALL ME MELLOW YELLOW... QUITE RIGHTLY! THIS FELLOW NEVER BELLOWS... QUITE RIGHTLY!	Yeah, but at least now that my show's cancelled, I don't need material, so there's no need to lure my Dad into the trap I set up for him. The trap!
Time to put this ordeal behind me.	Dirty diapers on strings!
Homer mad! Homer smash! Get revenge on world!	Thank God his pants stayed on.
Well son, I wanna show you how grateful I am. Let's go fishing.	Okay.
Who knew that anger was savin' my life?	Well son, I wanna show you how grateful I am. Let's go fishing.
You're trying to get me angry, thank you.	Say it, don't spray it.
I love you, boy.	You're not welcome.
Stop it now.	Ha, ha, you love a boy.
I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg.	Welcome, steady customer. I see you are ready for the Civil War reenactment.
Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come? In a Civil War reenactment we need lots of Indians to shoot.	Here you go.
Hi-Yo!	"I don't know which part of that sentence to correct first. But I cannot come. I work 22 hours a day, and then I go home to a wife who will not touch me. The Indian rope trick has become the Indian ""nope"" trick."
Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?	The Squishee Lady!
Grape.	Go ahead.
She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.	Hey, she called me handsome!
Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us.	Come on, guys. We're gonna be late.
C'mon Barney, if you're gonna be General Grant, you have to have a drink.	Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us.
One drink won't hurt.	Yeah, but I'm a recovering alcoholic, so...
Mm-hmm!	Hey, you're right. I was afraid it would start me drinking again, but it didn't.
This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!	The south will boogie again!
Don't worry. I'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. So cold... so cold...	This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!
Now, you just take the kids home. I've got to return this keg.	Oh the ny-lon has been released.
Why do you always take the side of local merchants?	Are you sure you can get your deposit back? It's in pretty bad shape.
Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof.	Why do you always take the side of local merchants?
Apu?	Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof.
That giggle is none of my business. Or is it?	Apu?
What's a eunuch?	Avert your eyes, eunuch!
"""Unique, unite..."""	What's a eunuch?
Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up inside.	Homie, what's wrong?
Let's go.	Apu is having an affair?!
I know, can you believe it? Oh, Manjula's just gonna die!	Let's go.
In my role as customer, I saw the whole thing.	How did you find out?
Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock.	No, no, no, let's just keep playing. What's the score?
Why don't you play this?	Here, guys.
He already knows. Let's tell Krusty.	We have to do something to save that marriage. Maybe I should just tell Manjula. Or you could talk to Apu...
That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.	What would that accomplish?
Apu is cheating!	That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.
I think he's building to something.	That's sad. All those kids.
...So anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--	I think he's building to something.
Okay, this isn't easy, so I'm just gonna come out and say it.	I know, I know, there will be forty-seven bottles of beer on the wall. Yes. Homer, you did not bring me here for this. What is it that you want to tell me?
Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash...	Here-here-here you go, mister.
I saw you and that Squishee Lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!	Is there something you want to tell me?
Yes. You are scum.	It's true. It only happened once, but I am so ashamed. I am scum.
Mmm, caramel baloney.	Oh, I always thought karma was baloney, but not anymore.
You might hear from your friends or co-workers that Apu isn't living at home anymore.	Kids, we want to talk to you about something.
You bet I am!	I just wish there was something we could do... Oh. Oh, Homer, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!	You can run, but you can't glide!
And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.	Tonight, we invite both Manjula and Apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming.
Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...	I keep telling you. Off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. But if we remind Apu and Manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems.
This is going great.	Even better.
Uh, we didn't order that.	Hey pally, uh... where do you want the Fudge Mahal?
Can I lick your fingers? Meet me at the mail slot.	Uh, we didn't order that.
It's where I got this!	I know a great nametag place. They do fabulous work.
Hey, Apu, I think she likes you.	Well, we had fun.
Whee! Whee!	Ooh, a challenge!
It's been on my list for a long time.	Wait a minute. This isn't on the list!
I bought the issue for Richard Avedon's pictures of Lenny.	Not bad, eh?
Woo!	Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?
It was magic. He took a Cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.	"""My Fair Lady,"" performed with all-octuplet cast... done."
Wait, wait. You forgot to eat a light bulb.	Apu, you have completed the list. You may now move back with your family and your never-ending disgrace.
Here you go. Don't worry. I soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.	Thank you very much, you big fat blabbermouth. I-- Sorry, sorry, it's been a rough month.
Well, hookers and Spiderman.	Who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
Are you okay, Lisa?	My little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
Aww, she must have dreamt about Hitler again.	Ich bin ein... gymnast!
...I GET KNOCKED DOWN / I GET KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN / YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOCK ME DOWN!	Well, Bart's kinda-- No!
Hey, where's my keg?	Whoa! Party house.
I TAKE A WHISKEY DRINK / I TAKE A CHOCOLATE DRINK / AND WHEN I HAVE TO PEE / I USE THE KITCHEN SINK / I SING THE SONG THAT REMINDS ME I'M A URINATING GUY!	Duh.
FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX!	I TAKE A WHISKEY DRINK / I TAKE A CHOCOLATE DRINK / AND WHEN I HAVE TO PEE / I USE THE KITCHEN SINK / I SING THE SONG THAT REMINDS ME I'M A URINATING GUY!
That's it, boy! It's time for your bath!	My bubble, my rules.
Now go to bed!	That's it, boy! It's time for your bath!
That is called parenting. I'm going to Moe's.	Now go to bed!
Good night, Bart.	Banana tree!
Good night, Lisa.	Good night, Bart.
Good night, Maggie.	Good night, Lisa.
Cherish these moments, Homer.	Good night, Maggie.
What the-- You earned how many credits without our permission?	I just wanted a place to sit down.
Against my wishes!	Doogie Howser went to college when he was my age.
Oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. But if a woman did it--	"I put those ""Cathys"" on the fridge for you. I don't even like them. They've gotten so smutty."
Oh, come on--	Homer, Cathy is a woman.
You're right.	Oh, come on--
I was trying to throw Bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree.	What are you doing?
Marge, where's my pellet gun?	I was trying to throw Bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree.
Right.	In the tree.
Oh no, not the good cheek!	Right.
Oh.	Oh no, not the good cheek!
Guys, I just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond.	Oh, I cannot listen to this again.
Certainly, Lenford. Make every day a celebration of your love. Surprise her with a pasta salad! Put a mini-beret on your wang!	Yeah, you must be some kind of marriage super-genius. How 'bout a few tips?
Hey, hey, hey, no peeking.	Oh, I can't wait to see my surprise!
Happy anniversary, Marge!	Hey, hey, hey, no peeking.
Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is a visit from kindly old Dr. Foot.	That caterpillar is screaming.
Fine, I won't kill it.	...which has chosen your yard as its home.
Finish the job.	Fine, I won't kill it.
Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?	"""Screamapillar Care Tips."" Wow, look at all this stuff. ""Without constant reassurance, it will die. It's sexually attracted to fire..."""
If he wants to sleep with us, forget it.	What does he want now?
Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.	Put him down, boy! Put him down!
Oh fine, I'll go back to the beginning.	Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.
Oh no, I crushed that horrible bug. What should I do?	Oh fine, I'll go back to the beginning.
Uh, he's sleeping.	Why don't I hear any screaming?
Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh...	Then why don't I hear any sleep-screams?
Lousy Community Service. Meals on wheels! Eat it up or I go to jail!	Whatever happened to... fair use!
Uh, they discontinued the cobbler.	Didn't these meals used to have a cobbler?
Now let's not get into who smells like what.	You smell like cobbler.
Safe and sound.	Oh, I can't let you leave now.
Please don't kill me! I won't tell anyone about the skeleton. And I could bring you more victims. Like Lenny! He'd go great with wild rice.	Thank God. I'm out of matches. Oh no, here's another one.
But what about the axe?	Oh, don't be such a nervous Purvis. That's not a real skeleton, it's a Halloween costume.
Eh, you're the shut-in.	Oh, I couldn't possibly eat all this. Please join me.
...so I threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp.	Eh, you're the shut-in.
Yeah, I've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking.	Oh Homer, I feel like I'm talking to Bennett Cerf.
My pleasure.	Before you go, would you mind opening this jar of butter pickles?
And I can ride my bike real fast.	Oh my, you're as strong as you are handsome.
Hey, I'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- Oh-ho-ho, you mean me? I'd be delighted.	Can I call you the next time I need a muscular he-man?
Y'ello! Hi, Mrs. Bellamy. No, I'm not doing anything. I can mow your lawn.	Hey, I'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- Oh-ho-ho, you mean me? I'd be delighted.
Cover for me.	Y'ello! Hi, Mrs. Bellamy. No, I'm not doing anything. I can mow your lawn.
Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. They put spells on you!	That woman is taking advantage of you, and we need you to do things around here. The oven light is out and you never finished filling up the aquarium.
Laxative?	Freshen your drinks, ladies?
The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.	I am so sick of doing her dirty work. She's taking advantage of us, Homer.
Are you all right?	She's got a set of lungs on her.
Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--	That man took my diamond necklace.
O-kay.	Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.	Oh my gosh, she's dead.
Without a trace.	"So let me get this straight. This mysterious ""man with braces"" just stabbed the old lady and disappeared?"
Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our point of view. Financially.	I found her will, Chief. It was just changed to leave the Simpsons fifty thousand dollars.
Now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... DOES THAT EVER WORK?	No!
Book 'im, Lou.	No, nah, it never does.
You'd be dead a million times.	Yeah, if Dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?
Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer.	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... Yeah, that's better.
I'd stab somebody for a pickle.	Right away, sir. I-I-I don't want no trouble.
Gimme some peanuts.	I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.	Up-bup-bup. You didn't say you'd kill me.
What? It goes right by our house.	Homer!
Here's my underwear drawer.	I insist on searching every inch of this home personally.
You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you.	Oh Homer, what are we going to do?
Don't worry, Marge. I'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. I know who stopped up the toilet!	I can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.	But we're innocent! It was the man with the braces.
Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!	I'm also your host. Now let's meet a ghost!
Y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side...	Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!
Just think of them as twinkling stars.	It's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.	Homie, I'm sorry. I can't. I just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. The kids growing up, grandchildren...
Now you do it for me.	My love. You saved my life.
Goodbye, Marge.	Thank you.
What?!	"You're on ""Frame-Up""!"
I knew it!	Only me, Carmen Electra!
This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry.	"""Frame Up"" is Fox's latest hit! Right after ""No Pants Island"" and ""Fart Date."""
Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings.	We were in the Green Room. I had so much shrimp!
I've made my choice.	Uh Homer, my face is up here.
So hot, so sticky...	Hey hey! Hey...
Marge?!	So hot, so sticky...
Lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!	Dad, no. We're trying to conserve energy.
Jingle bell what?	JINGLE BELL, JINGLE BELL, JINGLE BELL RO...
A blackout?! Every time Santa and I get together it's a disaster.	Dad, it's a blackout.
Oh, no! They're stealing the tire fire!	When's my right time, Kent? When's my right time?
No.	Look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... They're living my dream, and you won't let me join them. Please can I throw one little...
No.	What if I just burn down a...
No! I've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that Santa Claus. No more irresponsible behavior.	Can't I at least incite further...
All right, but not the imported.	Can I have a beer?
You've got to set limits, Marge.	All right, but not the imported.
Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.	I don't care what they say. I won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock.	Dad...
I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this.	Homer, this is all your fault. If you hadn't plugged in your dancing Santa, none of this would have happened.
Wrong answer.	I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this.
Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?	Mom, Dad, someone stole my Malibu Stacy collection!
See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I love this kid.	Oh, forget it. They couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing.
Interesting. All right, I've come up with a composite sketch of my prime suspect.	See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I love this kid.
Exactly.	Dad, that's Bart.
Look at him over there, eating that apple. What's he planning? What?!	Exactly.
You're right. What's this?	Maybe we should look for clues.
A cap!	You're right. What's this?
"From ""The Woolly Bully."""	A cap!
Do you sell hats?	"From ""The Woolly Bully."""
To people?	Yeah.
People with heads?	Maybe.
Did you steal dolls from my daughter?	Dude... I need a new cap.
Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie.	I think they demean women.
Good, 'cause I need directions.	But I just got out of juvie.
Aw...	Well, you'll be happy to know Malibu Stacey's fine. I really appreciate what you did, Dad.
Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And I felt like a big man pushing that kid around.	You said you'd do something, and you followed through on it.
Cheese!	Oh, that's it.
Oh, well... Heh, heh. Hm... oh, I'll... no....	Homer, you are so brave. If anyone deserves to take a penny, it is you.
You know, I've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation Krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, Mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the Mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, Smithers, Poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, Kwik-E-Mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. But protecting Springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all.	Come on, come on. There's only one in there.
Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people.	If you like protecting people, you could make that your job. You know, start a security company.
Fellas, I'm starting my own private police force. Will you join me?	Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people.
How 'bout Lenny?	Well, who would my partner be?
You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.	No way!
Flanders, I was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers.	You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.
Who said it was a he?	Well, nice work, Inspector Find-It. Did you catch the thief?
Who said you did?	Well, I sure didn't.
You're pushing your luck, pal.	Okely-dokely.
Ooh, ooh! Here's my commercial!	You're pushing your luck, pal.
Is this you? If it is, don't dial nine one one. Simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two.	A monster!
Have no fear, SpringShield's present!	Help me, SpringShield!
The only friend you need is SpringShield.	Friend?
You know, the old lady's apartment was actually Lenny's. We just used a different duvet cover.	That commercial is very effective.
Green vegetables and homework.	Hey officer Homer, how'd you get so big and strong?
Even dessert?	Homie, to honor Springfield's newest hero, I made you your favorite dinner. All three courses are dessert.
Woo hoo! I'm Chief of Police.	And in my blind rage, I hereby turn over all this town's police duties to Homer Simpson and SpringShield.
Now that I am the law, I'm gonna make a lot of changes around here. First, I'm gonna cut overhead by freeing Otis, the lovable town drunk.	Oh, wait. It was better the other way.
What a character.	You can let me go, but I'll just keep exposing myself at the mall.
Well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth.	Dad, make him stop!
All right, Fat Tony. Your little game is over.	"Hurry up, boys. We gotta get these ""toy poodles"" to the pet shop."
If that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, I love this song.	Radar Love.
I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT, HAND'S WET ON THE WHEEL... THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT DRIVES MY HEEL... IT'S MY BABY CALLIN' ON THE TELEPHONE... I GOT SOME PIZZA AND I'M BRINGIN' IT HOME...	If that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, I love this song.
You all know me. I've kept the streets safe for you and your children. I've tricked or treated at many of your houses. Last year I was Jar Jar Binks. Now, who will stand and fight with me?	I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT, HAND'S WET ON THE WHEEL... THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT DRIVES MY HEEL... IT'S MY BABY CALLIN' ON THE TELEPHONE... I GOT SOME PIZZA AND I'M BRINGIN' IT HOME...
Shut up, Flanders. Anyone else? What about you, Dr. Hibbert?	I'm with you, Homer.
After everything I did you're going to abandon me?	Sorry Homer. I'm a coward now, like all recovering alcoholics.
What, and let them come after you and the kids?	Homie, please. Why don't you just leave town?
In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?	We could come with you.
I need you guys to help me. Why'd you lock yourselves in?	In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
I don't get it. I finally did a job where I wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now I'm gonna get killed for it.	You are listing my broken dreams.
Yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. And if you kill him, someone'll take his place. And that's pretty much the end of it. The town'll be yours.	Any last words, Simpson?
Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. I'm giving this badge to the next guy I see.	Oh Homie, I'm so glad you're alive!
I must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.	Well then, who shot all the gangsters?
Aw, she's taking a nap.	Hm. Time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
She's just like Clark Kent. When there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. Nighty-night, sweetie.	Yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot Mr. Burns.
Oh, I'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now I have to sleep them off.	My favorite is number three!
Were they now?	Those were for the church breakfast.
The hammock man! I'm glad he's a little early today.	Get your hammocks!
You had me at comfort.	The price is ten dollars, but I MUST warn you, this is no ordinary hammock. Its webbing is a mesh of comfort... and evil.
Mr. Hammock, say hello to Madam Ass.	You had me at comfort.
What the...? It made another me! How cool is that?	Mr. Hammock, say hello to Madam Ass.
Hm, no belly-button.	What the...? It made another me! How cool is that?
Shuttle's in the hangar!	Hm, no belly-button.
You wanna be my slave?	Shuttle's in the hangar!
I'm gonna need help with this.	Eh, he had a good run.
Hm...	I'm gonna need help with this.
No, you've got chores to do.	Beer... for me?
Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed to find a... wait a minute.	Chores? Me need clone.
Wow, four of me. I think this could be a magic hammock. And it just might be the answer to my problems.	Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed to find a... wait a minute.
Uh-huh!	Nuh-uh.
Man, are we evenly matched.	Why you little...
I mean, four!	But of course.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!	Yay!
Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card.	Say Homer, I was, uh, I was wondering if I could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me.
Ned...	No problem! Discover okay?
Twenty-three. Now, today I'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart and girl it up with Lisa.	Homie, I must say you have the energy of twenty men lately.
Now before I abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?	Ohh, I gotta get rid of these guys.
Anybody else?	I do!
Anybody else? Come on...	Anybody else?
Okay, everyone out!	Anybody else? Come on...
You'd think so, but no.	Dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?
Yeah, it's a good group.	"They look like you, they were rude to Patty and Selma, and the horde has been described as ""very gassy."""
Noooo!	Good God, we're doomed!
We're out of donuts!	Noooo!
Good news.	The horde is almost dead! There's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning.
Not Mr. Blasty?	...Twenty eight, twenty nine... There's one missing.
It's okay, boy. You'll be shooting angels in heaven.	Not Mr. Blasty?
Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break.	PLEASE DON'T HURT OUR FAMILY.
Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --	I very much doubt that, Homer. These are horrible ghouls from the past.
Gimme!	Pardon the grabbing, but I've perfected a device that could save us all... a time machine. We can go back to the past and save our guns.
Hear me, people of the past!	...poor William Bonney might have become a doctor, or a Senator...
I come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. Grab your guns and follow me!	Hey everyone, that's us!
Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!	Dad, what are you doing?
Hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?	"Tell me again why we're spending our vacation on ""The Island of Lost Souls""?"
Hey, I've been around Scotsmen.	Now he may try to slobber on your crotch.
Hey, I'm on vacation.	Homer, someone's in trouble!
You mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?	Homie, something very creepy is going on here.
Bring back some ice.	I think I'm going to do a little sleuthing.
And I've never seen you use your tail like that.	Marge, you were like a wild beast. So voracious and prowly.
Oh my God! She's become a monster! Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected during the sex.	And I've never seen you use your tail like that.
Gotta find a way to change Marge back. And replace the M&Ms I took from the mini bar.	Oh my God! She's become a monster! Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected during the sex.
Flanders?! A perfect vacation ruined.	Hey, Homer!
Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned.	Hate to be a needy Neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?
Fine.	Oh, c'mon Homer. All I'm asking is for you to yank my teats and harvest my milk.
You know, you're not helping.	Oooh, that's nice. You're actually quite gentle when you want to be.
IN THE JUNGLE, THE CREEPY JUNGLE / HOMER RIDES A FREAK...	You know, you're not helping.
What's that?	Shhh. Hey.
I can't believe it. Hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!	Oooh, a toenail!
Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...	Hey Dad, check it out!
Maggie!	Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...
Lisa!	Maggie!
What game?	We were just playing.
Manimals, invertebroads! You must fight back against the one who did this to you!	Let's eat Maggie.
You guys are nuts. All you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do I sign up?	Wait'll Moe sees how wasted I got without him. He's gonna plotz.
Hi, Moe, got any beer?	Makes you think.
What the-- Where's my money?	Wait a minute. I'm at work. Ya gotta pay for it.
So you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.	Sorry, Homer.
And you can live with that.	I'm afraid so.
Fine. There are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.	Yuh-huh.
Oh, yeah.	Fine. There are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
Lick 'em. Go away.	Are you gonna buy those toads or just lick 'em?
Jewish? Oh, no, I'm not Jewish.	Thanks for the donation, Mr. Simpson. Do you feel okay?
Well, Moe...	Yeah, I guess I got caught up in all the glitz and glamour.
Oh.	Homer, I'm so sorry. Have a free beer.
Ah, I don't care about the color of your skin, Lenny. You're my friend!	Oh.
Oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya...	Homer, can you say the alphabet backwards?
I've had just about enough of you.	Hey, I'm worried.
I'm outta here...	Ah, rats.
Hey, you want my keys?	Get his keys!
Get 'em now, jerks.	Hey, you want my keys?
So long, jerks.	Get 'em now, jerks.
Running after the car, huh? Let's see if you can follow this.	So long, jerks.
Moe's Tavern.	Where to, Pal?
Good morning, everybody! What's for breakfast, cutie?	Moe's Tavern.
What? Wait a... That can't be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?	Homie, it's five p.m. We're having dinner.
If I was that drunk, I would remember it.	No, it was the night you got loaded at Moe's and the car had to be towed home.
Couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?	It's true. I couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. I had to tell Mr. Burns you had violent diarrhea.
Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail.	Do you remember how you got home last night, Dad?
Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?	There's no light rail in Springfield.
And that's why you're my favorite.	I will, Dad.
All right, time for my favorite show.	And that's why you're my favorite.
I don't remember anybody telling me I was gonna be on TV.	Another proud moment for the Simpsons.
Yeah, I'm pretty great...	Oh, you big fooler. Pretending not to remember so you could surprise us.
That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?	I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know...
"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this."	So whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye...
Lousy family...	"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this."
A hot babe...	So I'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart. What I was trying to say, and maybe I didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go...	Have you always resented us, Dad?
Oh, what have I done?	Sorry we ruined your life, Homer.
Hey, what's this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?	Get in.
You can't just leave me out here! There's not another woman for miles!	Get out of the car, Homer.
"""The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!!"" But I thought you guys were mad at me. For once in my life, I'm confused."	Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!
Damn straight.	We had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point.
You what?	And even though you knew I ratted you out to the IRS, you never busted me on it.
You guys are the best. I love you, I love you, I love you...	So to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. Do you like it?
I'm okay. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you...	You guys are the best. I love you, I love you, I love you...
Hey, what gives? Where are all the rock stars?	I'm okay. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you...
What was that?	I don't know, but it's starting to get dark.
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! It's Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...	How ya doin'?
Woo! STD's!	Welcome to Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, where you'll experience the complete rock 'n' roll lifestyle, without the lawsuits and STD's.
To rock!	Now you're all here for one reason...
I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!	Have you been awake all night?
"Uh-huh. Now I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool? I thought he'd be all like, ""I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?"" But he's just like you or me or Jesus over there."	You took pills you found on the floor?
Out of my way, Nerdlinger.	Come on, who'd like to be a bass player?
Here you go.	My image!
Ooh, I'm telling Mr. Jagger.	I'm telling Mr. Jagger.
Like this, Mr. Kravitz?	The clothes you wear on stage should be a defiant statement of individuality.
Mr. Seltzer?	Fire! / Yes! / All right! Fire! / Hey!
No, I think it's Seltzer.	Setzer.
I came up with a stage move I feel is very cool.	What is it, Homer?
Baby, baby, baby, baby!	I came up with a stage move I feel is very cool.
Sorry Mick!	We've gotta start using a cheaper oatmeal.
I'M SO HOT FOR ME, I'M SO HOT FOR ME / I'M SO COLD...	Look everyone, Homer's got it.
Bor-ing.	Lyrics are the hardest part of songwriting. But when you come up with something meaningful and heartfelt...
But rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.	Will you stop saying that?
Precisely.	You just want mindless generic rock?
I got 'em!	Paparazzi to the left!
I'm entitled to a private life! I'm not a role model! And so forth.	I got 'em!
We know!	They're bloody cardboard!
Really? You really think I'm better than you?	Uh, you rock, Homer.
What the hell are you doing here?	That was great, Homie.
It's been a week already?	Camp is over, Homer.
Wait, don't go! I wanna keep on rockin'. C'mon guys... a-one, a-two...	Let's rock 'n' roll...
Noooo!!	I'll take that.
No! No, I won't go! You can't make me!	Come... on... Dad...
I knew nothing!	Dad, you knew this day was coming.
Never!	Stop kicking me, Dad!
My dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. I was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. I'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing.	Never!
I'm so despondent.	No, I'm fine.
But I like it...	Cheer up, Homer. It's only rock 'n' roll camp.
For serious?	Tell you what. We're doing a benefit gig before we leave town. How would you like to join us on stage?
Can I have forty guest passes?	For serious, Homer.
Woo hoo!	Can I have forty guest passes?
Wow, All-Access. All-Access...	Woo hoo!
Good thing it's laminated.	Wow, All-Access. All-Access...
All-access.	Sir, you can't...
And after the show, you can come backstage for pizza and pop.	Wow Homer, I ain't had front row seats since my Moonie wedding.
Oops, gotta run. Enjoy the show.	I'm so proud of you, Homie. It's like you're Kid Rock and I'm Pamela Anderson Lee Rock.
Evening, fellow rockers.	Lenny, don't you have a crotch to stuff?
I'm ready. Just give me a guitar. How many solos should I do? Four?	There you are. We thought we were going to have to go on without you.
I'll do four.	I'm ready. Just give me a guitar. How many solos should I do? Four?
My official tour jacket!	Uh, Homer, you didn't think you were gonna be playing with--
"Look at-- Wait, they misspelled ""Guitar Hero."""	My official tour jacket!
Can't you do it?	"Look, sorry if there's been a misunderstanding, Homer. We really just need you to tap the mics and say ""test, test."""
Oh. Okay. So I'll, uh... okay.	Can't you do it?
Test, test...	"I'm his groupie! Am I saying that right, ""groupie?"""
Test, test. Check, check.	"Why is he performing the duties of a roadie? Am I saying that right, ""roadie?"""
"Test... ""TEST TEST, YOU'RE TESTIN' MY LOVE FOR YOU, CHECK CHECK, YOU'RE CHECKIN' TO SEE IF I'M TRUE..."""	Hey, he's not rocking out at all.
BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY... Uh-oh.	Not on my shift.
Oh, yeah... When you've been in as many as I have, you can sense them coming.	Did you know it was going to turn into a riot, Dad?
What am I, the lost and found?	Did they ever find Tom Petty's toe?
There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail.	No, sorry.
Well, you're very sweet, Mick, but the only rocking I want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family.	We're doing a gig tomorrow to benefit the victims of tonight's gig, and we'd consider it an honor if you'd join us.
Nah, I've got something to remember 'em by.	Are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, Dad?
Have fun at school, kids.	Nah, I've got something to remember 'em by.
Rock and Roll! Woo hoo!	Mr. Simpson, this zone is for school buses only.
I hate reality shows...	...and we saw a dramatic collapse in the lion-gazelle alliance.
I've grown, you haven't.	A year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
Stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. Nice going, geniuses.	Networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.
Marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children.	Get back, honky cat! Those systems are too expensive.
Come on, kids. Daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk.	Marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children.
Woo hoo!	"And the winner by a nose is ""No Risk""!"
No problem.	Okay, now all we have to do is install your satellite dish. Can you be home from eight AM Monday morning, through June?
Hey, Flanders -- check out my new satellite dish!	No problem.
I bet you would.	Boy, that's Jim Dandy roof candy! I'd love to come over some time and watch that Church Channel.
Damn your sparkling wordplay!	"Oh, you'd win that bet. Seems like I'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. Or as I like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
Mmm... feed...	Cool! It's the NBC news feed!
Kids, kids, you're both right.	It's Wednesday night!
Put pie here.	Why don't you turn off the TV and join us for dessert? I made a pie.
Me not pig.	Would you like some ice cream with that?
Homicidal robots... so like us.	Sucker.
They're gonna be in the same class as each other?	What? I've gotta be in the same class as him?
An old army buddy is visiting Mannix?	They're gonna be in the same class as each other?
The status quo.	"""To Fraternal Love""."
"Hey, you can't fool us. We're from the ""Learn to Fart"" state."	Got it.
Well, what about Bart?	I'm so sorry. Lisa's a very special little girl, and we'll spare no expense in finding her.
This is where the kids were last seen.	Yeah, funny story. One day, I was really bored. And Dad had left the steam roller idling in the driveway...
Well, he's not gonna get very far without that.	The plastic casing from the tip of Bart's shoelace! A mother knows!
Bart, is that you?	Well, he's not gonna get very far without that.
And Maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing Bart and Lisa.	Oh my special little guys. You're okay, you're okay!
Dew-ey! Dew-ey! Dew-ey!	November 1948. Americans pick their President. Victory seems certain for Governor Thomas E. Dewey...
Woo hoo! I win the bet! Who's your Daddy?	"The headlines proclaim ""Dewey Defeats Truman."""
Not if I can stop that inauguration!	Harry Truman triumphs by two million votes.
Let's hear it.	I win, Dad. That means I get to choose today's father-daughter activity!
You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself.	We're building homes for the homeless.
Domiciles for the Destitute? Is this that thing that Jimmy Carter does?	You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself.
"Well, if Bart can be ""El Barto""..."	Dad, what is that?
Oh, thanks...	Oh. If only I had your courage, Señor.
Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?	Dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring.
My real ring's inside a turtle.	This is a Band-Aid wrapped in tin foil.
Can I help you?	Well, he's not much to look at...but he is a good father...Hel-lo, ring tan line! He's new on the market!
... And that's how my beautiful wife brought our son Bart into the world.	Well, I've read enough articles about flirting to know it when I see it.
Sure, why not?	Ah, Homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?
Hey, why would I want Purina when I've got Fancy Feast right here?	Sometimes I worry you might think about other women.
Aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. Well...	That doesn't sound very convincing.
Did you label the meals so I can tell which is which?	Not feeling well. Going to bed. Dinner and breakfast are on the table.
Well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. Goodnight!	Help, I can't get out!
Hey, gimme some of those blankets.	Well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. Goodnight!
Explain later!	Homer, let me explain something--
I fell off. Hee hee hee.	Homie! Oooo, Homie... Hey, what happened?
Yeah, he truly is a monster. Hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. Just you, me, the kids and the twins. Whadaya say?	Now, don't get too used to these. That awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days.
Well, that cinches it. Lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response.	Whatever Bart is saying is a lie. Mom! What happened? Your endowment's bigger than Harvard's.
That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song.	Mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?
YOU TOOK A TWENTY-KARAT DIAMOND, AND MADE IT GLEAM / LIKE A BIG SPAGHETTI DINNER, SMOTHERED IN WHIPPED CREAM.	That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song.
AND THEY'RE ALL MINE...	HOORAY!
Uh... I was gettin' around to it.	Homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?
Forget it Kiki. You're not putting your brain into her body.	Kiki Highsmith, Highsmith Modeling. Honey, I like your look.
No dice. Take your fun and adventure outside.	That's not why I'm here. I can offer your wife a lot of modeling work. Trade shows to start, then who knows?
Wait for what? Confirmation of my attitude?	No dice. Take your fun and adventure outside.
Shut up, boy.	I GOT KRUSTY IN HOT WATER / NOW I'VE GOT TO HELP HIM OUT / DA DA DA...
With the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup.	Oh, I don't get a song? Mom got a song.
Gentlemen, say hello to Springfield's newest supermodel!	And now, one of OvMittCon's Faces to Watch 2003, rookie spokesmodel Marge Simpson!
I'm on it.	Dad, look!
Do you have anything with ground-up whale in it?	Hey, that's it. Mogumbo!
I came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'Cause I already showered once today.	Do you have anything with ground-up whale in it?
Kids, I'd like to reintroduce you to classic Marge.	Lisa learned a lesson! Lisa learned a lesson!
Not at all, sweetie. At least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one.	I finally feel like me again. You're not disappointed, are you?
Oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling.	Anyway, you're the only man I want ogling me.
Let's go get fried chicken!	Oh, Homie.
D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...	WHO LET HER JUGS OUT...?
D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...	MARGE LET HER JUGS OUT...
D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...	WHO LET HER JUGS OUT...?
Woo hoo! I got skybox tickets! And with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. Life is...	Yes, if he's smart, he'll hold out for millions.
Check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. If you can call that hockey.	Mm... that takes me back.
Why can't they just be happy for my success?	Heads up, Dad. Here comes the scum!
Fine, watch your stupid Eagles concert.	This is a joke. You'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood.
Whatever.	It's a hockey game!
Because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.	This sucks. How come Lisa gets something and I don't?
Hm. Better add some more nails.	Your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
Perfect.	Hm. Better add some more nails.
Hey, get out, I'm in here! Oh.	Bart! Watch your potty mouth!
I go by how funny the sign is.	Why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.	But where will we live?
Eh, that was boring. Let's get a hotel.	Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.
Stupid Bran Producer's Convention.	Sorry, folks. Every hotel room in town is booked.
I know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, Lenny.	I do not want another lecture from a German backpacker about how we don't appreciate the national park system.
That's Lenny? Oh, I wanted the black one.	Hey, Simpsons.
So how do you afford such a sweet pad?	Wow, Lenny. Your apartment is stunning.
Who wants to eat a loser?	Come on, guys, you gotta stay. Tonight's the big cock fight. Ah-- We can eat the loser...
1895, forget it. We'd be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy.	Oh yeah, the gimmick is, it's a house from 1895. And you gotta do everything like they did back then.
It's not a time machine, Moe.	You could save McKinley.
Marge, I'm still not sure about this.	It's not a time machine, Moe.
I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!	I like what I'm seeing in there.
Where's that kid with my latte?!	They go to pieces over nothing. They're perfect for reality TV.
He's not coming, is he? Is he?	Where's that kid with my latte?!
Oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, Lisa.	Oh man, I can't wear this. I look like Buster Brown, whoever that is.
Wow, they had an army helmet under every bed!	Yeah, those golden curls are to die for.
Befoul an army helmet? You'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?	Squiggy?
Finally, I'm no longer a slave to the Gillette Corporation.	Hey, you should see how much trouble Dad's having shaving with a straight razor.
Why, it says here that President Cleveland has...	Finally, I'm no longer a slave to the Gillette Corporation.
Okay, more coal, less coal, less, less, more, less-less-less! Annnd... none.	Why, it says here that President Cleveland has...
Perfect.	Okay, more coal, less coal, less, less, more, less-less-less! Annnd... none.
You know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and Maggie's in her cage...	Twenty-three skidoo!
Maybe I could wuther your heights?	You know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and Maggie's in her cage...
All right, let's take that...	Well, okay. Blow out that lamp and I'll take off my Victorian undergarments.
This comes off.	If you just...
All right, let's see what we've got here.	No!
You've been in there over an hour, boy! Other people have to confess too, you know. Oh, I can't hold it in. I hate this house!	They're gay, I get it.
Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!	Yeah, I can't wait to see which one of 'em dies first.
Oh, I wish you would reconsider the proposal of Hiram Beatwife.	With all this hard work, I'm too tired to worry about the world. And soon I will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!
Marge, I'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled.	Hello, Laverne...
Marge! Throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!	I guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
"You monsters! You've turned this show into a ""Survivor"" clone."	This rope was woven from handlebar mustaches.
"I would never sign that! Unless there was a red sticker that said ""sign here."""	Mr. Simpson, your contract allows us to do anything we want to you.
Where do you get those things anyway?	Uh-huh, that's what we used.
Our lives are ruined!	Oh no, everything's ruined. Our good bellows... our stereopticon... Squiggy! Homer, your strop! Your strop!
I can't remember the last time I cried like this.	We're not allowed to interfere with the reality of the show, which reminds me... Burn the leftovers! Leave nothing!
Oh, yes! The tag chafed my throat! Let's go eat some bugs.	When you put your T-shirt on backwards?
Savages! I'll handle this, Marge.	Psst! Psst!
We come in peace. We takem your land.	Savages! I'll handle this, Marge.
Wow. Marge, I think I figured out their primitive language!	But now we're going to escape. We're going to overpower your crew and return to civilization.
And now to wreck their precious helicopter.	And yet I've learned nothing.
Yeah, but... okay... Oh...	No, Homer, no! That's our only way home!
That Lenny sure had a crazy apartment.	Yeah, but... okay... Oh...
No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.	Oh, it sure is good to be home.
That's it! TV was the one good thing in my life and now I can't enjoy it any more.	I think I'm gonna be sick.
If we formed a club we could serve drinks.	Yeah. If we read books we could form a club.
Good idea, Lisa.	Hey Dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?
Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is.	Good idea, Lisa.
Hm, off again. Maybe I can hear what's going on.	Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is.
So, this has become a game of wits, has it?	Hm, off again. Maybe I can hear what's going on.
Perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.	So, this has become a game of wits, has it?
Mail call!	No one will ever know.
"The ""George Foreman Mail Sorter"" will let us know."	Anything good?
Your family is invited to a free weekend at Stagnant Springs Spa.	"The ""George Foreman Mail Sorter"" will let us know."
Don't struggle. You'll only sink faster.	Help, please! Someone throw me a stick!
Do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.	"Ha, ha, ha. Go ahead, look. The whole world already saw it in ""Nudist Camp Commandant."" I wore nothing!"
Wait a minute, I'm not wearing a shirt!	Do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.
Mmm, steamed Gentile.	Who ordered the steamed Gentile?
Triple, no. Definitely no.	Don't worry, us pigs will catch this killer. Now Mr. Simpson, is it possible you're living a double or triple life that your wife doesn't know about?
Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!	Now I will need round-the-clock access to all the Simpsons, especially Bart.
You'll understand someday when you have kids.	Dad, I can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own.
Wow, you don't even have to point it at him.	Fair enough. But now that we know what it can do, there's no need to... Mother F...!
Hmm... Well, there's Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, The Emperor of Japan, ex-President Bush.	Homer, think carefully. Of all the people you have known, who might have reason to do you ill?
PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick...	The late Frank Grimes...
I'm a people person. Who drinks.	How can one ordinary man have so many enemies?
Gotcha.	Homer, in order to identify your assailant, I must follow you through the course of a normal day. Just do what you usually do and the killer will reveal himself.
I just wanted to impress you.	This is a normal day?
Mardi Gras, eh? Didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?	Welcome to your Springfield Mardi Gras headquarters. Cast your vote now for this year's king!
Uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, I'd like to buy a copy of Jugs and Ammo.	Our time is passing, old friend.
Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts.	Well, we've settled that argument. You can't read a magazine and drive.
Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench.	But your car was built in Croatia. It's made from old Soviet tanks.
Right, right. I'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. There's two!	Homer please, the last thing you need is more enemies.
You're so smart. Shock him.	The trap is set. The killer will think this dummy is you, out for an evening stroll. Now we lie in wait, like hungry Cassius for noble Caesar.
Moe! He's got a dark side I've never dreamed of.	Now who's the sociopath? Huh?
Once I kill you everyone will think I'm the real Homer!	Thank you, Lord.
Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.	I'd just come up behind him with a knife and slit his throat real quick-like.
Oh my God! He's getting closer!	Homer, if I could write Haikus while skinheads beat me with soap, I can concentrate anywhere.
Very well. I am gone!	Listen Homer, I don't know who your killer is, but I do know he'll strike again. Your only hope is to stay completely out of sight.
Don't look at me!	Very well. I am gone!
Right here.	Homer Simpson?
Woo hoo! Good things do happen to bad people!	You've been elected King of Mardi Gras!
Marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen.	Honey, the king of Mardi Gras has to ride around on a float all day. You'll be a sitting duck.
Nonetheless, the people have spoken.	Homer, it's a trap. You only won because somebody stuffed the ballot box with these.
Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday.	But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.
But I'm not drunk!	Today's Tuesday and you've had six beers.
Now Bob, I know you're concerned, but don't worry. I have operatives working the crowd.	The killer is out there. I would stake my entire fortune of cigarettes on it.
America loves its Kings, from George the third to Larry.	Whoa, I'm so drunk I'm gonna puke. You ever get that feeling, beautiful?
Oh my God! Attention drunken idiots: this is your king! Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!	Homer, you must get off that float! The brake line has been cut!
They're not for dudes!	Hey, how 'bout some beads?
You saved my life!	I did it!
Don't be so sure. I've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.	I've saved a life... and it feels wonderful. And yet, I could just as easily drop you to your death.
We're up so high. Where could that shot have come from?	Everything going dark... like Duff Stout, the beer that made Ireland famous. I love you, Doris! I...
Well, duh.	There's your killer!
Your king needs these stilts!	Well, duh.
Not anymore!	Jesus is our only King.
Hey, I know you. You're my mechanic, Junior.	There he is!
Frank Grimes...	Frank Grimes, Junior.
Frank Grimes...	Don't you remember? Your ape-like incompetence drove my father insane.
Oh yeah. How is old Grimey?	"What's this? ""Extremely High Voltage"". Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp--"
Whoa, wait. Frank Grimes wasn't married. How could he have a son?	He's dead, like you should be!
We know. Frank Grimes, Jr.	Dad! I figured it out! The murderer is...
Yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. Goodnight, son.	Dad, I'm really glad you're still alive.
Bart! Turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!	THE VERY REASON THAT I LIVE / IS PLOTTING HOW TO WATCH HIM DIE...
Goodnight, sleepyhead. Do you have to poop?	But I'm not tired!
You know what made me feel better about myself? That award I got for World's Greatest Dad.	Hey, I only hung out with Krabappel because Skinner blew her off. I've never seen her so sad.
Which I did.	And you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
Mm... trophy.	Which I did.
Disney World?	Nope.
Gator Gulch?	Sorry, Grampa.
Wait a minute... I know where we're going... Oh, it's horrible...	Grampa, you're not even going.
It's even boring to fly over it!	Wait a minute... I know where we're going... Oh, it's horrible...
Oh, God!	It's even boring to fly over it!
Let's go make some fireworks of our own.	Ewww.
I wouldn't have it any other way.	I get to tamp the powder!
"Hey Skinner! Do you and Edna want to join Marge and me at ""Great Moments With Mr. Eisner""?"	This woman carried me for nine and a half months. I was out for two weeks, then went back in.
Oh, you mean the Enron ride. Let's go.	I believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.
Who will take home The Rampy?	So many categories... Gym teacher of the year, Substitute teacher of the year, Most Wheelchair-Accessible School Award?
Purple Rain!	"I love teachers. In fact, I'm a teacher. I taught Paul McCartney to go ""Whoo!"""
Michael Jackson just told me to shut up!	Shut up!
What a rip! You all should be ashamed!	Julio Estudiante...an inner-city math teacher who taught teenage gang members that differential equations are more powerful than bullets.
Well, here's ours. We're going to Disney World!	I love happy endings.
Oh, it's so beautiful.	Step away from the wall. Step away from the wall.
One churro, please.	Oh, it's so beautiful.
Here!	That'll be fourteen dollars.
Lisa, nobody likes a shill.	Mom, Dad, my birthday's coming up, and GirlTech Turbo Diaries are in stores now.
I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary.	Just buy me the friggin' toy.
Oh-my-God-oh-my-God-oh-my-God.	I agree -- a girl should have her own private diary. I had to share mine with my uncle.
Watch and learn.	Dad, you can't eat all those free samples. We've got to get Lisa's present.
More free samples.	Watch and learn.
Eh, it's still better than Indian food.	Dad, you ate all the free samples. Now you're eating men's slacks.
One Turbo Diary, please.	Eh, it's still better than Indian food.
Now what am I gonna get Lisa?	Unauthorized user! Access denied!
Lisa's not gonna want that. Oh, what can I get her?	I wonder what mommy's medicine tastes like!
What are you buying? Jerk stuff?	"Shop o' the mornin', Homer! Just call me ""Mall"" Flanders."
Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!	Sounds like fun! Let's party!
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.	I wonder what this could be?
Well, yes and no.	Could it be some kind of book?
Mostly no.	Well, yes and no.
But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson.	You were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.	I don't like McNuggets, I'm a vegetarian!
Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!	Dad! That information is all wrong! Maggie's a baby, not my best friend! You don't know anything about me!
Oh, what have I done? Children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?	Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!
Oh, Lisa's still mad at me.	I don't think so.
I did it for the insurance money.	I'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne?	I did it for the insurance money.
But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?!	Dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. It's too late.
Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her.	Yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart.
Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?	He found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. Turns out I have severe schizophrenia.
Drunk cop? Is that you?	Oh, God.
Ooh, pie.	No, look lower.
My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help.	What can I do for you?
How did you know?	Let me guess. It's about a girl.
Priceless.	It's always a dame. Usually with gams that don't quit. Till they get to the shoes. And then they're only napping.
I need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think I'm a good Dad.	Priceless.
Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL.	Okay, I'll get a line on your kid. I charge fifty bucks a day. Plus expenses.
It's one word.	Chunky... lover... 53?
Chunkylover53.	One word.
Dot com.	At AOL.
Ah, the information I've been waiting for.	Someone's already worked this guy over.
You should know. It is your favorite album.	"Is that Miles Davis' ""Birth of The Cool?"""
Wait, wait!	So you know one thing about me. Big deal.
I thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.	Wait, wait!
On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!	Well, maybe.
So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious.	And look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father.	Dad, today was so great. The animal rights protest, a visit to the Museum of Sadness and Oppression...
Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?	How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you?
"Uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""	What report?
That's right, honey.	"You read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself?"
You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses.	That's right, honey.
Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars?	I believe there's still the matter of my expenses.
A forty dollar steak?!	It's itemized.
You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?	Yeah, but if I'd eaten the whole thing, it would've been free.
I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.	Early on I was working under the theory that your daughter was a werewolf. It didn't pan out.
You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!	You'll regret the day you crossed Dexter Colt.
Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...	I was framed! You believe me, don't you Dad?
... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. Yes.	Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...
I look just like Elvis!	Blackening our hair was a great idea, Dad. I look just like a Powerpuff Girl.
Uh, Rock Strongo.	Lady Penelope Ariel-Ponyweather.
Uh, Lance Uppercut.	Your real name?
Let me just put on my glasses.	Thank you. Sign here, Mr. Uppercut.
You're charging how much for a room?	Let me just put on my glasses.
"Hello, this is a phone survey. If the election were held today, would you vote for ""A"" the cops are there, or ""B"" you are free to talk?"	Hello?
Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson.	"Uh, ""A."" And I'd like to add that proposition ""Hug Lisa For Me"" has my full support."
Lisa, this is from your Mom.	Good work, Lou. We'll leave right after dinner.
Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world.	Aw... Life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, Dad. I feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been.
The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!	What? Why?
To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father.	Why did you do that?
Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea.	How could you?
Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!	All right Simpsons, the jig is up! We know you're in there!
Cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. Ooh, a trash can. We'll find breakfast in here.	Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!
Oh, a banana!	I don't wanna eat from the trash.
It's full of cigarette butts. So is this one...	Oh, a banana!
We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo.	Those are the test animals! The detective must have sold them to the circus.
Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter.	How ya doin'.
In retrospect, yes.	You should have paid the expenses.
I'll just hide here.	Ooh, I think that fixed my back. Oh no, no. It's much worse.
Damn it!	Now what are you gonna do? You can't shoot all of us.
Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!	How did she find us?
How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.	I can't see!
Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again.	How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?	Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again.
Don't worry, honey. I released them all into the wild.	Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?
Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there...	Hey Dad, will you read me a bedtime story?
How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!	"This was done on her wedding day. Or should I say ""deading day."""
Woo hoo!	How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!
What do I do now?	Sword baseball bat, sword rifle, sword pineapple, sword sword sharpener, sword pie-- Hey what happened to the sword pie?
No, I'm good.	Do you need some assistance picking over the tattered remains of my life?
Hey, your early porno movies! Are any of these hetero?	No, I'm good.
Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?	What's there is there.
The weights that changed you from a Bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?	My first weight set.
I'll take it.	They know you are talking about them.
No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for.	There is no way all this junk is gonna fit in that car.
Perfect!	No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for.
Your heartbeat is so soothing.	"Sure, I'll carry you in this giant Snuggli. I used it to carry Rob Schneider in the movie ""My Baby Is An Ugly Man."""
It's all my fault my wife got mugged.	Mom, are you okay?
Emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body.	Wait Marge, I don't want you to leave the house without this.
Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin.	Why is it Ned Flanders?
Now Dr. Hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.	All right, just to the mailbox and back.
Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?	Two, three, two...
It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!	Two...
Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive.	Ten, ten, ten, ten...
Run!	Twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu...	Oh my goodness, it looks just like the Kwik-E-Mart!
Look, I'm the first to admit it. I don't write good parts for women.	I'm a magazine rack.
Kids, I'll go find your mother.	Aggh! Silly String!
Dad, we're canceling the rest of the play.	Kids, I'll go find your mother.
Marge?	What play? What the hell are you talking about?
Listen kids, your Mom is going to be living in the basement. But with our love, she'll get better soon.	I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
Then we'll have to smoke her out.	What if she doesn't?
Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just...	I roger that big time.
Wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! Isn't it, kids?	Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just...
Bart, eat your spinach.	The air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
Yes way!	No way.
"It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""Wings."" Then you could just sleep till Monday."	And all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
Ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! I'm married to Joey Heatherton.	Mom!
No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much.	Dad, do you plan to get in shape?
Alright Mom! / Yay, Mom! / Woo hoo!	I'm stronger than I've ever been! I don't have to go back inside. I'm not afraid!
Marge, that was amazing! It's like I'm married to Shaft.	You've just been Marge-inalized!
I'd rather talk about our feelings. I feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. Rebuttal?	Hey, hot stuff. I've got a competition tomorrow. I could use a good-luck snuggle.
Listen, my bulky flower, I-I have an early day...	Let's do it!
Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.	Huh? Why didn't Mom make our lunch?
Ow... Ow... Ow... Oww...	Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.
Quiet, her muscular ears can hear us.	I'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.
Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity.	So then I pop my delts, clench and bam! Not a dry eye in the house.
Sorry, sir, sorry.	And that's why I didn't win!
Denser?!	Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel...
Marge?	Disco Stu should have Disco Ducked.
Somewhere in that sea of bull hormones is the sweet, wonderful girl I married. The woman who instead of swatting a fly, will give it a bath and send it on its way. I'd sure like to go home and have Jiffy Pop with her.	Marge?
And I miss being your knight in flabby armor.	You know, I really do miss being a lady.
Good. Can you wax the car? Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm kidding! I'm kidding!	Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well, nachos are nachos.	Dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a WNBA game.
Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that.	Fine, I'll go back to being bored.
Mmm... Farfetched.	Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that.
Yes...	The winning fan is in Section A,
Yes...	Row 12...
Woo hoo!	... Seat 16!
Huh?	Woo hoo!
I think my leg is broken.	Thanks for supporting the WNBA, sir.
Well, I guess Flanders doesn't have all the luck.	I'm sorry sir, your car is still blocked in...
It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.	That cuts the mustard with me.
They thought of everything! How come all the good things happen to Jesus H. Nice? By which I mean Flanders!	The steering wheel is a giant onion ring!
The grass is actually greener on Flanders' side.	What are you doing?
No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes.	That's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
"Flanders, what's your secret? You never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""Mr. Blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me."	No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes.
So that's all it takes, a little prayer.	Well, whatever I've got I owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a little prayer now and then.
Ugh, where's the remote?	"And now ""Ken Burns,"" a documentary by Ken Burns about the life of Ken Burns."
Well, since I don't have the remote, I can just get up and change the channel.	They so consumed my life, I never had time for a proper haircut.
O, Merciful God, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote.	Wait a minute. I'll do what Flanders does.
There it is.	O, Merciful God, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote.
Die, monster!	I've never actually been to a baseball game. The fresh air gives me hives.
It worked! I got my wish! From now on, I'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding.	You're watching Monkey Olympics on Fox!
O Lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz.	She's throwing her diaper at the judges!
Yes!	O Lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz.
Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. I could do this all day. And I just might. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God.	Yes!
You know, I used to think God only helped professional athletes and Grammy winners. But now I realize he helps shmoes like me, too, Carl.	Setting up a prayer station, eh, Homer?
Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, I am reminded of Colonel Sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. Lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? I command you!	Makes sense to me. Ooh, by the way, did you see the judging in the monkey figure skating? Whose banana you gotta peel to get a five point nine? Could not believe that.
Mmm. Move over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend: Fudge.	Fudge!
Oh heavenly God, my son is plagued with homework. With your vast knowledge of the shore birds of Maryland, I know you can help him.	Mmm. Move over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend: Fudge.
Can and will. Now to un-stop this sink.	Homer, God isn't some kind of holy concierge. You can't keep bugging Him for every little thing.
Lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. Then take some time off for yourself. Fly to France. Have a nice dinner.	Can and will. Now to un-stop this sink.
Oh Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge. For thou art most wise...	I'll just call a plumber.
Marge, he's way the Hell up there.	You know, most people pray silently.
Well, we could live with a stopped-up drain.	Your pipes have more roots than the list of all-time top-rated TV shows.
Ooh, you coughed up some dry wall.	You was hiding behind the drywall. Yes you were! I'm glad Social Services didn't see this. Yes I am!
So that's your answer! I'll sue the church!	Slip and fall? Can't go back to work? I'm Larry H. Lawyer, Junior. And I will fight for you! I also habla español.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Homer, we can't sue the church. They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.
I couldn't help it. Those pews are so comfortable.	It wouldn't be the first time.
Can I borrow your pen to sign this deposition?	Homer, please don't sue the church. I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.
I can't see anything in this fog.	We're very sorry for the victim's injury. But as this tape demonstrates, Mr. Simpson is accident prone.
Woo-hoo! Can I get that in lottery tickets, please?	Okey-doke. We find for Mr. Simpson in the sum of one million dollars.
He's not giving it to me, God is. Because I prayed for it.	No.
It's all good.	Dad, I think this might be the work of Satan.
Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?	That is gonna drive me nuts.
The dog's on board, too.	And there are so many places to cloister myself!
Aw... he thinks he's papal.	The dog's on board, too.
Sweet.	Well, the court has spoken, so... here you go. The baptismal font tends to run, you have to jiggle the handle. Oh, and Wednesday is garbage day.
I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, BABY / YOU WERE MADE FOR LOVING ME...	Oh, I love this song.
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU, BABY...	I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, BABY / YOU WERE MADE FOR LOVING ME...
We'll just see about that.	Dad, there's a bunch of people in the Community Outreach Center.
You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!	Homer, that was not very Christian of you.
Bless you, bless you, how you doin'?	You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!
She went to Lovejoy's temporary church. She's worried about her immortal soul.	So where's Marge?
Eh, God's cool.	Homer aren't you afraid you might be, I don't know, incurring God's wrath?
Oh look, God's giving us a little shower.	See, I don't know that He is. In the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt.
Everybody, look at the much-needed rain. Thank you, God. Now turn the rainwater into wine.	Oh look, God's giving us a little shower.
Oh, wet and wonderful God, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. Surely this has proven whatever point you had.	Okay, I've got two of every animal. But only males -- I don't want any hanky-panky. Hey, hey, hey, cut that out!
God's ignoring me.	Oh, wet and wonderful God, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. Surely this has proven whatever point you had.
I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.	Dear Lord, please spare this sinful town. They were misled by a demon in blue pants.
It's such a mess. Watch the teeth!	I can't believe you talked me into this.
I was going to tell you on my deathbed.	How could you make me Baby Stink Breath and not even tell me?
La la la la la la la la la.	Your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a...
La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.	But there must be some sort...
I needed it. I had to buy back some incriminating photos.	You spent all the money I earned?!
Look. See. You're fine. And then--oops! Uh-oh. Look out...	I needed it. I had to buy back some incriminating photos.
I know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, Daddy's a hero!	Look. See. You're fine. And then--oops! Uh-oh. Look out...
See, Bart. I saved you.	I know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, Daddy's a hero!
That's okay. His cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.	Bart, stop that!
Now he's got it.	That's okay. His cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.
That's right. You're mine till you're eighteen. And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near, so I'm gonna work you like a dog.	Mom, I am sick of the way he treats me. He disrespects me and I'm just supposed to accept it?
Yes, son. At times like this I just look at my bracelet.	"I heard a wonderful saying today: ""forgive and forget."""
Jesus?! I thought it was Gepetto!	Good point, Dad. What would Jesus do?
Who is it?	Jesus?! I thought it was Gepetto!
Well, I'm not opening the door.	I'm here to serve you with a subpoena.
Is it crispy?	It comes with a side of bacon.
But not too crispy.	Yes.
See you in court.	But not too crispy.
Emancipated? Don't you like being a dude?	Yes, I want to be emancipated.
Hey, my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him. I just dumped him in the cheapest home I could find.	Mom, you've always been cool to me. But Homer is a lousy dad and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Why you little...! Um, I'm sorry, Judge. That's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor.	Mr. Simpson. Your son alleges that you have an anger management problem...
Why you little...!	Why you little...!
Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can.	All rise for the verdict.
Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.	No judge would send a pre-teen out on his own...
Mmmmm... garnish.	Further, I hereby garnish Homer's wages until Bart is fully repaid.
What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?	That means half your paycheck goes to Bart!
I'll show you worse!	Homer, don't make things worse.
I was told this would be televised!	I'll show you worse!
Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back.	Sorry Mom. I gotta go.
That's right! Crawling on your knees!	Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back.
Crawling! Oh, he's really gone. He's gone!	That's right! Crawling on your knees!
Look out, son. This one's got a little mustard on it!	Be quiet in there! Some of us are tryin' to sell drugs!
Attaboy! We just won the World Series! You and me together! Yeah!	Look out, son. This one's got a little mustard on it!
Of all the sites on all the web, I had to click onto his.	He can. There's a web cam right there.
Did you see that, boy? Your mom thinks you're still here!	Darn it! I keep pouring juice for five.
For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father.	I think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
For the past week I've been carrying around this bag of sugar. It's taught me how to love and care for a child.	For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father.
What the-- where the hell is my sugar?!	For the past week I've been carrying around this bag of sugar. It's taught me how to love and care for a child.
Hello, son. You're looking well.	Hi guys... Dad.
Of course, because you wouldn't want to... I paid for your splendor, you...!	Well, you need an expensive couch to watch an expensive TV.
Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.	Well, that's great, honey.
You know son, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I was wrong to exploit you, and I won't do it again.	Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?	Thanks Dad, that means a lot to me.
Psst, Mr. Hawk. May I have a word with you?	Just a reminder: If you're getting bogus returns on your investments...contact Goldman Sachs, the skewwwed financial planners. Up next on the half-pipe, boarding legend Tony Hawk.
Sure. My son is Bart Simpson and...	An extreme word?
Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.	I didn't say extreme to the max.
Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again.	I can relate. I'm a father myself. One day they're little shredders. And the next day they're grinding and gnashing their way to college.
Groovy.	This board represents the ultimate in poser technology. It gives people the illusion they have talent.
All the work?	Just lock your feet in and the board does all the work.
I'm challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it.	Now the portion of our event where champion Tony Hawk may be challenged by any unknown member of the audience.
Not very!	Dad, how drunk are you?
Now to win back my son in comfort and style.	Shhh.
You know, I could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home.	Now to win back my son in comfort and style.
Aw, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard, you stupid little kid.	Dad, you don't understand. This was never about being cool. It was about you not caring how I felt.
I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right.	Finally, someone explains it to me in words I can understand. Look, boy. I know I did wrong and I am truly sorry.
Anything... as long as I can give the money to my son.	Mr. Simpson, I like the way you handled yourself on that board. Would you like to do a commercial for us?
Well... I am bald and important. Where do I sign?	Excellent. I represent Viagrogaine, the topical rub for bald, impotent men.
Well, Kathy, I'll tell you. It's Viagrogaine. It gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. What are you waiting for, loser?	Oh, Steve. You're everything a girl could want. What's your secret?
What did they say about my scalp?	Possible side effects include loss of scalp and penis.
It's nice to see a realistic single woman on TV.	Now for the first of our eighty-two commercial breaks. Then you can see more of my boooobs.
Wow, I can't wait to pack that into my colon.	Ooh, a new hamburger sandwich.
I got arm veins, don't I?	Dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. You're running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart.
Mars, eh? Hmmm, I see no evidence of water.	It was so exciting -- I actually got applause for being smart!
The Ribwich! The commercials have come to pass!	Hey, hey the Ribwich is back!
You seem like an impartial observer. But I've been fooled by so many people in costumes.	Try the new Ribwich. It's so good you'll croak!
I could lick you all day long.	Try the sauce -- I'm soaked in it!
One Ribwich please.	And yet my children think I'm a failure.
Hm, now without lettuce.	One Ribwich please.
I have eaten the ribs of God.	Sir, are you all right?
Hey, who doesn't?	Oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!
That sounds like a magical family moment. I'm sorry I won't be there.	Well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?
Oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Only very serious Daddy business can tear me from your side.	Really? It won't be the same without you, Dad.
Three Ribwiches please. And instead of a shake I'd like a blended Ribwich.	Oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Only very serious Daddy business can tear me from your side.
Not again! First you took away my Philly Fudge Steak, and then my Bacon Balls, then my Whatcha-ma-chicken. You monster!	He's an acerose.
I'd like a large fries, please. And a collector's cup.	Not again! First you took away my Philly Fudge Steak, and then my Bacon Balls, then my Whatcha-ma-chicken. You monster!
Wow, this is amazing. I could follow the Ribwich from town to town.	Dude. If you still want the Ribwich, they're testing it in other markets. Check out the tour schedule.
Maybe I should hook up with you guys. After all, how long do any of us have to live?	That's what we do. We're Ribheads.
You monster! Why did you expel Boogerman?	"Welcome to the games of the 34th Spellympiad. I'm George Plimpton, founder of the Paris Review. I also played the evil dean in ""Boner Academy."""
That was awesome!	He replaced my tennis racket with a rubber phallus.
I'm sorry, honey. I can't be here tomorrow. It's the last day the Ribwich is in San Francisco.	Well, I'm just happy you guys all came up here to Calgary with me.
You don't understand. It's not just a sandwich. It's about brotherhood. It's about freedom. It's about three days since I've had one! I'm getting the shakes... and I'm getting the fries!	Dad, this is my moment in the sun. How can you miss it to be with a sandwich?
This can only be good.	Lisa, may I see you privately for a moment?
Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.	Hey man, can you turn me on?
The pig?	Will you get out of my... Look, about the Ribwich. There aren't gonna be anymore -- the animal we made 'em from is now extinct.
Welcome to the real world, hippies!	People, we went through something magical together -- and it's not important who got rich off of whom, or who was exposed to tainted what. And because you believed in my dream, I want you to fight over the last Ribwich ever made. Here.
Lisa? Is this what I've come to? Fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? Mister, I'll take that car.	I give-a you the lease-a to my car.
Daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!	"Intransigence. ""I..."""
Damn right honey. You're number one on my menu. Now super-size it!	Dad, you do care!
Yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car.	Lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing.
It came out again.	Hold your horses. I was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
Enough talk. Dip me, my love.	Oh, what a magical evening. The moonlight, the music, the water...
I know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. There's the Tongue-Kissing Festival... Cinco de Ocho... The Hobo Oscars... days just made for lovers. Not widowers, lovers.	Poor Ned. This is his first Jellyfish Festival alone.
Flanders?! Can't a man just drink alone on a Wednesday morning?	Psst! Homer!
Ooh! Lemme guess. Skinner's mother. She sure knows how to swing it.	I need your advice. It's about a lady.
Sara Sloane? The movie star?	No, it's Sara Sloane. I have a date with her tonight.
Flanders, I mix Twinkies and Ding Dongs all the time. In Europe they call it a Dinkie.	Yep. Why would that Twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be.	Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett.
Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders.	Now she's dating Mr. Flanders. That's so romantic!
Hello? Yes, I'm Ned Flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. Oh yes, I she does look pregnant. Now, who might you be? A tabloid? Is that one of those really strong mints? Hello? Hello?	Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders.
Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M.	Mm-hmm. I haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
Moe, what are you doing here?	Why, those guys are such leeches.
Stupid Flanders. I'm not giving you any of my secret moves.	Homer, Sara wants us to have S-E-X.
Look, Flanders. I'm always interested in talking about free milk. And if there's cookies involved, so much the better.	"Well, I'm not sure I want to do it. I mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" You know, the cow being me."
Poor Ned, gardening away his misery.	I bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
Me too.	I'm very happy for you, Ned.
Uh-oh. Here comes Helen Fielding.	Me too.
Droll.	I need a quarter for the bus.
Mmm... promo.	Droll.
Ew, Fox!	Mmm... promo.
Do - you - hear - a - noise?	Nutty fudgkins!
Marge germs!	I got Lisa's plankton kebabs!
I'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.	How much longer is this going to go on?
Tissues please!	I'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.
Get... out of my... airspace!	Tissues please!
I'm on my way. You man the rake.	Dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?
It was an application to open a Cinnabon stand.	We've already been to room 915. We've already filled out form 1790.
Never!	I never thought I would say this, but I think we have to move.
Stay plugged in! I will find you!	Never!
Now Cookie, do you think you can sell this house?	Stay plugged in! I will find you!
See, it all works out?	Occasionally, you might hear a faint roar...
Make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.	It's a good offer. I advise you to take it.
That's a great idea. Why didn't you say something before?	Why don't we go to our Congressman?
What?	I've been saying it for three weeks! But every time I open my mouth...
I SEE A BAD MOON RISING...	Quick! Someone perform CPR.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN FOR NASTY WEATHER...	That's CCR!
I guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.	Congressman Wilcox was laid to rest today. A special election will be held next month to fill his vacant seat.
It's just an expression, Marge.	How can you say that?
Eh, I'm still undecided.	Why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
Bo-ring!	Because I was thinking about the American family! One family in particular, who was stepped on by the government and had nowhere else to turn.
Let him speak!	I'm talking about the Simpsons.
Krusty, you've let everyone down. And even worse, you've let down this sacred document.	You said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. And now they're worse than ever.
Stained with the blood of American patriots.	Dad, this is a kid's menu where you help Yogi Bear get to the Washington Monument.
From the unknown toaster.	That's jelly.
Yeah. And to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!	We've gotta do something to help him.
Beat it, Waxie.	Excuse me, I think I can help. I've been working in this town for a long time, and well, I know how to get things done.
Sir, I studied under Ed McMahon!	Now Homer, that Southern Congressman is your biggest obstacle. Your job is to drink him under the table so he misses the vote. You think you can do it?
How 'bout before?	How 'bout a drinkin' contest, boy? Right after I vote on the latest bill.
You call this a bicameral legislature?	Now we just need a distraction.
I say, I say... my groin!	You call this a bicameral legislature?
That's right. Over the homes of poor people.	At last those planes are flying where they belong.
Oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire.	What about you and Mom?
Children, so naïve.	Oh, okay.
I didn't say anything. So naïve.	Who's naïve?
Oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. Have some more liquor.	This is so romantic.
That's it, drink up my pretty.	Oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. Have some more liquor.
"Thanks for the love tip, ""60 Minutes II."""	That's it, drink up my pretty.
Mm, funky!	"Thanks for the love tip, ""60 Minutes II."""
Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood. I ate your granny and now I'm in the mood for love.	Mm, funky!
But it's St. Valentine's Day! God wants us to do it.	Homie, I'm sorry... you know I usually bring my A-game to the bedroom... but tonight I just can't throw the heat.
Well, my special mix tape will get you going.	You're so cute when you're begging for sex, but I'm just too tired.
Oh, no! That's Maggie's mix tape! Then Maggie must have gotten...	Well, my special mix tape will get you going.
Shot down on Valentine's Day. That's supposed to be a gimme. Everybody's gettin'some but me.	Oh, no! That's Maggie's mix tape! Then Maggie must have gotten...
Everyone but me.	Game over.
Suicide, eh?	Marge doesn't think I'm sexy. What am I supposed to do?
That's it! Thank you, outdoor advertising! You saved my marriage -- and not for the first time.	Suicide, eh?
"""Releasing your inner screenplay,"" ""Create an online kennel,"" ooh, ""Strip for your wife!"""	That's it! Thank you, outdoor advertising! You saved my marriage -- and not for the first time.
Dr. Hibbert? You're the teacher?	"Welcome to ""How to Strip for Your Wife""."
Three coats.	Homer, are you already oiled?
Aren't you gonna chuckle?	Homer, take this quarter, call your mother and tell her you're never going to be a stripper.
Nobody loves oily Homer...	There's nothing to chuckle about.
You know everything about me!	You there, the greasy, naked bald man!
Wipe me down and sign me up!	What would you say if I offered you the secret of true success?
You're preaching to the choir, man.	The trick is to blot the oil. Wiping just pushes it around.
Uh, well, I drew it on... See...	You see this watch? It's jammed with so many jewels, the hands can't move. What kind of watch do you have?
Oooh, published by Kinko's!	"Friends, there's a force that runs through the universe. We used to call that force ""God."" We now call it ""Megatronics: The Forty-eight Tips To Corporate Success."""
Yes!	Do you want to be the ultimate you?
Yes!	Do you want to yodel at the top of the corporate mountain?
God yes!	"Will you write me a check made out to ""cash?"""
"Tip one, ""Live each day like it was your last."""	God yes!
I don't wanna die! I'm so young.	"Tip one, ""Live each day like it was your last."""
"Tip two, ""Let nothing stand in your way."""	I don't wanna die! I'm so young.
"Listen up, ""life obstacles."" From now on, nothing's gonna stand in Homer Simpson's way!"	"Tip two, ""Let nothing stand in your way."""
Do your homework!	"Listen up, ""life obstacles."" From now on, nothing's gonna stand in Homer Simpson's way!"
Don't do so much homework!	Do your homework!
Learn to talk!	Don't do so much homework!
You, let's love. Now!	Learn to talk!
Go on ahead. I'll just slow you down.	Sounds good to me.
It's the sound of a go-getter at work, Marge. Look, I installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are.	What's that ruckus?
"Megatronics Tip twenty: ""Make your cubicle into a you-bicle."""	I finally harnessed the awesome power of the hook. Well, time for work.
"Hmm. What next, Megatronics? ""Point out problems at your workplace to your boss. To separate yourself from the herd, just tattle on the cattle. Hm."	"Megatronics Tip twenty: ""Make your cubicle into a you-bicle."""
And now to see Mr. Burns for the promotion and raise I've deserved since this morning.	Uh-oh, that's toxic waste!
Mr. Burns, I've made a list of recommendations to improve plant efficiency.	And now to see Mr. Burns for the promotion and raise I've deserved since this morning.
But the book said you would applaud my initiative.	Oh, have you now? Well huzzah, huzzah. I'll just throw back my legs and pollute my britches with delight.
Yes, sir.	Would you mind?
Ahhh, look at the little eels. Electric eels!	Yes, sir.
"Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."	I didn't know Mr. Burns had an electric eel pond.
Thanks for trying, but I'll be at Moe's.	Oh, Homie. Don't let it get you down. So Mr. Burns doesn't take you seriously? Big whoop! Who gives a doodle? Whoopie ding dong doo!
I gave Mr. Burns the best years of my life. And how much respect does he give me?	So my husband goes to a bar every night. Whoop de doo. Who gives a bibble? Gabba gabba hey!
Moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years.	Who's this Burns guy? Somebody you work with?
Revenge? On Mr. Burns?	Well, if this guy's ridin' your rump, why don't you slap him some payback?
No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral.	Or give him some face time with sweet lady brick.
Wait'll he steps on this flaming bag of... Lisa's college fund?!	No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral.
Get rid of a bird? No way. Their eyes are so expressive.	Don't you get it? If you get rid of that bird, Burns is at your mercy.
Why are you looking at me like that?	Homie, what's wrong?
I have a plan to get to the top, but I have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. I'm not sure I could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal.	Why are you looking at me like that?
Mr. Burns! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is here for a surprise inspection!	Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?
Hello!	Good Lord! That canary was supposed to be my pigeon. I need to find a patsy quick!
Hello!	Yes, yes, hello. Now, I need to find a patsy.
Hello!	You're quite the friendly fellow, but right now I'm looking for a patsy.
Hello!	You bumbling fool, I keep telling you I'm looking for a patsy.
That's right. And as my first act... Mr. Burns, you're fired!	Finally, I would like to add to any nuclear inspectors in the crowd, that the titular head of the power plant is now Mr. Homer J. Simpson.
No, it's entirely within my power. Furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. Check and mate. Now, king me!	That man's mad. Smithers, get this bedlamite an alienist!
Huh?	So, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. I only have one thing to say to that... bravo.
Mr. Burns?	We clashed lances on the Champs de Mars, and I have been bested. The plant is yours. Treat her well.
Eat crowd, old man!	Yes?
Hey, that looks fun! Do me!	HEY-EY-EY, GOODBYE!
Mr. Burns' reign of terror is over.	Homer! Homer! Homer!
Unlike Mr. Burns, I will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. And now, as I ascend this crystal staircase to my office, I say: avert your gaze!	Oh, I don't think he was going that way.
That is so cool. Bart, open the door.	Unlike Mr. Burns, I will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. And now, as I ascend this crystal staircase to my office, I say: avert your gaze!
Now, open it again and put a walnut in there.	That is so cool. Bart, open the door.
You're right. Put two walnuts in there.	Dad, please. You're the head of a major corporation.
Sweetie, these things are gonna take time. I just found the door-shutting thing.	Dad, have you looked at this earnings report?
Oh! Oh, yeah.	Sweetie, these things are gonna take time. I just found the door-shutting thing.
I need a vacation.	If you don't patch the leak in cooling tower two, you will go to jail.
Can't I water ski a little bit?	This is your vacation.
No deal!	Homer I'll go over the year-end profit forecast if you'll stop looking at my boobs.
That's great, honey. Hold it up to the camera.	I got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive.
Look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. I f...	Homie, I know you've got a lot of work to do. But this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family.
...best quality pork chops.	Look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. I f...
Lisa, I deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce.	Dad, this just isn't working.
Well, I have to work, but give the monitor a kiss.	Hey Dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight.
C'mon, boy. You're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor.	I don't wanna do that.
Hey! That's a printer port, not a finger hole.	C'mon, boy. You're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor.
Hey, honey. Sorry I'm so late. I had to lay off twenty-seven robots. Don't tell me they can't cry.	Homie?
Bart's growing up without me. He won't be ten forever.	No, Billy Crystal.
Mr. Burns! Where's Mr. Smithers?	Knock, knock.
How did you ever run this place? You've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon...	He's doing eighty years on an opium bust. I never saw a man take to a Turkish prison so quickly.
Yes, yes. If I keep putting work first, I'll lose everyone I care about, just like you did.	Does it bother you that Krusty uses mad-cow beef to save money?
Thank you, Mr. Burns. Thank you for... huh?	Yes, yes. If I keep putting work first, I'll lose everyone I care about, just like you did.
What are you doin'?	Steal my plant will you? By the time you wake up, you'll be walled inside my mausoleum forever!
I don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. I don't even want it.	Scream all you like, no one will hear you!
There you go.	Brick by brick, I seal his doom.
From now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest Dad.	Hey Dad, pitch to me!
Quit crowding the plate!	Hey! You nearly hit me on the head!
Oh, you want a piece of me?	Quit crowding the plate!
Yeah.	Y'see? This is the stuff Mom won't do with me.
Ow! Ow! He bit me! You saw him! He bit me! You little...	Yeah.
No, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer.	And what's that?
Talking won't get you there.	Nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. All that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
Lisa, what's bumming you out? They cancel a test or something?	Talking won't get you there.
It's a concern. A serious concern.	Dad, my life lacks direction!
Sweetie, Daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check.	Oh Dad, look at this one!
Boi-oi-oi-oinggg!	We certainly do.
No, of course not!	Why did you say that? Is your check gonna bounce?
Duh-uh.	No, of course not!
I have to go.	Why did you say that? Are you implying that I'm dumb?
Oh my God! Space monsters are invading us!	I have to go.
Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?	Dad, that's a moth.
You may be a smart kid, Lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings.	Dad, that's a kaleidoscope.
Mmm... bad eggs.	Uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
Hey Mr. Smithers!	Okay, we've gotta start recruiting, Lou.
It's this new anti-crime dealie. The mayor turned the streetlights way up. My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.	Hey Mr. Smithers!
I'unno. What am I, Superdad?	Pro or con?
I'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.	Boy, this light has really screwed up the animals.
Don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?	Live from New York it's Saturday Night!
Aw... my baby's first words.	Palm recognized. Access granted!
Night... glorious night...	It worked -- I got my sky back! Dad, look!
I wish God were alive to see this.	Thanks, Mom.
I hope it's as fun as Pictionary was last week.	I wonder what Mom came up with for this week's 'Family Wednesday.'
What? Are you sure?	Dad, we weren't playing Pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking.
Oh, I hate this. It's making me use my arms.	I'm in.
Hey! These two pieces were already connected -- we're halfway there!	Oh, I hate this. It's making me use my arms.
Can't help you -- all I got is gray. Anybody working on a cement wall?	Does anyone have any swan heads? I've got nothing but necks.
Oh, right. Chinese guy, Chinese guy, frisbee dog...	Turn it over, Homer.
It's how the pros do it.	Homer, no scissors!
Now let's see. This is either an old coconut... or Tom Hayden.	Oh, I guess he's done with all the fun stuff.
It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.	I can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
Prove me wrong, Silent Bob.	It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.
Looks like you're missing a wife.	Ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. But it looks like you're missin' a piece.
"Or when I messed up taping ""City Slickers 2"" and cut off the end. Was Curly's gold just a legend?"	This awful. It's like listening to Schubert's unfinished symphony!
Puzzle piece, come out and play-ay.	Hey, remember that pet gerbil we used to have? He didn't run away after all.
"Hey, what's this? ""Marge's Memory Chest."""	Puzzle piece, come out and play-ay.
Aww, Marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. The fake business card I made up to impress her...	"Hey, what's this? ""Marge's Memory Chest."""
T-shirt from our first rock concert...	Aww, Marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. The fake business card I made up to impress her...
"""Moe's Tavern Grand Opening..."" That was back when his floors were sticky with promise."	T-shirt from our first rock concert...
I can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.	I shouldn't have cheaped out on the shelf.
Hey, there's writing on the back of this.	I can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.
"""Dear Homer, I can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."""	Hey, there's writing on the back of this.
The only dangerous amount is none!	Young man, you've ingested a dangerous amount of alcohol.

Okay, Burger King! Whatever! C'mon.	Let's go to IHOP! I'm drivin'.

Marge... did I ruin your life?	Homie, what's wrong?
No, the voters will decide that in November. I was talking about this.	Oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?
More like, where didn't I find it. It was practically everywhere.	Oh my God, I forgot all about this. Where did you find it?
Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?	Homer, I'm sorry you saw that, but I was very upset that night.
So you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?	Well, I love you, of course. But a lot of things you do still drive me crazy.
Fine. I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.	A little bit, yeah.
That was a muffin!	Looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
"Oh, I get it. Your stupid husband is too ""drunk"" to do it right."	I'll fix you something.
Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?	Well, there are a lot of beer cans around here.
Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years. Is it that horrible living with me?	Homer, let it go. It's not always going to be perfect. We've been married for ten years.
It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells.	Well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
Now you're just making up rules. Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?	Maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think.	Dad, where are you going?
No, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents. Now if you need me I'll be staying with Milhouse's father.	But you're not gonna get divorced like Milhouse's parents, are you?
You don't have a doorknob.	Welcome to my place. I just have a few rules. If you see a necktie on the doorknob, I'm with a lady.
Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?	Arlene!
Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box.	Uh, Homer, I think you want your house, next door.
"""Apartment Finder: We put you in your place."" ""Roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. Spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" Thank you, news box... It's gone!"	Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box.
What a well-kept street. And there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.	All right, I got me a place to put my spiders.
It's a cinch these guys never had any kids.	What a well-kept street. And there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
What's the deal with this place? It's so manly, yet scented.	Hello, Simpson.
Nice to meet you, Stuart.	No. He's nobody! Shut up, Stuart!
Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly.	Homer, before you move in, you should know that Julio and I have an active social life.
Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?	Homer, what Grady is saying is that, how can I put this? We might have a cocktails, say, where all the guests are male.
You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it.	That's right, Homer. We're gay.
You guys lead a fascinating life. Like, why are you reading the New York Times? You don't live in New York.	My spices!
Calm down, Picky Ricardo. He made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way.	Uch, where'd you buy this? From the guy on the exit ramp? This is disgusting.
Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay.	Thank you, Homer. It's a pleasure cooking for you.
Way ahead of you.	"It's either him or that girl who put ""Mother Earth"" as a reference. And with a male roommate, we can walk around naked."
I see.	That will be one hundred dollars.
Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have.	Your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
Why you little...!	Hey, I love watching you guys fight. It's my earliest memory.
You noticed! I've been using Lancôme.	Dad, your hands feel so soft.
Well, I'd better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I want to ask you.	Oh, it shows! I haven't had a strangle that smooth since I was four.
How much do you tip a leg waxer? I need to know by tomorrow!	Yes, Homie?
The kids are cool, but Marge is still judging me.	So, how was your visit home?
Maybe it is. I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see Rip Taylor. But now, I don't know what's gonna happen. C'mon, let's dance.	So, it's over between you two.
Tennessee Williams?! But how did he survive in the world of theater?	He's gay. He's gay. Gay. Gay. Bi. Gay. Gay for pay. Gay.
Weird Al Yankovic!	Homie, I tried to tell you how I feel, but I can't find the right words. Maybe he can.
Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?	Homer, Marge wrote me about what happened. And as soon as her check cleared, I was on the first reasonably-priced flight here.
"Which one was better: ""Livin' La Pizza Loca"" or ""Another One Bites The Crust""?"	Yes.
Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman.	They were pretty much the same, Homer.
It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.	Now here's a song I wrote for you. A LITTLE DITTY 'BOUT HOMER AND MARGE / HER HEART WAS AS BIG AS HIS STOMACH WAS LARGE / OH YEAH, THEY SAY LOVE GOES ON / LONG AFTER THE GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH IS GONE.
I don't know... date a chick with kids...	Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?
All right, all right.	Dad!
Wait a minute... Marge likes a little bit of stubble.	Oh, you do? Oh God, Lisa, if I was an eight-year-old straight boy, I swear to God I would so be holding your hand right now.
Uh-oh. Gotta even it out.	Wait a minute... Marge likes a little bit of stubble.
Margarita... that's Mexican for Marge. I'll take that as a sign!	Well, we've got the cure for that. Margaritas!
I've learned a lot living here. It doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are, unless they're a celebrity, in which case it's dish, dish, dish!	And please turn off thy cell phones and pagers.
You guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?	Homer, weren't you supposed to meet your wife half an hour ago?
I gotta go.	Hey, Julio: ouch.
Sorry I'm late -- the Velvet Mafia made me a Margarita I couldn't refuse.	We welcome Cub Scout troop number 102, we wish a happy birthday to Karen, and congratulations to Marge and Homer Simpson on their reconciliation dinner.
But it was Marge. My first and only love. I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless!	That's better.
Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!	Oh Homer, a guy as cool and special as you will have no trouble. Believe me.
You know, Moe, I was just thinking. My problems with Marge started because I drink too much. And then tonight alcohol only made things worse. Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by...	Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!
Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage.	But it's still not as bad as the first time I treated you for alcohol poisoning.
You have that on tape?!	Destroyed your marriage? Why, I've never seen a woman look so devoted. Let's look at the tape.
So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!	He's stable now. I'll leave you two alone.
Marge, I never want to be apart from you again.	And I still do.
That is the best kiss I've had tonight.	Well, you'll never have to.
Manly thoughts.	Homie, what are you thinking?
Those suck. They're worse than nothing. I could write way better songs.	Not true! But you are welcome to sing the many beloved public domain carols such as O Tannenbaum, Good King Wenceslas, Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring--
CHRISTMAS IN DECEMBER / WOW WOW WOW / GIVE ME TONS OF PRESENTS / NOW NOW NOW!	That's it, I'm writing a Christmas carol. If I can make my own clothes, I can do anything.
Maybe.	Hey Homer, writing a new Christmas carol?
Flanders, I am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. But even I have my limits. Now beat it!	Oh, I got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus.
EVERYBODY IN THE USA / HATES THEIR STUPID NEIGHBOR / HE'S FLANDERS AND HE'S REALLY REALLY LAME / FLANDERS TRIED TO WRECK MY SONG / HIS VIEWS ON BIRTH CONTROL ARE WRONG / I HATE HIS GUTS AND FLANDERS IS HIS NAME.	How am I supposed to write a song with that stupid jerk bothering me all the time... Wait a minute...
HE'S THE MAN THAT I HATE BEST / I'D LIKE TO SEE HIS HOUSE GO UP IN FLAME!	F-L-A-N-R-D-S!
Hey, Mister? If you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? It's already rewound.	Yeah, he wishes.
Fine.	No thanks. But I would like to sing it with you and produce it.

IF YOU DESPISE POLITE LEFT-HANDERS...	HE'S YOUR PERKY, PEPPY NIGHTMARE NEIGHBORINO!
Hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?	Mass dismissed!
Me too -- I've come to hate my own creation. Now I know how God feels.	I am so sick of that song!
Well, I guess we could afford one nice trip.	Why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
"What? It said ""take one."""	I still think you should have left that at the motel.
Sweet.	And there's no radio or TV, so we won't have to hear your song!
And fight the crowds? Forget it. The Simpsons are going to Bart's idea!	Or we could go to Walter Gropius's Bauhaus Village?
This dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.	And fight the crowds? Forget it. The Simpsons are going to Bart's idea!
Those poor hats.	"""On this battleground in 1881, fifty-six Indians lost their lives and four brave Americans lost their hats."""
Coming, sweetie!	Daddy, I need upsies!
Can you shoot one where I'm Rambo and my wife is Betty Boop?	Would you like to be photographed in my great-grandfather's headdress? He unified the nations of the western plains. Five dollars, or three for twelve.
You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?	Unfortunately, the beaver is also our God. In retrospect it was a poor choice.
How many decks will your blackjack dealers use?	Sure. And when we do, your breakfast will be comped.
Three.	Eight.
Deal. My brother...	Four.
All right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble Native Americans can reclaim the land that is theirs.	I didn't gasp like that until I was eighteen!
So long, suckers!	I'll save you!
Stop shoving! The little one isn't getting any.	So long, suckers!
/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...	Oh no! They're making beautiful music together!
This map is useless! Useless!	/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
It's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. What are you gonna do?	Homie, I'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up.
Check it out, beavers. Delicious motel furniture!	I look forward to it. Ha ha ha ha, I hate you.
Uh-oh! We forgot to empty the mini-bar!	They took the bait. Let's go.
That's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!	Uh-oh! We forgot to empty the mini-bar!
Quick, find the master log! There's always a master log.	Let it go, Dad.
We did it! Finally, man has triumphed over a small, furry animal!	Quick, find the master log! There's always a master log.
Fresca?!	Actually, it's Fresca.
Look at those stupid city slickers, with their fur coats and pointy hats.	What's up, Cootie Breath?
I still hate them. Go back to Pittsburgh!	Homer, those are elk.
A lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.	You would do that just for me... That's despicable! You're the kind of city slicker my family left Central Park West to avoid. You've got a lot of chutzpah, Missy. Goodbye.
Who is he?!	Lisa, welcome to love. It's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. But then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts.
Woo hoo! In your face, imaginary guy!	You, Homie.
Don't worry, son. I'll build you a new treehouse. One so grand it'll be an affront to God himself.	MOM-MY!...
Only if it's an affront to God.	Can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
Only losers buy wood. We're going to nature's lumberyard.	Hey, you passed the lumberyard.
It's okay, Bart. This track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh.	Isn't this dangerous?
Did Frank Lloyd Wright have to deal with people like you?	I'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track.
Look, I have no idea who Frank Lloyd Wright is.	Actually, Frank Lloyd Wright endured a lot of harsh criticism.
I was just puttin' words together.	You said his name two seconds ago.
Well, two can play at that game.	Gotcha.
Stop it!	Oh, that's it. You are going down.
Son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. It really restores your faith in helpful weirdos.	The Amish are so industrious. Not like those shiftless Mennonites.
Heck no, the Amish did it. Who knows more about electricity than the Amish?	Very nice. Did you do the wiring yourself?
Watch your step... Don't panic... By going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue.	/ Help!
Oh thank God, the dog's here! Pull me free, boy.	Head burning... legs freezing. Middle... very pleasant.
Don't be scared, you can do it!	Oh thank God, the dog's here! Pull me free, boy.
Hey! Where are you goin'? I'm your pal! I took you for a walk once!	Don't be scared, you can do it!
Move the net under the window.	Homie, get out of that treehouse!
But as for you, Santa's Little Helper, you are a selfish coward and a bad dog!	I always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
Quit following me, you coward!	Our little hero sure likes Kahlua and Cream.
"All my life, Kent. I prefer ""catsup"" to ""ketchup."" And to me, ""Yusuf Islam"" will always be ""Cat Stevens."""	Mr. Simpson, how long have you been a cat person?
God no, it sucks.	"Terrific stuff. You must really love the Broadway musical ""Cats."""
Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog.	Seems like you're quite the animal lover. Do you have any other pets? A dog perhaps?
Hmm... needs beer.	"""Grow a mustache,"" says the wife. ""You'll look handsome,"" says the wife."
Why you little...!	Hmm... needs beer.
Fine.	Stop it, Homer, that's inhumane! Use the choke chain!
I want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. Marge, prepare the emergency ham.	Fine.
I don't care if his name is Bony McDork, just make the checks out to me.	"According to this contract, we have to change his name to ""Suds McDuff."""
Corporate jet?	It also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the Duff corporate jet.
Sweet.	Oh pilot, let's swing by... oh, Heidelberg and drop in on Oktoberfest.
Welcome back to the family, boy.	Sweet.
Who are you, my biographer?	Dad, five minutes ago you hated him.
Boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of Marge.	...eight, nine, ten wads of cash. Your dog has sent Duff beer sales through the roof.
Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog.	Oh really? Well this tape says different.
My wads! I never even broke the wrapper.	Dad, you can't let him take our dog!
Aww. There, there, boy. I'll help you get him back. He may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a Simpson that isn't.	But I miss him. He was my best friend.
A plan, eh? Okay, we'll use a plan.	Look, to get our dog back, we need a plan.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!	This stunt cost fifty million dollars!
Everything is going according to plan. I'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.	And you've been bitching about it for thirty years.
"Now let me think. How did that beautiful young naked lady in ""Jaws"" make it out alive?"	Are you there, God? It's me, Duffman.
I'm sorry I was ever mean to you. Marge, prepare the celebration ham.	It's good to have you back with the Simpsons.
Marge, they're just hams, okay.	All we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
Well, boy, now that we got you back, I'm never gonna let you go again.	Marge, they're just hams, okay.
"To me that says ""I love you."""	Uh-oh, Dad. I think he peed on the rug.
Aw, it was probably that stupid cat.	"I think he left a ""big hug"" in your lunch box."
What has he done for me lately?	That cat saved your life.
Yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna.	He woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.
Everyone's against me.	Dad, you ate the last can of tuna.
Bart, are you okay?	Okay, five more minutes and I'm chewing my hand off.
Hey, take it easy. I went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family...	Homie, where have you been? I've been calling all over for you!
That monkey's wearin' a hat.	He's Editor-In-Chimp!
"You can't just ""get"" a cell phone."	Well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so I can reach you.
Can I get a phone that plays the Mexican Hat Dance?	Lindsay Naegle -- Veriqual Cellular. And I can offer you a whole range of cellular solutions.
I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AROUND A MEXICAN HAT / I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT / OR IS IT I GUESS I'LL KEEP SINGING / MY CELL PHONE APPEARS TO BE RINGING...	I insist on it.
Barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?	I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AROUND A MEXICAN HAT / I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT / OR IS IT I GUESS I'LL KEEP SINGING / MY CELL PHONE APPEARS TO BE RINGING...
Hands-free, eh? Then I could give the brothers the black power salute.	Why don't you get one of those hands-free phones? It's the next best thing to paying attention to the road.
Black power! Black power!	Hands-free, eh? Then I could give the brothers the black power salute.
Uh... a lighter.	Of course we have headsets. But you would be mad to stop there. Tell me -- what is currently plugged into your car's cigarette lighter?
I'll take 'em.	"I weep for you. These days, everything from fax machines to coffee makers can be plugged into your ""dash hole."""
DVD player? Check. Snow-cone machine? Check. Lite Brite?	I'll take 'em.
Check. Fog machine?	DVD player? Check. Snow-cone machine? Check. Lite Brite?
Even I think this is crazy.	Check. Fog machine?
CHAKA KHAN, LET ME ROCK YOU / LET ME ROCK YOU, CHAKA KHAN / CHAKA KHAN CHAKA KHAN...	Even I think this is crazy.
Come on, transmit. Transmit!	Oh my God! I've got to do something.
Save me Chaka Khan! Chaka Khannnn!	Come on, transmit. Transmit!
I'll never mock the Coast Guard again. You Navy rejects are all right!	Save me Chaka Khan! Chaka Khannnn!
I am so screwed. I can't drive to work, I can't drive to the store, and I certainly can't drive to the store at work.	Burn their poop.
That reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in Shelbyville.	I guess I'll have to do all your driving chores. That's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
I didn't want them to know my size.	Why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
Thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, Marge.	I didn't want them to know my size.
Where is your mother? I've gotta get to Moe's.	That always means no.
Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk.	Dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. Why don't you take public transportation?
Stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. I miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!	Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk.
I did it. I walked all the way to Moe's from my house.	Ralphie, if you stop the car, I'll let you play with my gun.
You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.	Way to go, Dad!
No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover.	Get in here, boozy. You're late for your drunkening.
You know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy I am.	Who the hell am I talkin' to?
You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.	You know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy I am.
You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup.	Good for you, Dad. Could you get me some syrup?
Calm down, Stresserella!	We don't have time for choking!
Now now, honey. We all appreciate what you do. But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. You could get in a lot of trouble with the Livery Commission.	I'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, I'm a full-time family chauffeur!
Marge, you don't know what you're saying!	To hell with the Livery Commission!
What a day for a stroll.	Marge, you don't know what you're saying!
Look at those suckers in their metal coffins. I can go to work any way I want.	Read the directions silently as I read them aloud to you.
Psst. Bishop to queen four.	Look at those suckers in their metal coffins. I can go to work any way I want.
"I said, ""Bishop to queen four."""	We're playing dominoes.
Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking.	Why, you're the first one here! Please accept this free ticket to the 1939 World's Fair.
How 'bout we take a family walk around the block?	Come nightfall.
Honey, you seem frazzled. Why don't you come with us?	Stop saying things!
You sure love driving.	Hey, I'd like that. I can't. I have to go pick up Grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station.
It sure has. You see this bulge back here?	Yeah, walking's made a new man out of you.
Now it actually is a fanny pack.	It sure has. You see this bulge back here?
No, wait. It's still my ass. But your point is well taken. You see...	Now it actually is a fanny pack.
I LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE AVENUE / BUST A MOVE WITH DISCO STU...	No, wait. It's still my ass. But your point is well taken. You see...
YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD...	YOU SHAKE ME FROM MY BOOTY TO MY 'FRO...
I RARELY FEEL THE NEED TO UTTER D'OH!	YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD...
Top of the mornin', ladies.	I RARELY FEEL THE NEED TO UTTER D'OH!
I CAN WALK FROM SPRINGFIELD TO ALASKA / THEN HOBNOB WITH THE STARS IN MALIBU...	Bite us.
"The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""Fargo""?"	Hi Homer. I'm actor Steve Buscemi.
AND WHEN I HEAR...	"The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""Fargo""?"
"I SAY ""OF COURSE I CAN -- SCREW YOU!"""	YOU CAN'T WALK TO TURKMENISTAN!
OH, I LOVE TO PERAMBULATE / IT'S STANDING STILL I REALLY HATE / SO LET ME PLEASE REITERATE / I LOVE TO...	Would we!
Pretty good. Thanks for asking.	I am so sorry, Homie. How is your crushed pelvis?
It's okay, Marge. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch.	I don't know what happened. I saw you and I went for the brake but I hit the accelerator!
Too hot! Too hot!	That's okay. I can handle it. Homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?
Hot! Hot! Hot! Warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!	I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever.	Oh, you're really coming along, Homie.
Marge, you're trying to hurt me!	Oh my God! Let me help you up!
No, it's true. The car, the soup... It's like you hate me... your own husband...	What? That's crazy.
I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you.	That's ridiculous. I don't like you. I mean hate you, hate you, hate you! I hate you!
"Who's ""we""? Got a mouse in your purse?"	Maybe we should see a counselor.
Nothing could be farther from the...	Perhaps you feel that your husband sees you as less of a partner and more of a doormat.
You could be on to something there, Doc...	Nothing could be farther from the...
Sorry, I got a lot on my mind.	You could be on to something there, Doc...
There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me.	All right, before you came in, I asked you each to make a list of the people that are most important to you. Homer, you first.
We've gotta help her. If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy Moe is very happy. But for once, this isn't about Moe. What should I do, Dr. Hot Dog?	That's us in a nutshell. I care so much about you, Homer, but I'm not even on your list. Excuse me.
You mean... like give her full custody of the kids?	All right. I have an answer. You must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture.
I see. Do you have any suggestions?	You gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic... something that says I care about you.
Here's a dollar.	I do, but the hour is over.
Gotta go.	Romantic dinner.
I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings.	You wanna know how to make a peach crumble? Kick it in the groin. Ha, anyway, what's goin' on?
You can bring a bag of ice.	Hey, me too. I could whip up my famous poulet au vin avec champignons à la Carl.
Pick one.	You can bring a bag of ice.
Honey, I couldn't keep 'em away if I tried. Except for Flanders. He was mysteriously called out of town.	Oh Homie, you got everyone in Springfield here for me!
Tonight, we're here to serve you. Sit back and enjoy the finest foods Springfield has to offer.	I got your letter, Jesus and I'm coming as fast as I can.
That I fixed with new words!	Just kidding. Here's one of my many classics.
SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD.	YOU HOOKED UP IN HIGH SCHOOL / NOW YOU'VE COME SO FAR / THEN YOU STARTED TO HATE HIM / AND HIT HIM WITH YOUR CAR.
So you don't want to kill me anymore?	I love you, too.
Now I'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.	WHEN YOU TURN OUT THE LIGHT / I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO ME / LOOKS LIKE IT'S ME AND YOU AGAIN TONIGHT / MARJORIE.
Why you little...	Except a place to live and free food.
Now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to Marge!	Why you little...
You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean.	I want to thank you all so much.
Only teasing. We've flown in the finest busboys from France... I mean, America!	What?!
And now, to all my dear friends, I say... get the Hell out of my yard.	Vite! Vite!
I AM HOMER TRIBAL CHIEF / I AM WEARING TINY BRIEFS / BRAVES TEACH VALUE BOYS SHOULD KNOW / NOW EXTENDED DRUM SO-LO	Is it hyphenated?
I never knew you were such a Beatles fan.	Ned, I am so sorry.
It's not all his fault. I blame this latchkey kid.	I am so tired of that tautology.
Look at me, I'm Brian Epstein!	You are so right, Ned. There won't be a single minute where Bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... Homer, get over here!
Now I'm Michael Jackson. I own all your songs, losers. Hee, hee, hee.	Look at me, I'm Brian Epstein!
Five-H?	Here are some supervised activities we can all do together. Future Veterans of Foreign Wars, The 5-H Club...
"Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""Cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."""	You won't be seeing Milhouse for a while. Something about that boy just shakes up your soda. Ooh, this looks interesting: The Pre-Teen Braves.
You mean like some sort of madman?	Dad, maybe you could lead Bart's tribe.
I'll do it!	Ideally no, but...
I will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.	I'll do it!
Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War.	"I am ""Burger With Fries."" Man, is that uninspired."
The noble Chiefs outsmarted the treacherous Cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. Unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. I shall bet no more forever.	Hey, Lazy Horse! Find us something cool to do.
Without the talking stick, we don't hear you.	I smell smoke.
But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal.	Well, thank you. I'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible Pre-Teen Brave experience.
Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?	And now the land weeps.
Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth.	Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?
Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty.	"""We will crush you and smother your dreams. Yours in Christ, the Cavalry Kids."""
Oh, it's too tight! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!	Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty.
Men of cruelty.	Oh, it's too tight! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!
Okay, Bart. Back up the truck.	Men of cruelty.
It's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!	Get your un-poisoned candy!
Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?	Oh, the indignity!
Well I'm not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?	At least we made a lot of people sick.
Marge, remove that stitching.	It's on the back of our vests.
People will do anything a sign tells them.	VIP? That's us!
Boy, that slaked my thirst.	People will do anything a sign tells them.
Or did it?	Boy, that slaked my thirst.
You talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!	Pound him, Milhouse!
Oh my God, that's my wife, and she's crying.	All I wanted was to glue feathers on felt and teach the boys good citizenship. And now it's a donnybrook!
How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities?	C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower.
That's because there were seven apostles.	"Because I know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven."
Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny.	No, there were twelve.
Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.	The Venus Flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
Ooo, a hotdog!	Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal!	Dad, the traffic's moving.
Your baby!	My baby!
NOOOOOOOOOO!	Your baby!
Moe! Thank God you saved my baby...	Whaaa--?
Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute.	Heh. Life don't seem so hard no more.
Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them.	Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute.
Oh my God, I'm late for work.	Ain't she adorable.
It's Patty, chump!	Ball pit, that's nice. One, two, three colors -- you got 'em all.
Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!	Well, I have so much free time now that Moe's our babysitter.
No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back.	You could be my father figure.
I said, pipe down, Amtrak.	I can help you.
Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me.	Yeah, sure he was, Nahasapasa-Imraisin'apervert.
This is how we play. THE SQUIRMY WORMY SPIDER / SQUIRTS OUT OF DADDY'S HANDS...	Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me.
... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE.	You guys mind if I uh... kiss your tummies?
I recorded that for private use!	I peed my pants.
Your turn.	I recorded that for private use!
Moe?! What are you doing here?	I got it. It's okay!
That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore.	I had to. It's so weird watching the video and not getting any sound.
Get your own family, Moe.	Eh? Eh?
Get out!	"Hey, you never cared about Maggie 'til I started paying attention to her. Last night at the bar you called her ""Raquel."""
Get out!	"Is that uh, ""get out"" like leave, or ""get out"" as in: ""Get out. You banged Bridget Fonda?"""
Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own.	Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender.
It must have been Moe!	Maggie's gone!
Uh, no, that was me.	Well, it looks like Maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall.
I'll get our little passports.	Listen, I think we might have to make a trip to Little Italy.
Oh my God, I've gotta save her!	Maggie's right in the middle of that Italian-American-Mexican standoff!
We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya.	No, no, don't try to stop me.
Off you go.	We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya.
Or worse, am I right?	Thanks, Moe. I'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper.
Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham.	I don't think Maggie wants you out of her life, Moe.
Never!	Will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.	Never!
Death? We don't want any.	I am Death!
This is for Snowball One and JFK!	Your time is up, Bart Simpson.
Does this mean they'll never cancel the Jim Belushi Show?	Dad, do you realize what you've done? You've created a world without Death.
Nooooo!	I guess so.
Death, Death, we miss you so much. You were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. And you made NASCAR racing exciting.	That's why I'm up here.
I'll curb him... without enthusiasm.	Homer, it's trash day. Will you just take him out to the curb?
Ooo, this robe's pretty soft.	I'll curb him... without enthusiasm.
Check it out! I finally found a dead guy's clothes that fit me!	Ooo, this robe's pretty soft.
No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper.	Dad, you've become the new Grim Reaper!
Ow! I'll reap! I'll reap already!	No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper.
Jasper, your time has come!	Ow! I'll reap! I'll reap already!
Never mind. I'm Death now.	Where's the regular guy? Where's Doug?
Leave everything to me.	Oh man, these seats suck.
Pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... Take an dirt nap. Feed the worms...	Leave everything to me.
Hm.	Pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... Take an dirt nap. Feed the worms...
I'unno.	Dad, were all those people on the list?
Okay, who am I giving the finger to today?	I'unno.
Uh... what was that first one again?	Not this! Anything but this!
Come on!	No!
Woo-hoo!	All right.
I'm gonna not kill you every week.	Thanks for not killing me, Homie. Here's an extra pork chop.
Y'ello?	I'm gonna not kill you every week.
The Nobel Prize! Finally. So, uh it's for what, my whole deal?	Sir, I'm honored to inform you that you've won the Nobel Prize.
If I say no, do I still win?	This is Professor John Frink, isn't it?
I wish I was Death again. That was cool.	And I thought Halle Berry went nuts during her acceptance speech.
It was those guys!	Behold the perpetrators!
Just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?	Why is Bart so tall? And shaggy?
Let the baby have her bottle.	Why can't I tinker with the fabric of existence?
Lisa!	What happens if I press this button?
Okay, that's good! Stop there!	Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room!	Don't go inside -- it's a trap!
Whom? Whom?	"""Mayor unveils erection to cheering crowd."" This week's ""Oops Patrol"" T-shirt goes to..."
Bart, you're not at school. Don't swear!	Mom made the Oops Patrol! Hot damn!
Honey, this is your moment in the sun. And I couldn't be more pleased for your happiness.	It could always be a little better.
Why was I born?	Honey, this is your moment in the sun. And I couldn't be more pleased for your happiness.
Oh T-shirt. Bless the loom that fruited you.	Why was I born?
Okay, get ready to laugh!	Gotta win a T-shirt. Gotta win a T-shirt.

Too soon, huh?	"""Cranford Man Missing."" What's he missing? His pants? A train? Gimme a break!"
"All right. ""Drought threatens to turn west into dessert""? Yum, yum. I think I'd like some whipped cream on my Wyoming!"	Too soon, huh?
From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? C'mon Bart, show me some love!	"Dad, the word's ""desert."" And those farmers are suffering!"
This is what happens when I go for six hours without sleep.	Don't drag me down with you, old man.
"""Peace talks break down."" No. ""For sale, Ford Festiva..."" I'll put that in the ""maybes."" I gotta get that T-shirt."	This is what happens when I go for six hours without sleep.
World's Biggest Pizza?!	"""Peace talks break down."" No. ""For sale, Ford Festiva..."" I'll put that in the ""maybes."" I gotta get that T-shirt."
Oh my God!	World's Biggest Pizza?!
Marge, wake up! The newspaper is talking to me!	Oh my God!
I wish! Look at this headline.	Oh, relax. I'm sure it's just your brain going crazy.
"Someone, or something, knows I love oversized food and short, punchy articles. So they hid a message in the first letter of each line. See: ""HOMER, MEET ME 4TH STREET OVERPASS, MIDNITE."""	I wish! Look at this headline.
Wait a minute. This is today's paper. That meeting is tonight!	"Someone, or something, knows I love oversized food and short, punchy articles. So they hid a message in the first letter of each line. See: ""HOMER, MEET ME 4TH STREET OVERPASS, MIDNITE."""
Marge, I don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut.	Don't tell me you're actually going.
All right, I will.	You always go with your gut. This time, why don't you listen to your brain?
That's why I don't listen to my brain. And away we go!	All right, I will.
You have no choice.	No.
There's coffee in the thermos.	You have no choice.
They all do.	This is boring. Can't we go home? This overpass smells like urine.
Hey, the bathroom's a block away.	Fresh urine.
Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck.	Yes'm.
Give me a hug, you.	Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck.
I know! I'm working my way up to you.	Homer, you're hugging a bum.
I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.	Sorry about all the cloak and dagger Homer, but the government is still after me for what I did in the sixties. They're probably tapping your phones and reading your mail.
You sure know me, Mom.	To reach you, I called up my friends in the liberal media and planted that story about the giant pizza.
I made this when I was five. I had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.	I saw this macaroni pencil-holder Homer made me, and I realized how much I missed him.
Cora, is there a back way outta here?	Oh.
Fine.	Not for someone who tips nine per cent.
Mom, I swear on your eventual grave I will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. Uh-oh.	Right through there, Santa Claus.
Now, I'm not a man who's good with words...	I'm sorry, my wife left me this morning.
I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me.	You gotta say somethin', she's lookin' at twenty years. And my legal license expires in fifteen minutes.
I mean, I'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. Hell, I torched a blood bank. One cookie my ass! Please, please, give me back my mommy.	I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me.
Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!	The jets in the whirlpool anticipated my every move. When it was working. And three dollars for a local call? They should be the ones on trial!
Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!	Well, now that I'm free, I intend to be a better mother to my son.
A boy who gets some on the side.	Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!
Dad, you testified against her!	Oh, baby! Now you're free to come back to me!
Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!	I read a book that said women like jerks.
You weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it.	Homer, this really isn't necessary.
Hey guys, I brought my Mom.	Wah, wah, wah. Ain't I cute? You owe me a dirt bike.
Welcome to your room, Mom. I want you to stay here forever.	Mrs. Simpson, when you took off, you left a hole in Homer's heart that he's been trying to fill with alcohol for twenty years... God bless ya.
Now get out of my house.	Oh well, you snooze you lose. But uh, can I have my photo albums back?
No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!	Anita Bong-hitt?
How do you figure?	Dad, I'm just as sad as you are. What happened to Grandma is an outrage.
You're right. People should only be let out of jail on technicalities.	She was acquitted. Then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
Candlepin bowling? That's a great idea. We'll play right after I break your grandmother out of prison.	Well, they're transferring Grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. I say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!
Okay, boy. Flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus.	I hope this bus ride never ends. 'Cause I'm gettin' executed when I get off.
Next.	Okay, boy. Flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus.
Pass.	Next.
Bo-ring.	Pass.
Awww.	Bo-ring.
Haw haw, loser!	Awww.
Geez, pal.	Haw haw, loser!
Mom, I love you! I can't let you go to prison!	Homer! What on Earth are you doing?
Oh, stop it.	He's a big one!
Take care, ladies. I'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own.	Oh, stop it.
Mom, I'm gonna hide you where there's no one around for miles... Disney's California Adventure.	You're like the son I never killed.
No, you're my mother and I won't leave you!	Homer, get out now and no one will ever know you were involved.
Yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. But I'm not gonna leave you.	If you stay here, you'll be abandoning your family the way I abandoned you.
Brambles! Briars!	Ooh, that's lucky.
Go Mom! You can do it!	Pipe down, Jules Verne.
Nooo!	Go Mom! You can do it!
Bear?!	Mona, I'll always remember raspberry trolley cars... because my mind is shot.
Your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. But at least now I'll never lose you again.	Bear?!
I couldn't sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body.	Homer, it's two in the morning.
Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?	Then what was in the coffin?
"""I-M-O--,i-m-o--,1
91096,315,285,Homer Simpson: --K"". Get it? ""I am OK."""	Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?
Ooh boy, casino night! Finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six.	We had lunch at a lovely diner. They had clam chowder... Rhode Island style! I never knew there was such a thing. And the crackers kept on coming...
Aw Marge, I bet you've gotten that out of your system.	I really shouldn't be here -- I have a problem with games of chance. I played Candyland with Maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.	That was always on too late for me.
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!	I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.
Woo-hoo!	Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
I win!	And the winner is, seventeen!
This is it, baby. First thing tomorrow, we're getting a Playstation One!	I win!
But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!	I'll be bringin' sparkplugs to chuck at people I don't like. Like you!
You think I won't manhandle a little boy?!	But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!	I can't beat Nelson.
Oh, what a delicious quiche! I drive a pink Miata.	Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!
La, la, la...	I can't believe Nelson is more popular than me.
My name is Nelthon! I use a thalad fork. La-dee-dah! I wash my face!	No, I'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options...
Clothesline.	Where did you get that tutu?
I wish I'd married a businessman. Then I'd have nice things.	Lisa, you look so successful. Like you're the wife of a businessman.
Oh, I'm so confused.	No. I was being sincere.
On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars.	Lis, Skinner is using you. Like a pawn on his unholy chess set.
Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps.	They made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...	Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps.
Squeak, squeak, squeak. No, don't kiss me.	There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...
No way! I'm saving for a speedboat!	Would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!	Well, I guess this story has a happy ending after all. Just like my last massage.
Why can't you have a normal dream, like being an Olympic figure skater?	But this is my dream.
Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!	Okay, let me take figure skating.
I'unno. How 'bout a horse whisperer?	Well, what can I be?
Over my dead body!	Okay.
One thousand dollars. Do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?	The best you'll ever have.
Well, we put up a flyer.	Marge, this is why people don't tell you things.
You know the drill. Try to land on my back-fat.	Uh-oh.
Can you describe the bill?	You know the drill. Try to land on my back-fat.
IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...	No one's touching the hors d'oeuvres.
What?	IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...
We've gone on plenty of great vacations.	Well... someday I'd like to go on a nice vacation.
I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.	Yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and I don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon.
Well, I'd like to return to Brazil. But I hear the monkey problem is even worse now.	Well... okay. For Mom, I'll do it. Where should we go?
Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?	That sounds great -- But only if your father promises to behave.
Would an American dollar encourage you to leave us alone?	Because I want to encourage all the world to come see the beauty of twenty-first century Britain.
The place I was born is now a gator farm.	There's so much to see here: Parliament, Stratford-on-Avon, the white cliffs of Dover... Oh, and you Americans love castles -- there's a huge one in Edinburgh, the city where I was born.
Wow. I can't believe we met Mr. Bean.	I'd love to, but I'm late for an appointment. I'm greeting a lovely Dutch couple at Gate 23. Cheerio.
Make with the tea, Jeeves.	Actually, I'm not a butler. I had already hired this cab when you got in, but the more the merrier and all that.
We're bigshot tourists from everyone's favorite country: the USA. We saved your ass in Vietnam and shared our prostitutes with Hugh Grant. So give me some free maps, and none of that dry British wit.	Yes, very good, sir.
Thank you.	I wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Aw Dad, I wish there was something I could do.	I don't know if I'm ever gonna find her.
Touch that mini bar and you're dead!	Aw Dad, I wish there was something I could do.
Fish? I don't know, I'm not really a vegetarian...	"Now completely free of ""Mad Fish Disease."""
Well, Marge, you've gotta admit. I've been on my best behavior this trip.	Blimey.
That was over soccer results! Can you believe they gave Giggs a yellow card in the box?	You punched out three people on the street.
"I understand the word ""gave."" Unless it means something else in this country."	Do you understand any part of what you just said?
Now, now, let's just look... there's Big Ben, there's Piccadilly Circus, there's Jimmy Page, one of the greatest thieves of American black music who ever walked the earth. Bup, there's the kids.	Homie, I don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here.
You can't bet on my kids. This is America, pal!	It's a bet, Lord Daftwager.
What? What play?	Thank you, my dear. Please take these free tickets to my play.
"You mean ""Macbeth""?"	We thespians believe it's bad luck to mention the name of this particular play out loud.
"What? By saying ""Macbeth""?"	Quiet, you blundering fool. You'll curse us all!
Saying what?	Stop saying it!
Mr. Macbeth, I'm really sorry.	Mom, you said Macbeth!
But please, find it in your jewel-encrusted heart to forgive me.	Mr. Macbeth, I'm really sorry.
Yes, this trip is entirely uneventful.	Homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. This is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever.
I see an opening.	Turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning...
That's it. I'm acting the way America acts best -- unilaterally.	No, it's too risky! We'll just wait till the traffic thins out. Turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning...
Okay, let's see. Oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire...	Okay, I'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool.
Lady, please. Get back in your overturned car. Let the guys handle this.	Okay, let's see. Oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire...
Your Majesty?	We'll deal with him, your Majesty.
The Queen of whaaa?!	Dad, you rear-ended the Queen of England!
Wait! We have to exchange insurance!	Changing of the guard!
Back cuts?	Homer Simpson, you are hereby charged with damaging the Royal Coach, and putting several dents in the Royal Horse. How do you plead?
My Lord, we Americans love queens, be they homecoming or Dairy. This woman, however, is an imposter.	Back cuts?
"Her luggage is inscribed ""H.R.H."" -- which means her real name must be... Henrietta R. Hippo."	My Lord, we Americans love queens, be they homecoming or Dairy. This woman, however, is an imposter.
Your Honor, I've completely disappointed my wife. That's punishment enough. You understand these things, you're a grandmother.	I guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
Ohh, and a very manly one, if I may say so, m'lord.	I'm a man!
Boy, she's good. If she were a hundred years younger... and I were a hundred years older...	I haven't had an easy life. I've seen my country ravaged by war, my family torn by tragedy and then, as I was innocently making my way to the shops to buy light bulbs, I was blindsided by this great lumbering brute.
America rules! Our Beatles are way better than your precious Rolling Stones!	If there's any love left in you for me, destroy him.
Oh Marge, I Am so sorry. I should've listened to whatever it was you were saying.	Poke the monster with a stick! Tuppence a jab! C'mon, queue up, lads.
Well Marge, if I die here, there's one thing I want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in England. They won't work in our VCR!	"Hey, Dad, why don't we try the ""Sprawl-Mart""?"
"Dear God of England: please let me go. In return I will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and I'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, I can't do it. It's so stupid!"	Well Marge, if I die here, there's one thing I want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in England. They won't work in our VCR!
A secret tunnel? I don't know. Won't that get me in more trouble?	We found a secret tunnel out of the tower. It was used by Sir Walter Raleigh!
Okay, what do I do?	Smash it on, don't worry it. Let the pike do the work.
Sweet freedom, here I--	Push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
Boy, it's a good thing I'm leaving before I went nuts. Goodbye Sparkly Elves.	Put out the fire first.
Boy, a Krispy Kreme would really clean up down here.	Yes, Bart. An elephant's butt.
Hey, this place is amazing. It's fit for a Duke, or even an Earl...	Boy, a Krispy Kreme would really clean up down here.
Please, your Majesty, I know that I, like many other Americans, have behaved like a total buffoon.	And you didn't want to give her a whistle!
But we Americans are England's children. I know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother Canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, I'm just sayin'.	Please, your Majesty, I know that I, like many other Americans, have behaved like a total buffoon.
Only my hairdresser knows for sure.	But we Americans are England's children. I know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother Canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, I'm just sayin'.
See ya in Atlanta, jerk!	Englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
Lady, you're gorgeous. You make Dame Edna look like a dude!	Mummy, he's everything you said he was.
Okay, Mother's Day gift check. Let's see what you got.	Why, thank you. You're all right, luv.
Flow... yeah.	Flowers.
Bart, we made her the same thing!	Lis, your stupid present will only last a week. Mine will sit in a closet for years.
Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years.	This is even worse than you think -- look!
Let's see, what would she like?	Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years.
Twenty on the trifecta?	Let's see, what would she like?
Her wedding china back?	Twenty on the trifecta?
Yeah, I love Sprawl-Mart. They've got everything. Even Christian videos with talking vegetables.	I could get Marge a new window, just like this one.
Mmm, Moses.	Mighty Yamses, we are weary of building your food pyramid. Let my pickles go!
How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?	Grampa! You have a job?
Yeah, it's impressive. But I still haven't found the perfect gift for Marge. Only imperfect stuff for me.	Oh look, Jaclyn Smith has her own line of axe heads!
Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but you slags are all right.	Endorsed by the American Carny Association.
Marge, you're gonna love my present. It is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap.	All this attention! I feel like a secretary on Administrative Professionals Day!
Whoa, Marge, get a room!	"""Kitchen Carnival?"" I love it! Thank you, Homie."
Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy?	Whoa, Marge, get a room!
This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!	What is that?!
That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball.	This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!
That's my old lady.	Homer, are you spooning that snack?
Ants!	That's my old lady.
Birds!	Ants!
Cats!	Birds!
Flanderses!	Cats!
Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge.	I think you should get rid of her. Then we can be together... forever!
Goodbye, old friend. I'll think of you whenever I have a stroke or a heart attack.	Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge.
Smooth.	Oh my God, I'm gonna be killed by a bear! Well, I guess I don't have to worry anymore about the dangers of smoking.
Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it.	Homie! What happened to you?
I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape.	Dad, you got attacked by a bear?!
Choke on your candor!	Yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day.
It's a deal!	You can strangle Bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation.
Marge? Maggie?	Hello? Anyone home?
Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears...	"""The Bear Went Over The Mountain""?! ""The Berenstain Bears""?! Ahhh, Goldilocks... and the Three Bears!"
Are you a Care Bear?	Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears...
Why does a bear need a crowbar?	I'm an intensive care bear.
No, go ahead.	Crying in the corner huh? Mind if I join you?
Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?	All right. That's enough, Fraidy Sue. Here's what you gotta do: find that bear what whupped you, and whup him back.
You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again.	Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
But how will I find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?	You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again.
Finally, science has joined forces with revenge.	It tracks an electronic tag I stuck in the bear's ear. It's the same technology they use to keep tabs on Gary Busey.
Lookin' good. And I did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.	Now, listen. The bull grizzly is seven feet tall, weighs more than a Mazda Miata, and can tear through a tree like a Jewish mother through self-esteem. Next time you face him, you better have some way to protect yourself.
Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack.	Oh, dear Lord.
I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit.	Homer, there's no rear on that thing.
Rub a dub dub, I'm washin' the blub.	I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit.
What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?	Now look here, mister. I forbid you to fight a bear.
"Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is ""be yourself."""	Dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. That's the whole point of Moby Dick.
Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?	You're not going, and that's final.
Marge, you awake? Marge?	Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him.	Or dead.
No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name.	You're sneakin' out to fight that bear. I wanna go too.
That is so cool. All right, you can come.	Screw that. When I grow up, I'm legally changing my name to Joe Kickass.
I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust!	I just wanted to see what it was like. Howdy, y'all. If you don't like mah song, I'll spray ya with ink!
Suh-weet.	Why don't you take a bath in the river? This bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
Oh my God! Lenny! Carl! Bart?	SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT / AFTERNOON DELIGHT...
I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man.	Ma'am, I will find your husband before that bear kills him. But first, a snack.
Is this thing hurting you?	I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man.
Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug.	Okay, it's probably the tag. But just to be sure...
Jeez! I don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.	Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug.
Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!	That's funny.
He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.	Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!
Wrong again, liberal media.	A killer bear is on the loose in Springfield Forest, and local laughingstock Homer Simpson is missing and presumed mauled.
Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe.	A bounty has been placed on the rogue bear in the amount of ten thousand dollars.
Hold on. Something doesn't feel right.	Okay, you wanna go over there.
They're looking for a male bear, right?	All right, all right I'm still thinking!
What can I say? I love nature...	You set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
Circle of life.	What can I say? I love nature...
BAH-DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH...	Circle of life.
TIME TO WHIZ IN A FOAMING BOWL OF CHINA...	BAH-DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH...
A line for the bathroom? What gives?	TIME TO WHIZ IN A FOAMING BOWL OF CHINA...
Son, can I have cuts?	I don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time.
Sweet.	Okay.
Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.	Maggie's locked inside!
Oh God, it's baby blood!	Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
The door? Now I'll never get to pee.	I tried the coat hanger again. I don't understand why we only try ideas once.
You just lost a box, pal!	Oh well, I'm glad you think they're cute, 'cause they're your problem now.
Yeah, well uh, funny thing about that...	We did -- Homer took him. Didn't you?
On our way to the clinic, I decided to give him a night his wang would never forget.	Yeah, well uh, funny thing about that...
Wanna play some air hockey?	On our way to the clinic, I decided to give him a night his wang would never forget.
You're on!	Three hundred and fifty dollars an hour.
I can't neuter you, boy. Not after all we've been through.	You're on!
But from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!	I can't neuter you, boy. Not after all we've been through.
You broke our deal -- we had an oral contract!	But from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!
I'm your man!	...and so utterly repellant he...
Welcome to the Homer Simpson Show. I'm your host, Next Card. Homer Simpson it's great to be here in Next Card. Springfield my guests are...Moe Szyslak, local businessman, Carl Carlson, raconteur, and Lenny Leonard, three-time juror. Gentlemen, what's on your minds?	Now tonight's guest host... the ultimate place-holder... Homer Simpson!
Ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? Theaters... airplanes... why even here. Look!	Dad, you have to say something. Something meaningful!
Who has more power? Miss America or Miss U.S.A.?	Yeah, yeah, twins, I get it. Now let's watch something I'm really interested in.
Why so formal, Lenny? You're my go-to guy.	Uh, listen Homer. I'd like to raise an issue.
Interesting...	About that, you know I've been with the show from the beginning and I was uh... I was wondering if I could get a small cost-of-living raise?
Please welcome new panelist, Barney Gumbel.	Interesting...
Please welcome my newest panelist, Disco Stu.	That light's a little bright. Do you think they could move it?
My pleasure.	Ah, Simpson, I hate to bother you when you're eating, but you're always eating. Will you sign an autograph for my boy?
So did I, son. And look where I am today.	I eat Legos.
Boy, everybody loves my show.	So did I, son. And look where I am today.
Yes, you're right...	It's great, Dad. You have tremendous power. And now it's time to put it to use.
Duck, Mr. Lincoln!	Yes, you're right...
Well, I took Bart's advice last week, so I guess it's Lisa's turn. Now, if you'll excuse me...	I say live fast, die young, and leave a big fat corpse.
You hit him high, I'll hit him low!	Well, I took Bart's advice last week, so I guess it's Lisa's turn. Now, if you'll excuse me...
"Y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects."	Okay, how 'bout you televise my Bar Mitzvah? Live! Please... you people are known for taking chances on crap.
Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues.	Boobs. Just like what girls got.
Every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. Yet, the IMF insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules.	Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues.
Why should America consume ninety percent of the world's resources? Argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!	Bar-chu et adonai hamvorach fool...
You can't leave, I'm your ride home!	Why should America consume ninety percent of the world's resources? Argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
I'll audience you!	Dad, you blew it. You listened to Lisa. And then you lost your stranglehold on the audience.
Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me.	Oh, Homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. I'm proud of you.
Hey, where's my car?	Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me.
Will you make my sundae for me?	"Come on, Homie. We'll go to the ""Make Your Own Sundae"" place."
I'm hungry. Are they married yet?	... ha.mo.shel be.khol-a.sher-lo sim-na yad.kha ta.khat ...
Then whose garter is this?	They're not getting married!
I love the holiday season.	The real Kent is in a rehab clinic. We all wish him the best -- again.
See you in spring, toes!	I love the holiday season.
Oh my God! A DVD player.	Hey, Homer -- I'm your Secret Santa. Merry Christmas, big guy.
Oh Carl, you remembered I like TV!	And the first season of Magnum P.I. with commentary by John Hillerman. Apparently, working in Hawaii was a pleasure.
Oh yes, I am... your present is right in the other room.	I think it's Homer.
Come on machine, take my dollar!	Oh yes, I am... your present is right in the other room.
Fine, we'll play it your way.	Come on machine, take my dollar!
Here you go, Lenny.	Fine, we'll play it your way.
May the spirit of Retsin be with you all year long. God bless God, amen.	Here you go, Lenny.
Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.	Homer, you're the most selfish man I know.
That evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass Smithers...	Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.
Joe DiMaggio?	"All right, everyone. It's time for your Christmas ""boni."" Everyone gets a five dollar cafeteria voucher...and for your boy, a confectioner's card featuring a current baseballer. It's that rookie from the New York Nine."
I need money for Christmas... can I get anything for this Joe DiMaggio baseball card? It's kinda old.	Excellent.
Thank you! Freak.	Deftly.
Hey, everybody! We're going shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade!	This is offensive to Christians and prunes.
First we'll buy gifts for each other. Then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a Christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding.	That's a very violent image, Lisa.
Doing pretty good so far. A key ring for Marge, key ring for Bart...	Stand back when you open it.
That thing for me.	Doing pretty good so far. A key ring for Marge, key ring for Bart...
Oh God, it's so unnecessary!	That thing for me.
I'm upside down so much!	It also comes with a notepad and a pen that works upside down.
Oh, if I buy this, I won't have anything left for a Christmas tree...	I'm upside down so much!
That's the birthday I'm always forgetting. I must have it!	Today is the birthday of comedienne Margaret Cho.
Uh, sure, you know it. The biggest tree from the finest lot in town!	Can we get our big Christmas tree now?
It's fine. Everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio.	Dad, I don't like the looks of this neighborhood.
Exactly.	Colombia's main export is coffee.
Gorgeous, huh? And quite the bargain.	TEN-FOUR KING OF THE JEWS!
Oh, it just needs a little love.	Isn't it kind of dry?
Why do the things I love always burn?	Oh, it just needs a little love.
Isn't it sufficient.	Why do the things I love always burn?
Uh... Woo hoo! Maggie's talking!	What's that?
There's a trickle-down theory here. If I'm happy, I'm less abusive to the rest of you.	You wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
"Oh, this is sadder than ""Tuesdays With Morrie."""	I will be testing my smoke alarm for the next three hours.
"C'mon Marge, I'm not the only selfish person. You have to get your hair done at ""Supercuts."" I guess regular ""Cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."	"Oh, this is sadder than ""Tuesdays With Morrie."""
That's not true. I cared what you thought once you found out.	You just don't get it, do you? Christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself.
Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?	You can sleep on the couch tonight.
Jimmy Stewart as a puppet is just wrong.	Santa was in an awful pickle. Beatniks had given drugs to the reindeer and they were no darn good. So Santa placed a call to Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird...
Mr. McGrew! I love that blind, senile old man.	"And now back to ""Mr. McGrew's Christmas Carol."""
I heard you the first five times.	I can't find my way back to the home.
Oh my God! It's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.	Sweet, sweet money!
C'mon, Death. Leave McGrew alone. Take Tiny Tim.	Spirit, surely there is some time to reform my selfish ways.
Unloved by Al? Noooooooo!	Nooooooo!
Unloved by all! Noooooooo!	Unloved by Al? Noooooooo!
Children, children, what day is this?	Dad? Are you okay?
Thank God! There's still four more days 'til Christmas. I have time to reform my ways!	It's Saturday, December sixth.
I just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. It was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at Christmas. And get this: he learns a lesson!	Thank God! There's still four more days 'til Christmas. I have time to reform my ways!
Marge, TV and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. From now on, I will stop being selfish and start being good. In fact, I'll be the nicest man in town.	That last one looked kinda good.
Yes, but this time I'm sober. Ish.	You've made that promise before.
No need, Flanders. I've already given them my old clothes.	Well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans.
Good-lookin' group.	No need, Flanders. I've already given them my old clothes.
You're welcome!	These pants smell worse than my old pants.
Look, Lenny. I know I was a pretty bad Secret Santa, so I wanted to make it up to you.	You're welcome!
And I filed down all the sharp corners. See, your eye is completely safe.	Wow, a photo cube with pictures of us!
Marge, do you want this last pork chop?	Oh, wow, it just stings a little!
All right, now you're startin' to creep me out.	Oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. And tears are the sweetest sauce.
I'm not looking for glory or wealth. I'm just buying that stairway to heaven Jesus sang of.	Oh, very nice, Ned. But I'm afraid you're a distant second this week.
Get back to your bong, hippie.	That was Led Zeppelin.
Just like the Pope!	Homie, I'm so proud -- you changed more than I could imagined! You're even covering your mouth when you burp.
Being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner.	Just like the Pope!
And here's another act of Christian charity I pulled out of my butt.	Being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner.
I built a skating rink for the whole town!	And here's another act of Christian charity I pulled out of my butt.
Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots.	Wha?
Ewww.	Those are my feet.
Pathetic Flanders. Thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.	Stay out of our medicine cabinet!
I'll show Flanders. I'm gonna get everyone a car. What's that one good American car?	You just tweezered my wang.
Uh... is it despair?	Dad, you don't have to out-do Mr. Flanders. Just remember the spirit of the season.
Hmm. You've given me a lot to think about.	Actually, most people now feel Christmas has gotten too materialistic. In fact, as a Buddhist, I believe people would be a lot happier without presents.
I've got it... when everyone's asleep, I'll take away their presents. Then they'll be happy! Thanks, Buddha.	I'm not going to jail again!
YOU'RE A HERO, HOMER J. / YOU'RE AS CRAFTY AS A SKUNK / THEY'LL THANK YOU IN THE MORNING FOR STEALING FLANDERS' JUNK / HOMER JAAAAAY! / You're a double-bacon genius-burger... AND JUST A LITTLE DRUNK.	I got your badge number! You better hope I never get out.
Now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on Christmas to discover they have no presents.	YOU'RE A HERO, HOMER J. / YOU'RE AS CRAFTY AS A SKUNK / THEY'LL THANK YOU IN THE MORNING FOR STEALING FLANDERS' JUNK / HOMER JAAAAAY! / You're a double-bacon genius-burger... AND JUST A LITTLE DRUNK.
They don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude.	He didn't leave, he went to the store. And when he comes back I'll wave those Pop-Tarts right in your face.
Um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?	Your behavior, it's like, it's like, not sanctioned by any governing body. You're like, wild.
Wait a minute, everyone! There's your Christmas up there!	Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts.
Let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. But we're probably right. Amen.	You can't pray on city property.
And now, I think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! Ned?	Amen.
Look, Maggie! Funny Daddy!	NINE, TEN, START OVER AGAIN. ONE, TWO, TIE YOUR SHOE....
Too hard.	Look, Maggie! Funny Daddy!
Give Daddy the remote, Maggie. Give daddy the...	ME...
Nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh.	Oh. Wise guy, eh?
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!	I got them fair and square and I kept my dignity. Not like Janey's mom.
Then why did you appear in it?	That ad makes me look like a criminal.
Maybe she was you and you're not! How many kids do we have?	That wasn't me!
Wrong, lady! Oh wait, the baby.	Three!
Honey, this marriage is a partnership. When you fall, I pick you up. And when you can't finish a sandwich, I eat that sandwich.	I try my best. They ridicule me. They mock everything I cherish.
And I promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.	You're my rock, Homie.
Honey, no one messes with my Mrs. I'll come down on those guys like the garage door on Bart's bike.	Awww...
You just leave everything to Homer. And now, I believe you owe me half a sandwich.	What are you going to do?
Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four...	I always keep one near the bed for you.

Great. Let's dump these kids in an R-rated movie while we go someplace nice.	"And the bumper stickers misspelled ""on""."
Marge, wait.	I need to be alone right now.
I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am.	Marge, wait.
What do I care?	Can I bring my laser pointer?
Bart, that creepy kid's here!	I ran here as fast as I...
A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?	Oh man, I sure wish I had a ten-speed bike.
I'm confused! Which is it?	I said no!
Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works.	It's no! His old bike is fine!
That's right. No questions asked.	I see. So if my old bike didn't work, I would automatically get a new one?
There, there. You're both right.	I know how you feel, Lis. No kid wants to outlive their pet.
Son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?	There, there. You're both right.
For true, son.	Can I, for true?
Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.	Your bike is in here. I could put it together right now -- for a small assembly fee.
I'll assemble it myself.	Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
I can make a bike. I made you.	Dad, no! Think of the bike.
Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day.	Yeah, great workmanship.
Oh man, this is so confusing.	Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day.
What the Hell is this?	Oh man, this is so confusing.
Bike's over there.	What the Hell is this?
Son are you okay? I brought my home-made first aid kit. It's spring-loaded for quick access!	Haw haw! Your dad's not handy!
First of all, thank you. Secondly...	Face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. But you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. That's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news.
"There's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""Dad I don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."""	Welcome to the family, Snowball III!

Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me?	Why... do... I... suck?

Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag.	Awesome! I gotta tell Milhouse.

"""...I'd love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad."	Dear Bart...
Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...	What's this? Knockahomer has dropped his hammer.
Pretended.	...then Knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!
Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.	Dad, what are all those cuts?
I like you, son.	Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!
Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now.	I like you, son.
Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank.	This robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. I can't believe you've never seen him fight.
I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think.	Well, the next match is Saturday. Can you come then?
So much metal in my eye.	I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think.
Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!	Our robot can kick that robot's ass! Right Dad? Dad?
There are many people I'd like to thank for this award. My wife, Anjelica Huston -- this is for you, Angie! We did it!	Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!
Listen son, there's something I have to tell you about our robot.	Sure he's tough. But he's never come up against a wooden mallet!
Uh...	You guys are just in time. My dad's about to tell me something important about our robot.
I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!	Uh...
I wish I had bullies like you growing up.	Don't worry, I'll raise him like the mean streets raised me.
You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!	My job was to keep Lisa's hope alive. But instead, she's really depressed.
The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?	Business, what business?
Can you do my back?	The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?
Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud.	Dad?!
Affirmative.	So, you fought all those robots?
You really think so?	That is so cool!
And I'm the luckiest--	Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! I am the luckiest kid in the world.
Hey, what gives? He's not killing me!	That robot has given birth to a man!
He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol.	I'll tell you what gives, I'm afraid he is subject to Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics. With the sci-fi and the so many books, not too many good. My robot is programmed never to harm humans, you see, only to serve them.
Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside.	Go! Go! Go! Now's your chance!
Keep me focused.	Why did you make it do that?
Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable.	Well, you did disappear a lot, but I have gone whole summers without seeing you.
Let's see... I'll have sixteen gravy scrape 'ems, a bucket of twisty lard, and two super-choker breakfast burritos with macho sauce. And mega-size it, please.	Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable.
Great. And I'll have a diet coke. Deep fried.	I could also deep-fry the bag.
Hmm... need more lap.	Great. And I'll have a diet coke. Deep fried.
Why don't I just pull over?	I can't see! I'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!
It's stuck! Krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!	Why don't I just pull over?
Oh no! I hit the grief counselor!	Yes, we're well-protected against every threat, from bomb-toting Bolsheviks, to golden-armed jazzbos.
I had a car!	Consider yourself fired!
I gotta get a job before Marge finds out I was fired.	Then I'll do it!
That's it! I'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!	I gotta get a job before Marge finds out I was fired.
We'll clean out those stupid Americans.	Okay, here's how it goes: buyers never tell you what they're willing to spend. And when they talk privately, we spy on them through this one-way mirror.
"...you probably want to talk this over, so I'll leave you two ""alone."" Excuse me."	We'll clean out those stupid Americans.
They'll be back.	Let's get outta here. I'm not shaking that guy's hand.
He was my best friend.	They'll be back.
Cool, an ambulance from the '60s! I bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. Injured hippies!	He was my best friend.
I'll do it!	Buy me! Buy me! Buy me! Buy me!
Guess what? I quit my job as a used car salesman.	Do what?
Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!	You work at the nuclear plant.
Maybe on planet ZooZoo.	Don't you need training for that?
Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake.	Not if I pump your heart full of morphine first!
I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.	Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake.
Slow down, Picasso! You were gonna start a novel without informing me?	Tonight? But I was hoping you could watch the kids while I work on my novel.
I also fed some ducklings.	Homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call.
Fine, fine. I'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment.	I know -- I got your message.
Whatever. But I think you look great already.	I'm writing a novel!
Where to, Mack?	Perfect! Now, let's see if lightning strikes twice!
Hospital, eh? Wow, everyone's goin' there tonight.	For the third time, the hospital. You're an ambulance, not a taxi!
Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?	Why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
Marge, I'm back!	Was there ever a more perfect husband than you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons.	Oh Homie, I've had the most exciting day...
I'll say.	We're not paramedics!
Oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice.	I'll say.
Marge! We're out of bath towels.	I suppose I better. Your father's a very private person.
Ooh, ice cream truck!	Marge! We're out of bath towels.
HERE IN MY CAR / I AM HOSING OFF BLOOD / SOME OF IT'S MINE / BUT MOST OF IT'S NOT / HERE'S MARGE...	Ooh, ice cream truck!
Ooh, typed!	Homie, I finished my novel.
No problem.	It's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
Two hundred and eighty-six pages!	No problem.
Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!	It's double-spaced.
"All right, ""Chapter One."" Hm, that makes sense. ""There once was a girl from Nantucket..."" Good, good... ""Her name was Temperance Barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. She..."""	Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!
"No! Gotta read Marge's book. Can't get distracted. Hm... ""distracted,"" that's a funny word. Does anyone ever get ""tracted?"" Let me call the suicide hotline and ask them."	"All right, ""Chapter One."" Hm, that makes sense. ""There once was a girl from Nantucket..."" Good, good... ""Her name was Temperance Barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. She..."""
Well what?	Well?
Oh, yes.	Did you read the book?
I did.	Did you like it?
No! They were all in their own way totally awesome.	Oh that's wonderful. And the characters didn't bother you at all?
"As I've always said: ""publish or perish""!"	And you're fine with me trying to get it published?
So, how much bleach did you drink? Not a talker, eh?	We're doomed.
Apu, do you sell Crazy Straws? I've got a guy with a broken back and I'm tryin' to cheer him up.	"Can you believe that Homer and Marge's marriage is just a sham? All right, I'll order. Um, I'll have a medium pepperoni. And can you space out the meat so it spells ""happy birthday Moe""? Oh, God I'm alone."
What are you talking about?	Oh Mr. Homer, anything for a cuckolded boob, I mean, loyal customer.
Why do you keep talking that way?!	"Nothing, nothing. It just seems your wife has an ""active imagination."""
Well, then maybe I will.	You'll see when you read your wife's book.
That one I got.	If you do you'll see she lusts for Flanders.
"I'll have to read Marge's book. And I swore never to read again after ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. It did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"	This is how you talk when you learn English from porno movies.

And I swore never to read again after ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds.

How can you write such horrible things about me?	"""The Harpooned Heart II: Thunder Down Under."" Chapter One. Temperance Barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie..."
I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.	You told me you liked it! You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!
Just tell me how much of this is true!	I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.
I knew it! And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?	Well... there is a place called Nantucket.
Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again.	It was only my imagination.
Flanders!	Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again.
Open this door right now!	Flanders!
Flanders, pull over! I'm an ambulance!	"""As Temperance watched the two men she had loved and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean, she realized it was... the end."""
Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago.	Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box.
Would you help me be a better husband?	Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago.
In Marge's book I was so mean and you were so nice. How can I be more like you? Just give me some advice.	Huh?
Uh-huh.	Advice? Just call me Ann Flanders!
Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good.	...and a backrub can just be a backrub. It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book.	Oh, Homie! You're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book.
Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own.	That's the best review I've gotten. Seriously. These reviews are terrible.
Marge, I've got it all figured out: Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal the Jack Ruby.	Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own.
All right, we're back to square one. Put on some coffee.	Jack Ruby was a man, not a jewel.

That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina.	Attention American bar devils: it's our anniversary! Free drinks for everyone!
You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up.	That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina.
These charity address labels that came in the mail.	What did you plan to get your wife, Homer?
I don't wanna go home! I'm not done talking to me!	I'm bored. Let's go switch the heads on the Cosby Kids.
Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.	Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem. If you make it through the night, you're welcome back.
Five bucks? I don't need your sharity! I'll dance for my money!	Oh, you poor soul. You think that rat is a remote.
I am so wasted. Oh my God, oh my God, we're having a simultaneous pass out!	Homie, they're beautiful. That Chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! I feel a swoon coming on... Here it is!
Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.	Oh, fine.
Hm...	Oh, you poor man. You smell worse than you did last time.
Hey, I know you. We met in a police lineup.	Hey buddy, that's nice sign work. Your penmanship is clear yet sad.
You don't have to tell me, I was number three. Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?	Oh yeah, yeah. You know, number two and number four are an item now.
Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!	"I think you would do well with ""crazy guy."""
Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you...	Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work.
All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary!	I also found this in your drawer.
Nope.	Are these Diamondique?
Nope.	Diamondelle?
Nope.	Cubic Diamondium?
Close, but no cigar. Just plain diamonds.	Dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
I heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor.	Hostess Twinkies?
Yeah, you heard your mother.	Go ride bikes for a while, huh.
MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU...	That's what you call commitment to a bit.
Thank you. Thank you. Remember, my dog up and died. Thank you.	MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU...
I want to get a second house. Closer to work.	You got your wife the earrings, man. Why are you still doin' this?
But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice...	You're panhandling! I should have known from that panhandling sign! Plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
I don't understand.	And to remind you of what you've done, I'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions.
Hoo boy, are you in trouble.	Nothing.
When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off.	What're you talkin' about?
Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.	And George Jefferson, wherever you are, we love you and want you to come home!
"Where's the ""ee-yow?"""	Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.
You didn't sit on the toilet!	All yours, Homer.
Butt on bowl, little man!	Didn't have to, I'm a dude.
It doesn't matter!	Hey, my-my pants aren't down!
Ee-yow!	It doesn't matter!
Joke's on me, is it...?	Why you little...!
It's old lady Simpson! Run!	What's all that racket?!
Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on...	What's going on?
...I'm taking you all out for pancakes!	Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on...
Yeah!	Yay!
Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish.	They just painted the tower brown.
Hey, Apu, what's with the line?	Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish.
Pre-nursery school?!	It's application day at Miss Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School.
Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!	You know, Marge makes a good point -- competitive schools aren't for every baby.
C'mon, Maggie. You're getting into that school!	Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!
Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all!	I will hire a collection agency.
I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship.	Maggie, we're not a mime school, so we can't take a non-talker, but here's some good news: the Gap will always need sweater-folders.
Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer...	My baby has no future!
...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez.	Grocers don't make that much.
I'm taking you all out for tacos!	Maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. C'mon.
Woo-hoo! I got that one right too!	Well, congratulations. You're now as intelligent as a pig. Let's see if you can move up to dolphin -- how many people in your family?
Go, Seminoles!	Go, Maggie!
So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids.	Yes, thank you.
"""If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby."" I'm slappin' this sucker right over ""Support Our Troops."""	"""'Got Your Nose' And Other Lies""..."
Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!	Well, then... find a new identity.
That still sounds like the smart kid.	All right, if I'm second rate as the smart kid, I'll find a new raison d'être.
The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog.	Bullies rule!
That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er!	Huh. Oh. Muh. Eh. Er.
I'll be right back.	This-is-Huh-oh-muh-eh-er's-doc-tor. He's-too-sick-to-work-today.
Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why?	I hope this typeface catches people's eye. It sure didn't move our old fondue set!
Oh, I knew it!	Giant tongue.
Hit the red button!	Maggie! The red button... Hit the red button!
I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!	Maggie! Press the red button!
Damn it!	I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!
Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!	Lisa! You're all right!
Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere.	You can do it. Red!
Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food.	Uh-hmm.
How'd you get in here?	I believe I can answer that.
Zing.	I'm afraid your daughter is no longer welcome at our school. She's as common as an angry woman in an Ibsen play.
That's my baby, jerk.	She could be... at sweeping up hair.
The Wild Dingleberries?	Oh, shoosh yourself.
I am so there!	But they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
"How 'bout ""Diet Coke -- the Movie?""... ""President Air Bud: Tail To The Chief?""... ""My Big Fat Greek Salad?"""	Sorry, pally, the Dingleberries are sold out. But looking at you, I'm sure your kids are used to disappointment.
Ooh, well, I am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. And the wager only sweetens the deal.	"Sold out... Sorry... Not a movie. The only movies starting now are ""The Re-deadening"" and ""Teenage Sex Wager."""
What Would Jesus View?	Mr. Simpson, that movie is condemned by our church's movie guide.
Okay kids, forget the movie. We'll just go to the furniture store and sit down.	Never leave the day room! Never leave the day room! Never leave the day room!
"""The Re-deadening""? Is that any good?"	"Ah, two for ""The Re-deadening,"" please."
Hey Lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?	Classic Hollywood story -- the director saw my photo in a medical book.
"Don't ruin it for me! One adult and four children for ""The Re-deadening."""	Oh yeah, there are lots of kids in it! They fall victim to a vicious--
Relax, stupid. Everything you see is make believe. Although it is based on a true story. Some of which happened in this very theater.	Mr. Simpson, I'm scared.
Oh honey, don't be scared. Look, they killed the evil doll.	Dad, I don't like this movie. Can we go home?
Honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?	Well, what do you know? It's unkillable.
That's my girl.	Honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?
But scaring kids is good for them. It hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.	Homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you.
Who loves ya, baby?	Homie, that Kojak is sexier than Cannon and Barnaby Jones put together. I think he looks a little like you.
Okay. You have the right to remain sexy. Anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. If you cannot afford a sex-torney--	"How about a little ""interrogation?"""
That's it. It's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin.	"I don't see any ghost. I did find this Newsweek from 1986: ""Why America Loves Saddam Hussein."""
I thought we killed him!	None other! I've been hiding in your attic -- living off the moisture I can suck from the rafters!
But I did delete him from my bulk email list.	No we didn't.
Oh yeah. That monkey got America through some tough times.	That's right. Twice a week I get your email of the monkey peeing in his own mouth.
No way! He's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.	Forgive me. I'm just so envious of the happiness you all have. Can I please be part of it, just 'til I get back on my feet?
C'mon, little fella. You're hangin' with me tonight.	Oh my. Well, Homer, maybe you should take him to Moe's.
Guys, I'd like you to meet Artie Ziff.	C'mon, little fella. You're hangin' with me tonight.
I'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.	I fold. / Me too. / I'm out. / I'm done.
And the peanuts in your mouth.	Well, I'm out of cash. But would you accept ninety-eight per cent of the outstanding shares of ZiffCorp stock?
All of them.	Achem!
Four jacks.	Flush. What have you got?
Check it out! I own a multi-national corporation. I always knew some day I'd be a C.O.D.	Four jacks.
Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.	It's scum like you that undermine investor confidence.
I sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.	You're the majority shareholder?
Don't tell my kids I'm going to jail! Tell them I've joined the Blue Man Group! I'm the fat one!	All right, I admit it. I did run ZiffCorp into the ground. Then this man took me into his home when no one else would. And now, as a result of his brilliant card playing he's the one you want! Tape his mouth so he can't deny it!
Plead the fifth amend-what?	Homer Simpson, how do you respond to the charge that your company has betrayed the public trust?
Refuse to answer on the grounds that I what?	Plead the fifth amend-what?
Inseminate myself? Dudes, I think this guy's comin' on to me.	Refuse to answer on the grounds that I what?
Your majesty, can I go home now?	Oh, for heaven's sakes!
"I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!"	Okay, fine, he is.
Can I apply my time toward a future crime?	Sorry you were wrongfully imprisoned, Simpson.
Oh my God! Maggie, you're talking!	Oh Dad, I missed you so much.
Oh Bart, what a man you've become.	Homer, I believe that's Lisa.
I don't think we've seen the last of Artie Ziff.	I have to admit, I'll miss having him around.
Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too big.	Aw, man! I waited three weeks at the wrong ticket window.
Get your own, mooch.	Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too big.
Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet.	Trebulon Minor...?
Hey, my car insurance expired. Quite a while ago.	Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet.
That's it. From now on I'm not looking forward to anything. Oh my God, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! I can't wait!	"Worst ""Cosmic Wars"" ever. I will only see it three more times. Today."
That was you!?	Kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? That's how I got the Channel Six weather girl to start wearing a bra.
Marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!	I'll write the letter.
And I know just where to find him. 742 Evergreen Terrace.	We're gonna have to track Randall Curtis down and make him listen to us.
He's in the house?	Dad, that's our address.
And it's a perfect time... I just got fired again.	Well, northern California is wine country -- we could take a tour.
Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?	Enjoy your tour, and take it easy on Mr. Curtis. Your father and I will be across the street at The Lush Valley Winery.
Well yeah, legally. But if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?	We should do more together. You're my best friend, Homie.
Hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. But you'll have to catch me first!	The doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter.
Ow, my ankles snapped.	Hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. But you'll have to catch me first!
Ahh, summer in Tuscany.	The Mediterranean climate is reproduced by cool Pacific winds, mixed with exhaust fumes from the highway.
Pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either.	Mmm, it goes great with the Jolly Rancher I'm sucking on!
I drank this much!	"""Fox Broadcasting, 10201 West Pico, Building 203..."""
Ooh! Can I have my special cup?	Homie, to store the extra wine we bought, I made a little wine cellar.
Oh honey, I love to hear you laugh.	Homie, you are so cute.
Yes you do.	I don't talk like that.
Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says.	Moe's Tavern? That's your fun place, like me and the lamp store.
Two glasses of wine, Moe.	Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says.
All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel.	Now, in a step I perhaps should have taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector's guide.
Yep. Your mother and I have become a legendary party couple. Like Scott and Zelda Munster!	Did you guys get home at two last night?
Sorry, Marge -- I gotta break in my ski boots some time.	Do you have to make such an unholy racket?
No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.	Maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
You got it. And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible.	Okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
Uh-oh. Here comes the gospel according to puke.	You got it. And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible.
Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing.	I hope I can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
Ahh, the Germans. You just can't stay mad at 'em.	Eins, zwei, drei, beer!
You can just nurse it.	Isn't that a little big?
Nurse it! Nurse it!	You can just nurse it.
Yes, and you've said that several times now.	Have you ever walked on stilts? It's not that great.
I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.	Eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out.
Okay, okay. Remember the rules for drinking and driving. Drive slow but not too slow. Drink some cola to keep yourself alert.	I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.
What the?	Okay, okay. Remember the rules for drinking and driving. Drive slow but not too slow. Drink some cola to keep yourself alert.
Nice work, cruise control.	What the?
In a minute, honey.	Are we home yet?
Oh my God! If I get one more D.U.I., they'll take away my license. And what will I leave when I rent rollerblades?	In a minute, honey.
I paid your bail, honey. You're free to go.	Aw, this is a new low for me.
But you do believe it, right?	I can't believe I drove drunk.
That's my girl!	I don't know what to believe anymore.
She's not coming anymore.	Where's your wife tonight, Homer?
Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love.	What? It's 'cause of her I put in a bidet. Well, it's actually just a step ladder by the water fountain.
Well, what I did was...	Hey, look. I've been in the bartender business for a long time alright, I've heard it all.
Can I have some peanuts?	What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up.
I can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? Sir, she is not an alcoholic! You can't put me on hold! I'll put you on hold!	My drinking problem is out of control. At Oktoberfest, all I could think about was beer! I couldn't even celebrate... the harvest.
I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold. AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!	I can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? Sir, she is not an alcoholic! You can't put me on hold! I'll put you on hold!
Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. MacARTHUR PARK IS MELTING IN THE DARK / ALL THAT SWEET GREEN ICING ROLLING DOWN / SOMEONE LEFT MY CAKE OUT IN THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI- LI... LI... LI... LI...	Cash bribes only.
Flanders, can you watch my kids while I'm at the rehab clinic?	Your loss, stupid lady.
My demons and I are closer than ever. Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. I'm just goin' in to bust Marge out.	Oh, thank God. You're finally fighting your demons.
Feed my pets and tape my shows!	Well, that's good too, I guess.
I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.	Feed my pets and tape my shows!
Dammit!	Where's the package?
Marge!	Homer?
I have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. I put you behind the wheel and I'm so, so, so sorry.	Marge!
Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you.	You let me believe that I'd done such a terrible thing?
That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?	I can't believe you did that to me.
"No wonder they call it ""the good book."""	Of course.
Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown.	Yes, I really don't think you two should leave. He's a chronic alcoholic and you're in complete denial.
Okay, Marge. For you I'll give up rum-based cocktails. Except mojitos and rum and coke.	Homie, I want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking.
All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors.	It's important for me to see you take at least one step. Then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk.	Really? Even Zima?
Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible.	You really mean it?
Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?	Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible.
Where are your clothes for the gentleman who's big and fat?	Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?
Woo hoo!	The basement, sir.
So many shoppers. Ow! Damn this... ow! Resilient economy.	Homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. Homer!
Dressing room? Uh oh.	Sir...other customers need to use that dressing room.
Is it Lenny?	We've already got an informer working deep cover on your dad. One he'll never suspect.
It's not all your fault. All these years, I watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet I did nothing. So in a way, I too am a victim... of you.	My baby boy is in jail! I'm the worst mom in the world.
Oh, I get it. Blame the strangler.	You're a great mom. You were always there for Bart with love and support. His acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.	Time's up!
Interesting. Marge, what does that sign say?	My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.
I believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.	So, why do you want to be a guard here?
Uh-huh. When does training start?	This end's for beating, this end's for holding.
Put that sissy down!	Keep away! Keep away!
If you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?	Put that sissy down!
That's right. I got a job here so I can watch over you like a mother hen.	Dad?!
I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge.	His dad's a screw?
Well, that's the end of my shift.	Not so tough now, huh?
See you Monday. Oh wait, Monday's Martin Luther King Day. I'll see ya when I see ya.	Well, that's the end of my shift.
Love you.	See you Monday. Oh wait, Monday's Martin Luther King Day. I'll see ya when I see ya.
You just don't understand boys. He's stupid.	Why would Bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
Relax, what's the worst that could happen?	But he won't know where to go or what to eat.
No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.	I can't wait to lay my eggs in his brain.
Let's go.	No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
Son, I want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive.	Oh Bart, my troubled little lamb. You'll be in jail for so long. But I'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty.
Gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of Christmas.	"We're having ""make your own taco"" night."
I'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. We're all out of triple A's, so I'm gonna whittle down a couple of these D's.	Homie, what are you doing?
She sure loves that couch.	I'm gonna sleep on the couch.
Come on, it's your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun.	Homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. Would you please return my pants and/or underpants so I can go home?
Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong.	Grinch.
What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?	You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield.
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.	Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I'm starting to get cold feet. Please don't tell anyone.
Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!	Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here.	Homer, you're still talking to me!
Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up.	Principal Skinner is having second thoughts? Poor Edna!
Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage.	Every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart.	Spice up! Spice up!
Right, naked Duffman?	Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart.
Don't worry, I've got a man on the perimeter.	I think Skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.	Cowabunga One to Fat Load.
Okay, Fat Load here.	Denied.
Hey champ. Ready to take the plunge?	That cloud looks awesome. That rock looks awesome. My hands look awesome.
Yeah, he's crazy all right.	This is so sad.
Unkink the hose!	Well...
Wait a minute. I thought you didn't wanna get married.	Drink or I'll die.
Don't worry, Principal Skinner.	That was before I missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!
Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say.	Edna, the Klingons have a romantic saying: .
Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to.	Really? You'll be my Cyrano?
"Okay, just repeat after me. ""Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back."""	Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to.
Marge? Are you helping her?	Oh, that's so lovely. But it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!
Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?	I won't let Edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die.
Shut up! I didn't tell you to say that!	Homer, Marge, if I could just speak to Edna for a moment.
Because I'm successfully married.	Just why am I taking your advice?
Uh-oh.	There's no ring on that finger.
Why did I take it off? Oh, right. To see if I could skip it across Lake Michigan.	Uh-oh.
String quartet, are you tuned up?	Now, could you give me a pushing start?
And the castrati?	As tuned as we're gonna get in this humidity.
And a one and a two and a...	The what now?
Give her back to Skinner! A fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!	Oh, but it can. I adore Edna: she is near-mint and comes from a very limited edition -- females who will talk to me.
Okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my Lois Lane comics, buy some Jimmy Olsens, and stop Edna from making a terrible mistake!	"Edna's with Comic Book Guy? Oh God, she's on the rebound! And you meet the worst guys on the rebound. It's how Jackie got her ""O""!"
Don't worry, Marge. We'll get something to eat.	I wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
I don't see Skinner anywhere.	Don't worry, Marge. We'll get something to eat.
That room has a dry erase board. They could be doing anything in there! Anything.	They're going into Multi-Purpose Room B!
Okay Marge, I hear ya. Now that Krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems.	At least I was planned.
Marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and I became one.	Our marriage is just an illusion. He doesn't care how I feel at all. He doesn't know how to love.
Would you marry me again?	Marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and I became one.
And now, Padre, if you would do the honors.	A band in a closet! Every girl's dream.
Marge, you just agreed to raise the kids Klingon!	I do!
Okay, don't go. Just stay here and rot with Grampa.	Please don't make us go. If you make me get on that plane, I'll give myself diarrhea! I know how!
I'll right-side you!	I'm only rotting on the right side.
I say you don't exist!	"I'm sorry sir, the computer says the movie ""Chocolate Star Wars"" doesn't exist."
Can I have both?	A chick flick? Say it ain't so, Ho!
"Son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs."""	Can I have both?
Exactly.	Like what? They'll do something with you that they hate?
WHERE DO I BEGIN? TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GREAT A LOVE CAN BE...	Exactly.
THE SIMPLE SOMETHING THAT DUM DEEDLE DUM DEE DEE... / NOW LET'S PUSH PLAAAY!	THE SWEET LOVE STORY THAT IS OLDER THAN THE SEA...
Yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the Hell up!	Opinion noted. Now if you don't mind, your father and I are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy.
Eh, well, I wouldn't be happy.	Homie, if I died, would you be sad?
So, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?	Stupid kids ruin everything.
We're alone now.	Homie, you know I'm usually good for a triple-X throw down, but between those kids and going to Uncle Tyrone's, we can't be alone.
Why you little...	You're never alone in this crapshack!
Here's your future!	Honeymooners -- no kids, no worries.
Remember our honeymoon?	Not me, I do crunches.
Marge, let's do it.	You know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to Miami!
We get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? As the Bible says: screw that!	What about Uncle Tyrone?
We don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane.	We get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? As the Bible says: screw that!
There's a first class?	So we're upgrading you to First Class.
"And look at me, I'm reading ""The Economist."" Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?"	This is so luxurious! I feel like I'm Princess Grace and Princess Di smashed together!
It is.	No!
Boy, it's great being here without those children of yours.	All right ladies -- get ready to settle!
And tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump.	Yeah, I've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone.
You keep thinking that!	Seriously, with the new breast pumps, and Diaper Genies, and corporate flex-time, child-rearing oughta be a snap!
COME ON EVERYBODY HAVE SOME SEX-UAL CONGRESS / NOT THE KIND OF CONGRESS THAT CONTAINED PAUL TSONGAS...	Ewww.
Marge, I won't let that happen. We have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. Not 'til Lisa's in college and we've lost contact with Bart.	The kids tracked us down! Our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
I've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!	You're right, but where do we go?
Noooo!	So, Mom and Dad are going to Atlantic City...but their luggage isn't. And Homer's getting the low-fat meal.
Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag.	Homie, people in the other elevators can see us.
Occupied!	Hey kids, I'm tying balloons on the boardwalk at three, five, seven, nine and eleven. Check it out. Come on, don't be ridiculous.
At last, we're alone...	Your neck skin dances when you speak.
Oh, right.	Homie, the waiter's still here.
And now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. But before the intercourse, the dinner course.	Thank you, sir.
I knew if we got up early enough, we could sneak away from Bart and Lisa. Kids don't beat me, I beat kids.	I'm grown up, I'm grown up!
Never!	Let me finish my sentence!
This way!	Never!
Quick -- we can hide in here!	This way!
Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!	I don't know... Homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?
This must be what it's like to be in space.	Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!
And yet, I've never been to me.	You've been to space.
That sliding should stop soon.	And yet, I've never been to me.
This rolling is just temporary.	That sliding should stop soon.
Ah, that's better. So why do they call this place Niagara Falls anyway?	This rolling is just temporary.
No one does that to my daughter!	Tonight... we reveal a shocking secret.
Quiet, the commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV.	What did those women expect? When you sign a contract with Fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated.
Do I ever!	Do you love that sooo-weet smell of Farmer Billy's bacon?
Would I!	Would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?
I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!	If you like bacon, you're gonna love it. And if you don't like bacon, well then the hell with you.
Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.	Okay, Farmer Billy's slow-killed bacon, Farmer Billy's bacon-fed bacon, Farmer Billy's travel bacon... Mr. Simpson, if you really want to kill yourself, I also sell handguns.
Nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! At long last.	Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.
Huh?	Please, Mr. Simpson, please. I fear your smooches are premature. This is, in fact, a silver ticket.
Judge a pig competition?... But I'm no super-genius! Or are I?	"""This silver ticket entitles you to judge the pig competition, at the Springfield County Fair."""
Hey, I know that country!	This song is about a country I love -- you may have heard of it. It's called America.
USA! USA!	BUT I LOVE THIS COUNTRY / TO ME SHE HAS NO SINS / IF YOU DON'T BUY MY RECORD / THEN AL QAEDA WINS!
Comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...	Of all the days for you to get a zit.
Ugh, too eighties.	Comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...
But I've gotta do something! I'll need a disguise.	One more felony assault, Simpson, and you're goin' down. I didn't know I could fit in a bubble. I must be losin' weight.
Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!	Shall we ever see Springfield's costumed protector again?
Whatcha doin', sweetie?	Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!
That's really sweet, honey.	I'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the Pie Man.
Aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down.	That's really sweet, honey.
What's wrong, son?	Dad, I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Somebody ought to take him down a peg. Or, should I say, down a pie.	He was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.
Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie.	"No, I think the expression is ""peg."""
Comic Book Guy! Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!	Oh brother. Why do we get all the weirdos here at the comic book store?
Oh, I think you'd find his filling extremely hot.	You can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
Flanders!? He's not man enough to trim my crust. I mean Pie Man's crust. I'm not Pie Man.	Ooh, I'll bet he's Ned Flanders.
This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!	Pie -- popular pastry, tricky math thing, and now, sword of righteousness. A masked avenger has been giving Springfield's scoundrels their just desserts.
No trap can hold Homer Simpson! But I'm not Homer Simpson. I'm the Pie Man. Homer Simpson away! I mean, the Pie Man!	Pie Man, no! It's a trap!
Dammit!	Shoot to kill!
Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet.	That was so exciting, yet familiar. Like Coke with lemon.
Pie Man is not your father, little girl. I... murdered your father.	Dad?
We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.	Dad, please. It's obvious you're Pie Man. We've been getting his mail for weeks.
Watch it, one more step. Welcome to my secret lair.	We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
So it would seem. Anyhoo, I'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? Mild-mannered Homer Simpson...	Dad, this is the basement. Here's the iced tea I left down here this afternoon.
Honorable men can differ. Now what brings you down here?	You're not mild-mannered. You're often liquored-up and rude.
All right, I'll stop. But what'll I do with these pies?	I want you to stop this, Dad. Before you get killed.
I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food.	Well, I know one thing you could do...
I'll show him.	Simpson, you're late, bald and stupid! I'm docking you a day's pay.
No, I shouldn't.	I'll show him.
Or should I?	No, I shouldn't.
I'll keep my promise, honey.	Or should I?
Since when do I listen to cakes?	Don't do it, Homer! You made a promise to Lisa!
You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each and every one of you.	Tell you what, Homer -- you make one last hit, then you're out of the business forever. Lisa would understand.
I've run out of pie-related puns!	Again?
It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!	Simpson! You'll rue the day you took that pie tin, poked holes for eyes, and attached a rubber band around the back!
I already work for you.	Wait, I have a better idea. You'll work for me now.
Do I get two paychecks?	In addition to working in your normal capacity at the plant, you will also serve as my personal hit man.
But I promised my daughter--	Here's your first assignment. To prove your loyalty.
Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!	Do as I say or I'll tell the police. You'll do so much community service.
No, not him! Anyone but him! I've had my problems with him. Everyone has. But like every monster, he just wants to be loved.	Now open the folder. It contains your next victim.
I can't sleep. I keep thinking about the Pie Man.	Come on! It's cobblering time!
What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?	Oh, me too...
No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it.	Homie... are you the Pie Man?
See...	No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it.
You know I'm not Pie Man.	Now, on a different subject, kiss me hard.
Oh come on, she's a little girl.	Girl Scout cookies!
Sorry.	Now pie that Brownie, fruitcake!
The Dalai Lama!	Ga-ga. Goo-goo. Your assignment.
I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she have to believe in things?	As Springfield's youngest Buddhist, I am deeply honored to introduce the Dalai Lama.
No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape from this nightmare.	C'mon, Pie Man, hit him! That's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!
I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!	Yeah, and Homer's a dumbass! No offense, Homer. Ya dumbass.
Yeah. Let's go home, honey.	Dad, I think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to.
Was it the kiss?	I know one person who believes you were the Pie Man, Homie... me. I've known it all along.
Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!	So... Pie Man, why don't you show me your superpowers? Pie Man?
Homer drunk... but how? Hmmm...	I wouldn't mind pushin' that in the mud.
My beer! You never had a chance to become my urine! Why you little...	Eww! I kissed that sad, weird kid!
Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?	Now up, the case of Simpson v. Simpson.
Permission to treat this witness as hostile.	Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?
Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you.	Your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.	Twelve kids died at our camp. We need the money to pay lawyers.
I couldn't believe my eye.	The sailing instruct-arrr! And on movie night I run the project-arrr! Only P.G., nothin' R. Yarrr.
She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage.	I couldn't believe my eye.
Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess.	Yes... and then your father broke my heart. And if I'd known he was you, I never would have married you!
Whee! Recess!	Granted.
Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you.	Let me get this straight. When you were my age, you had the hots for Mom and didn't even know it? That's cool. Or is it lame? I guess I'll go with lame. You're lame.
I'm so lame!	I've kissed three girls.
Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right?	You're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
Think, Homer, think.	Oh, I'm sure it's a much nicer name than Homer.
I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.	What did you say?
There goes a good friend.	No, no, I'd best be on me way. I'll just take some Teddy Grahams for the road.
It was pretty delicious.	The perfect kiss!
Whuh-oh.	But then your father showed his true colors.
She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up...	"Ha ha! You said ""dog doo""!"
We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before:	She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up...
Kids love trains.	Sweet, sweet poison. Uh-oh.
Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?	I can't believe I went five minutes without one of these dream sticks.
She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.	If you are who I think you are, that girl is gone and she never wants to see you again.
No.	Was that special?
I just blew my first chance at true love.	No.
And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me.	I just blew my first chance at true love.
Earth to special girl? You forgive me, right?	And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me.
What about now?	Homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant.
What about now?	No, Homer.
What about now?	No, Homer.
Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?	No, Homer.
That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you.	Homie, I know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. I guess it didn't mean that much to you.
All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.	I wish there was some way I could believe that.
Ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. Someday I'll write you back, Osama. Ah, here's what I'm lookin' for.	All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.
I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king.	Oh, Homie! You did care.
Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?	I kept my heart too.
Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge.	Oh, Elvis.
Here you go.	Make mine calico!
Don't forget Maggie!	Well, that just leaves Bart.
Doctor! Perform a diagnosis!	Whoa, something's wrong! Ah, ah, I can't hear!
Cool!	The boy's hearing should clear up in a day. If it doesn't, call me in the Bahamas. For now, he can express himself with this complimentary pen.
Bart, pass the ketchup. Bart, pass the ketchup!	What'd you say about me mother?! For your information, her feet stank 'cause she works in manure all day! But it's still the best darn Starbucks in Glasgow!
Oh, sorry, right.	Dad, he's deaf.
Bart, pass the corn. Bart, pass the corn!	Oh, sorry, right.
Everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.	Donkey Basketball? Now I've heard everything! Unlike you!
To date!	Your child's behavior appalls me, not just as a principal, but as a veteran of America's only losing war.
Uh-oh.	No one calls me unpatriotic.
Hey, guys.	Uh-oh.
Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I'll just talk to myself. Hey, how ya doin', Homer? Oh, not too bad, how about you? Oh I'm fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. You keep your hands off my wife! Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes...	Hey, guys.
Oh, Homer, stop it!	Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I'll just talk to myself. Hey, how ya doin', Homer? Oh, not too bad, how about you? Oh I'm fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. You keep your hands off my wife! Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes...
Even my best friends have left me! I'm all alone!	Goodbye, Homer. I can't get drunk and vomit next to a guy I don't respect.
Y'ello. Appear on your TV show?! Tell our side of the story?! You'll see us there?! Goodbye?! Dial tone?!	We've become pariahs! In the last two hours I've gotten one thousand hate spams.
No, no, no, let her finish.	We get it, Mom.
Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat.	Look, what should I say to make people not hate me?
Just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. But don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy.	Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat.
Talk about boats! Then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't.	Dad, I am going on a talk show. I have to say something!
There there, save your lies for the American public.	But I don't hate this country.
What'd you say?	If by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, I do hate Americans!
BUY ME SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKERJACK... / I DON'T CARE IF... OW!	Martha! Play something to lighten the mood!
Do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?	Well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride.
Bill Clinton? What are you doin' here?	Well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. Check out all the left-wing celebrities.
Yeah, yeah. Next commercial.	Homer, we've got to get outta here.
Who are you?	I know a way out.
I don't want to be in any stupid talent show. Not without my Tennessee walking horses.	I'm the last registered democrat. Tax and spend! Tax and spend! Now, if you want to escape, you can do it during the prison talent show tomorrow night.
Now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. But you can't spell U.S.A. without us... eh?	You guys are on after Al Franken, so the guards will have used up most of their bullets. Make your break at the end of your act.
FIFTY STARS AND THIRTEEN STRIPES...	O BEAUTIFUL / FOR SPACIOUS SKIES / FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN...
TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY IS NO CHORE...	"MY CARD HERE SAYS ""ACLU"" / NOW LOOK WHAT I'M GOING TO DO..."
We mean it, don't move.	WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR OUR ENCORE...
OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES...	They've escaped!
Because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. And this time I want it tight!	Dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?
What genius put a prison on the middle of an island?	Because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. And this time I want it tight!
Yes.	Does everyone remember their swimming lessons?
Great, dive in.	No.
I'm not made of money! We'll swim to Oakland.	Swim toward San Francisco!
Oh, what's the use? Even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate America. I don't want to end up like Elmo, hanging himself in prison.	There's a ship! We're saved!
And here no one calls me a fat jerk... I'm a gourmand!	The food is so delicious here. And these Chanel suits are five for a dollar! I'm using a jacket as a napkin.
No, Marge, there's one group that's always welcome in America: immigrants without I.D.	I wish we could go back, but I don't think we're welcome there.
Well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in America.	No, Marge, there's one group that's always welcome in America: immigrants without I.D.
Simpson.	Name?
Ooh, that'll save some time.	From now on, you're the Simps!
Now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. I'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop.	Ooh, that'll save some time.
Bart! You promised you'd stop making that comparison.	Today, Geezer Rock will be officially designated a national landmark!
Per... our... agreement!	Bart! You promised you'd stop making that comparison.
If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?	He's got a tree in his eye!
There's a lot you don't know about me, Marge. A lot that would shock you.	You don't sell roadside corn.
"Here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!"	But I didn't read my poem!
Bart, you're grounded for a year.	Well, at least some good came out of today.
Okay, three bucks.	I'll just pay the fine.
Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!	Publish it myself? Why not? I could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. I'd be a publisher, just like Katherine Graham!
I'm always happy to help you, sweetie.	Thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of The Red Dress Press, Dad.
He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.	I'm always happy to help you, sweetie.
Extree! Extree! Man driving erratically throws papers out window!	He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.
Boy, I can't wait to dance on his grave.	Burns is alive? Then whose skull am I drinkin' beer out of?
These batteries have to power everything in our house!	Dad! Mr. Burns cut our power -- now I can't print my paper!
YO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT... WHAT I WANT WHAT I WANT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I...	These batteries have to power everything in our house!
That was totally worth it.	YO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT... WHAT I WANT WHAT I WANT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I...
Oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind.	So, has your daughter always been such a righteous little rabble-rouser?
Wait a minute. Are you trying to get dirt on Lisa?	Fascinating. Do go on.
Well, if that's your custom.	You saw right through me. Well done! Have some congratulatory drugs.
Okay.	Now, tell me more about your daughter. And speak into the lamp.
Well, she's into Buddhism, whistle-blowing, totally against pollution no matter what I say...	Okay.
Well, that loser Milhouse has always had a thing for her. Don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?	Liberal whacko, eh? Any young beaux?
"I'm so sorry, honey. I said good things about you too. Check out the Lifestyle section: ""Plastic pearls make the girl."""	Dad, how could you say these things?
Oh, I can't stand seeing one of my children like this.	Take my wallet and leave me alone!
Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers.	Look at you go. Type-ity type, type, type!
"""All my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. I may be her father, but when I grow up, I wanna be just like her. Except still a dude."""	"""The Homer Times""?"
See, Lisa? Instead of one Big Shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions.	Check out the Willie World News: I review the new tractors. They're all shite!
You're the only one who won't shut up about it.	Am I the only one here who's in horrible pain?
Trying to get a Frisbee off the roof.	Homer, what are you doing?
And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee off the ledge?	My, you look awfully pale. Let's get you some fresh air.
Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?	Well I didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
People's deaths, eh?	Homer, I can foretell people's deaths!
Do me! Do me!	People's deaths, eh?
What kind of bread?	Uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich.
Woo hoo!	Country parmesan.
Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?	Don't worry, sweetie. I am not going to kill your father.
Hey Chief, throw me your piece.	Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three.
C'mon, shoot me a new one!	Uh, sure thing, citizen.
Oh, I'm so scared. Ned Flanders is pointing a gun at me. You couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if I whacked the barrel like this.	C'mon, shoot me a new one!
Never!	Quit whackin' my barrel!
Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake.	Homer, stay away from the nuclear plant.
But ice cream cake...	But you're gonna kill us all...
It sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.	Do it! Do it! Kill everyone!
Everything's comin' up Homer.	Homer, I am so mad at you! I'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!
Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?	Yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. The garage made it to Heaven too!
Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?	Your Frisbee.
You're not the boss of me.	Oh yeah. Just stay away from the three bean salad.
Please spare me. I'm not a murderer, I'm not. And I've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!	Hmmm.
Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy.	Prior to ingestion, the pill must be reduced by my amazing new shrink ray.
Oh, Mag... No wait, this is yours.	I've got her!
Captain!	Bio-nauts assemble!
Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut.	Now, you must enter the subclavian vein!
Bah! Has science ever kissed a woman, or won the Super Bowl, or put a man on the moon? This is what I think of your precious science.	Dad, you should listen to him. He's a man of science and you can barely read!
Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage.	Why is my swimsuit so revealing?
Maybe this'll help.	Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage.
There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.	Where'd you get that rib?
And to make sure we get there super fast, I'm hitting all the buttons with my palm.	Learning is cool!
We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?...	Although I must admit, they know where to stop.
Fine, me.	We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?...
I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!	Don't worry. We'll be fine!
Boy, when God closes a door, he opens a window.	I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!
I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.	Oh, I feel full enough as it is.
I need a mouth hole. And some other holes too.	I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
I'VE GOT YOU DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME...	Cheer up, my chubby inner child. I've got a feeling everything's going to work out fine. Because I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN...
Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself.	Simpson.
Turn that down!	Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself.
Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household.	Relax, we're just looky-loos. We're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors.
A slightly colder fridge? In my lifetime? Amazing.	It's so beautiful and modern. Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge...
And check this out.	This is the kitchen I've always wanted. Ooh, a bread maker-maker!
A walk-in microwave! Hey Marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?	And check this out.
Uh-oh.	A walk-in microwave! Hey Marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?
And I kept that vow.	Homie, when I married you, I knew we wouldn't live in luxury.
I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie.	But seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!	Oh, Homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor.
Man, that hurt. And now to do the exact same thing again.	A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!
All right.	Maybe you should turn off the power.
Fine.	Don't demolish along the way!
Easy... easy...	Fine.
Trying to.	"""Playdude"" magazines? Have you been hiding bosom rags from me?"
But I need them for the articles!	These magazines are from before we were married. Maybe you should throw them away.
Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me.	I like-a to kiss.
Steady, steady...	I'm not wearing any clothes. So why don't I just splay myself on a pool table!
"Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about ""Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen."""	Okay, here's your precious articles.
What man would want you now?	"Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about ""Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen."""
There it is, nice and smooth. I'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job.	We are Playdude Playmates! We are Playdude Playmates!
Oh, now you tell me.	I think you used too much plaster.
So that's what that white noise was.	I never stopped telling you.
Get lost, crook!	Thanks for taking the job. I'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
Why don't you just kiss her?	That's all right, Mrs. Simpson. Many husbands feel emasculated when their wife must turn to a professional to satisfy her remodeling needs.
How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.	What's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?
I was thinking of chicken wings.	How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
Those are good too.	I was thinking of chicken wings.
Your mother's about to show us her new recipe.	Bart, can you come in here for a second?
Marge, I don't want to freak you out, but I think I love you.	It's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!
I'm proud of you, honey.	Oh my God! Someone, somewhere says I'm better than someone else!
Adult themes? What are you talking about?	Listen here, Simpson. Your son has been exposing our kids to adult themes, unabashed dictionaries, and the lesser short fiction of John Cheever!
Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.	Ralphie wants to go on the pill!
Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?	I can't believe my Mom would cheat.
But she'll still win the contest?	Oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul.
But win the contest?	And lose her soul.
Woo-hoo! If Marge becomes Auntie Ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities...	Yes.
Look! It's Mister Cashew... the Koobler Dwarfs... Snip, Crinkle and Poof...	Woo-hoo! If Marge becomes Auntie Ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities...
Twinkle the Kidd, I love you!	Look! It's Mister Cashew... the Koobler Dwarfs... Snip, Crinkle and Poof...
Blood for creme! Blood for creme!	Blood for creme! Blood for creme!
Would you excuse us, Milton?	Bachelors are always squeezin' stuff!
"Yeah, and your father's ""No House."" Now scram."	It's Milhouse.
Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But what's going on up here?	"Yeah, and your father's ""No House."" Now scram."
"Uh-um... What do you think ""some"" is?"	I'm just spreadin' the Playdude philosophy. Hi-fi's, Norman Mailer, gettin' some...
I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life.	Uh... toys?
Do you know what a boob is?	I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life.
Good. That'll save us some time. Okay... why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed?	Oh yeah.
Exactly. And we're poor because we have kids. And the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...	Because we're poor?
Well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough.	And then the woman...
And Marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house.	Thanks, honey, for saving me from myself.
Hey, it keeps the kids quiet.	B.F.D. I've had your scrambled eggs, Homer. The secret ingredient is whiskey.
That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate.	Dad, the kids at school said my butt's big.
"Every Simpson starts with a circle. Daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. Hm, I'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""M"" and a ""G."""	That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate.
See?	You wanna know a little trick? To downsize my derrière, I just tie a sweater around it.
Oh, I love to see my man eat.	Oh, Homer, you're wasting away to nothing. You simply must eat something. Well, you're the boss!
Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test.	There's my hundred -- where's my party?
All right.	Nope, it's real -- check out the watermark.
Really? Frankfurter... is that anything?	Homer, the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort.
All right, boy, which con did you work here? Copy off another kid? Pay attention and take notes? Well, take note of this!	See, it's all legit. Now make with the party.
I thought you two broke up.	People, please. It's a school night.
Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap.	Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ...
So they're growing up. Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then, the peace of the grave.	It's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. They'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
Open.	Next on ABC, who's dropping by to see George Lopez? We pray it's you!
Well, that explains a lot. Who's hungry?	I never meant to leave you, Nelson. But uh, something awful happened when I went to the store.
They're a family again. And so are we. What happened?	I wish it were that simple. I really do.
And Lisa, what have you learned?	Sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?	Nothing. Like many women, I still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight.
C'mon, say something conclusive.	I guess. But there's a long way to go.
Open-ended! C'mon, Lisa. Say everything's fine. Everything's fine.	I'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
Prove it.	That was you.
Woo hoo! Free cheese!	Perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
What's happened to us, Marge? We used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. Then came the heart attacks.	Homer, that was for the dog.
Woo hoo! The circus!	It's a media circus!
Woo hoo! I don't know the difference!	A media circus.
What about that two-headed goat?	I didn't think anyone successful came from Springfield.
Yes, but he came here to die.	Technically he was born in Shelbyville.
One of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. How you solved crimes I'll never know.	Yes, but he came here to die.
Marge! I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit! Bart, go ahead.	You're successful too, Mom. You made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise.
Huh? Huh?	Mayah Quimby is my er ah, fathah. Give me one million dollahs!
I sawed you on the television.	Homer Simpson.
I believe it was the school's tuba.	I remember you from high school. You barfed in my tuba.
Chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything I've ever had at this table.	I believe it was the school's tuba.
Oh Marge, I'm just being polite.	Homer.
More!	I got the recipe for these in Istanbul.
Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet.	You know, Chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place.
I'm here! I'm here! Quit buggin' me!	Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet.
It's a conversation starter!	Homer, why do you always have to show that to company?
I swallowed a chicken bone.	Homer, what are you doing?
Same one.	Did you just swallow another bone?
Good news, Marge!	Oh, Mom, don't feel bad. Everybody appreciates your... uh-oh, I'm late for my dinner... with Chloe!
I've learned to walk naked on stilts!	Good news, Marge!
Oh Honey, her life can't compare to yours. You've got three kids, a TV tray from Expo sixty-seven, and you're married to King Stink!	Chloe has such an amazing life. I wonder what would have happened if I'd stuck with journalism.
Marge, listen to me. Chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. You're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together.	Yeah, I guess.
I just hate to see you upset, honey. You know what would be a good name for Maggie? Chloe.	That's a sweet thought, Homie.
Oh. Well then, carry on.	No one's fighting over you!
All right. But while I'm gone, boy, you think about what you did.	Homer, we've gotta get Lisa!
You uh...	What did I do?
Why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... I'll fix your wagon!	You uh...
And I'm growing ashamed of my penis.	I don't see Lisa in any of the seminars!
Marge, that's crazy talk. Now look, I'll save Lisa. Your place is here with the women.	She's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? That's it! She is off the Christmas card list.
Okay, you go save Lisa. I'll stay here with the women.	Booo!
What do women want?!	Booo!
Okay. I'll run as fast as I can, but I'm full of potato salad.	We've gotta go now!
Chief, my daughter's up there. You're a father too.	Anybody I know.
Pretend to care!	Mom, I wanna be just like you. I mean the lava part, not saving Lisa.
Whew!	...HIND THE 'FRIDGERATOR...
I wouldn't say that.	No harm done.
Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle.	I'm not gonna grow up!
Yeah, that's how it starts.	I thought it was chocolate milk!
"Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like ""Keep On Truckin'"". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'."	"Well, I like T-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
I've been reading this magazine for years, but I never dreamed my son would be on the cover.	Darn. It's out of ink. But my phone number's on the pen. Oh, but it's my old phone number. I'll call you.
You broke in!	Ooh!
Yeah. Nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.	We're big fans, Mr. Gladwell.
You know what, Mr. Burns? I'm never comin' back. My son's making so much cash in the T-shirt game, that I don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as I age.	And on your way out, remove all the fillings you got under our dental plan.
Bart, can I ask you an important question?	The Change Magician will change your life... for the better! Results may vary. Machine does not actually sort change. Order today!
Twenty-nine ninety-nine.	How much?
Woo hoo!	Here's fifty.
It's awesome. You know what I've gotten into? Sleeping 'til noon.	Hey, Homer, how's retirement?
Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?	Some of us have to get up for work tomorrow.
Oh, I see what's goin' on. You can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence.	Yeah. Well, enjoy the autumn of your years, jerk.
No problem. Bart, I need two hundred dollars.	Your bill, sir.
I broke some bathroom fixtures.	Dad, the bill's only a hundred.
I'm pathetic? Because I take money from my ten-year-old son? Well, let me tell you something: I still call the shots around here!	Pathetic.
I don't have an inside voice!	Homer, use your inside voice.
Lisa, basic cable said I should nurture you.	...or find inclusion in the tribe by caring for vulnerable young cubs.
Okay! You be the girl, and I'll be the car.	Great! Will you play Malibu Stacy with me?
Screw the market, we're going to Mexico!	Done and done. I'm going to the organic market!
It's El Flanderito! Run him down!	Wheeee!
Hey, what's that dealy?	I can't run, I'm wearing flip-flops!
Oh, you'll win for sure. You and science go together like Lenny and Carl. The science is Carl.	It shows the history of nuclear physics, from Marie Curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor.
Honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. Remember, I did used to work at a science factory.	A robot?! Last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. I don't have a chance now.
Sweetie, that's orphan talk.	Well, we're supposed to do this without parental help.
Stupid atomic pile. How hard could it be to build a reactor? Korea did it. And look at the quality of their animation.	Did he have a passport?
Hey, maybe the internet has the information I need! It certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement.	Hm... what to do, what to do?

All I need is some plutonium and I know just the place to get it.	Let's see, I can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano...
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!	Dad?...
Sweetie, your Daddy's gonna show you just how much he loves you. You know that non-functioning nuclear reactor you built?	Dad, what did you do?
I juiced it up a little.	Yes...
Oh, that's madiculous.	Dad, that could explode!
I never complain about your frilly pillows.	Homer, I want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!
What's the matter, boy?	I can't feel my
Son, when you grew up, I grew down. But now I can see you need your Dad more than ever.	Goose Gladwell ripped me off and there's nothin' I can do about it. I'm just a stupid kid.
Get back in the garage, old man.	And Homer, I can see you need me more than ever.
Stay out of my boxes!	But there's spiders in the boxes.
You give my son what he deserves, or I'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!	Stay out of my boxes!
Sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. If I turn this dial...	The things I saw there are what made me crazy.
The resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those Blu-Blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear.	Sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. If I turn this dial...
Damn him to hell.	The resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those Blu-Blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear.
Are you prepared to take that chance?	You can't be serious.
Not so fast. I also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's T-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat.	Okay, okay. Here's all the money I've got.
Yo, yo, yo! Keep it on the low flow!	Not so fast. I also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's T-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat.
I'm hangin' this over the mantel.	Yo, yo, yo! Keep it on the low flow!
Well, I'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son.	Thanks, Dad.
Oh, I doubt it. But we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out.	Are you sure that thing could really explode?
Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!	On the plus side, this rope is mighty soft. Hm, touch it, kids.
Re-straint! Re-straint! Re-straint!	Homer, these are people you work with. Show some restraint.
Lighten up, Marge. This is my chance to relax with people from work I never get to see. Like this guy.	Re-straint! Re-straint! Re-straint!
Really? How'm I doin'?	I'm your supervisor!
Nice tux, Moe.	Basically him and Dad.
Hey, it's a guy in a goofy Burns head!	Aviation museum audio-visual materials have taken patrons and docents alike on a rocket ride to comprehension. This is the story of those materials.
Act like Burns!	Hey, it's a guy in a goofy Burns head!
That's him to a T!	Act like Burns!
Wow, a wooden plane. It's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks.	Here we have a vintage film of the original Springfield Wing Walkers, including our own Agnes Skinner.
What a magical party this has been. Mr. Burns is a great man.	I flew it at an altitude of six feet for a distance of four-and-a-half feet. Then we discovered rain makes it catch fire. Then the Führer fired me.
C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future.	I've got a bad feeling about all of this.
Spill it, Super-boss!	Is your sense of outrage dulled?
"I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on ""Friends"" need another friend?"	Now that Mr. Burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases.
Dammit! I would've been perfect as Rachel's Irish cousin. So you're all doing each other, are ya? Well, who's going to put out for old Seamus?	That show's gone off the air.
I need a new job that provides full health benefits.	Dammit! I would've been perfect as Rachel's Irish cousin. So you're all doing each other, are ya? Well, who's going to put out for old Seamus?
-- as long as I only work five hours a day, no heavy lifting, no light clerical, none of that secret Santa crap, tasteful nudity...	Uh-huh.
Phobos? That's a good job for me.	You have defeated the doom-bot and sealed the portal. Phobos is safe.
I declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.	Mine flew away.
Dad?	I've got the answer!
The border, eh? Then I'd better sand off my fingerprints.	Now listen. All the drugs we want are right across the border. I have a friend who'll help us.
Marge? Bart? Lisa?	"Look. They used the same ""D"" for ""Dumbo"" and ""Drop"". Unbelievably, only three were ever purchased."
Wow, this is just like Hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. What gives?	A-lo-ha!
Oh man, I need something to settle my stomach.	My Dad, the drug mule.
Oh wait. I was supposed to take these with food.	Oh man, I need something to settle my stomach.
Why the sweet talk, Apu? Are you after some cheap drugs?	Oh look, it is Mr. Homer, my favorite customer! Please feel free to paw through my Playdudes and tell me to go back to some country I am not actually from.
Flanders? I don't know... I mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday.	Help me out, Homer. My little Roddy needs his insulin. Breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing.
Hold on. We're just innocent tourists.	I don't claim to be the perfect neighbor...
No cameras?	If you let us come, I will give you ten minutes alone with my Squishee machine, do what you will.
Listen you two, I'll tell you who the true God is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!	Well where's your super-team now?
All right, I'm comin' back there.	But the infinite beauty-- / But the Bible says--
My butt looks so huge during perp walks.	Today Mounties busted a major American drug smuggling ring. Former U.S. astronaut Homer Simpson was taken into custody.
Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you.	Thank God we did not stitch your name over the breast.
There are other ways to get into Canada...	I just wish we could make one last big score. But we could never drive past the border patrol.
That's it, a plane!	There are other ways to get into Canada...
Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!	Smuggle drugs in a plane? That'll never work!
Katharine Hepburn?!	I've got everything you need.
We really appreciate your help, Johnny. Is there any way we can repay ya?	Typical Canadian wimpiness. That's why you have snowballs and we have the H bomb.
Really? In America we do it four times a week. You come on down and I'll get us front row seats.	Well, I've always wanted to see a man with the I.Q. of a child executed by the state. We don't get that up here.
Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.	We're losing altitude. Time to dump all unnecessary weight.
One... two... Eh, I'd rather die.	Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.
Well, at least we're all in this together.	It's no use. We've got to make an emergency landing.
We'll make it, Dad. On a wing and a prayer.	And these two are gifts for my nephews. Tally ho!
Dammit.	We'll make it, Dad. On a wing and a prayer.
Great news, honey! Burns made me a freelance consultant!	Yes. Smithers, I was a stingy old fool. But from now on, I'll provide drug benefits to all my full-time employees.
Hey, what's this lump?	Great news, honey! Burns made me a freelance consultant!
See you in Hell, document!	Now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage.
Now remember to eat smart, people. Go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with THAT cheap stuff.	Way to build equity!
Screw you.	A roll, sir?
Smoked salmon... Shrimp... Crab legs!	Oatmeal?
I win...	Smoked salmon... Shrimp... Crab legs!
I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!	How rude! What do I have to do to enjoy a Sunday brunch with my secret other family?
Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare.	I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!

... Marge?	Mr. Simpson, for a loan this big, you'll have to put up your house as collateral.
Put up my house? But I just paid it off... what would Marge say?	... Marge?
Okay honey, I'll do it.	Do whatever you have to do to save Moe's. I love my Homie.
That was me.	Thanks, Homer. No one's ever trusted me before -- except for that one guy who shouldn't have.
Marge! How dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?	Homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement.
I had to! Or Moe's would stay closed forever!	M631700000642J?! This is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?
Look, look. I can see you're upset. If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.	You gave the money to Moe? How's he gonna pay us back?
Marge, you can't go with me to Moe's. I mean, how would you like it if I came with you to your mother's?	Well, maybe I'll go to Moe's too, seeing as I'm now part owner.
That's because I hate her.	I would like it. You never come to my mother's.
Just made it!	I'm just going to call the suicide hotline now. And they've blocked my number! Oh God!
Boy, I can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold...	Quittin' time!
But I don't wanna take care of the kids... Um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? Bart sleeps in the microwave, right?	I'm here protecting our investment. I'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
How many magic beans should I sell the baby for? Three? Duh, der, duh. That's me, jerk-ass Homer. Duh, der, doy.	Quit playing dumb.
Just what are you inferring?	And they seem awfully chummy.
Whew, that's a relief!	I'm not inferring anything. You infer. I imply.
Ah yes, Detroit-style. Very nice. So, you've been at Moe's every night this week.	Get lost, rummy!
Bonded?! How many times?	I know, I used to think of Moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. But now that I've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded.
Thanks, honey. My mind is completely at ease.	Homer, Moe and I are just work friends. You and I are... marriage friends.
Well, I might as well use this pucker for something.	Hey, also, I wanna....
Oh Marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?	You can't handle the twos!
Hey Moe... haven't seen you in a while.	Howdy, partner! Why don't you sit next to us?
How do you know about that?	Uh yeah, how ya doin' there, Homer? Did you ever pass that G.I. Joe you swallowed?
You do?	Oh, Marge told me. We share everything.
Well... I'm worried about Marge and Moe. They've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. But it's not physical. So everything's great, right?	Somethin' wrong, Homer?
Can I learn it at a happy place?	Homer, it's time you learned the sad truth.
What do I do?	Although there's no physical intimacy, there's a deep spiritual connection that threatens to destroy your marriage.
You're absolutely right! Stop this ride!	Engage her feelings, become her friend... ooh, get her a Life Magazine from the week she was born. I'll always treasure mine.
Marge, my darling! Thank God you're home! I've been dying to hear your feelings!	I wanna go again, Daddy! Daddy?
Well, I can go all night, baby. I could listen to you two, maybe three, times.	Oh, I'm too tired to talk.
Catch your flight?	Homie, I'm tired. I have to get up early to catch my flight.
What's a cuckold?	Cuckold! Cuckold! Cuckold!
He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!	Where's Mom going with Uncle Moe?
I'm off!	Well, if Hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport.
Hang on, Marge, Homie's comin'! I won't let that man make you happy!	Hey wait a minute, what the Hell is that?
But I have to get to the airport to save my marriage!	Simpson, you were going a hundred in a twenty-five zone. And you're not gonna flirt your way outta this one.
You gotta get me closer, Chief!	No, why you say that?
Marge!	Just say you love me, Marge. Love me like I love you. Please?
Toilet hole.	Homer! How'd you get in here?
You leave my wife alone!	Toilet hole.
Uh... ice?	You don't deserve her! You know nothin' about Marge -- what's her favorite food?
Oh, it's true. I don't know Marge at all. I'll just go home now.	He's right.
Moe, you've won. I'll see you at baggage claim.	Shut it! Shut it!
Marge, I just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on Moe, here's my card.	Homie...
And you're my Margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.	Homer, I made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. And besides... I love you. You're my Homie-womie-romie-domie...

Woo hoo! But why?	I wanna buy the rights to that dance for a thousand dollars!
You wanna do my dance after you score?	My workman-like touchdowns never make the highlight reel. But if I add your shameless shenanigans, I'll be on ESPN every night!
Woo-hoo!	You damn straight. And I'll buy any other dances you got too.
"""L"" is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. Don't try to stop me. Just enjoy the view, sir."	I'll show myself out.

Y'ello.	How do you like me now?
I think I can fit you in. Let's see...	Homer, this is LeBron James. The fans love my dunks, but they hate my dancin'.
Lenny, can I move you from Wednesday at noon to Sunday at six?	I think I can fit you in. Let's see...
All right, all right, I'll work it out.	Homer, you know that's when I play with neighborhood dogs!

First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure.	Today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
Nicely done.	First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure.
This is either about me, or steroids.	But first, the world of sports continues its downward march into the gutter.
I'm the worst thing to happen to sports since Fox.	Everyone sucks but me! Oh yeah, cheer for Tom... Give all your love to Tom...
I wanna see him too. Maybe he can tell me how to get this off.	Homer Simpson, we work for the Commissioner of Football. And he wants to see you.
It soaked through to the other side!	I wanna see him too. Maybe he can tell me how to get this off.
Wow. At last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. You suckers, I would have done it for free!	Here's why we called you in: we want you to produce this year's Super Bowl halftime show!
Dammit! Well, I'll still do it. You suckers, I would have paid you.	Fine. Do it for free.
Dammit! Will you take a check?	Fine. Pay us.
Dammit!	No.
Every single Super Bowl halftime show has been great.	I now pronounce you Pac Man and Wife.
I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?	Oh Homie, don't worry. I'm sure you'll come up with a great idea.
Uh... uh... Oh man, I have no idea what I'm going.	We're ready for rehearsal, Mr. Simpson. So, what do we do?
I wonder if other Super Bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.	Uh... uh... Oh man, I have no idea what I'm going.
A church! Maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.	I wonder if other Super Bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.

Have you tried checking the oil filter?	Yeah. I made a great film, but I'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. I'm like Michael Moore, except I'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and God loves me. I just wish I could find some way to spread my message.
Sure, I'd be happy to tell you my problem. I've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with.	Are you even listening to me?!
Yeah... you help me, and I, in turn, am helped by you.	Wait a minute -- you've got a medium and I've got a message. Maybe God brought us together for a reason.

Go to Hell.	Dad, can I go to a rap concert? Tickets are fifty dollars.
Fine, go nuts.	Okay, what if I pay for it myself?
I love you too, Jerry.	I love you, Dad.
Son, your mother makes a very loud point...	Oh did he? Homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!

If that's true, he's gonna be like NWA -- Not Without Ass-welts.	That little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!

Y'ello?	Avenge me!
Oh yeah? Send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.	Do what I say and Bart won't get hurt.
I know what I'm doing. You can use any section of the paper. Except Metro. It's a big snooze.	Homer!
Oh son!... Taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing I've ever done.	Oh Bart, I'm so glad you're okay.
...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities.	A shirt from that rap concert... Bart must've gone to the show. But that means...
Hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which I've already lost, for the rights to Bart's story. So I have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true.	Dad!? Why did you do that?
What shirt? I don't see any shirt.	Why did you burn up your shirt?
Burn the truth. Burn the truth.	What shirt? I don't see any shirt.
You leave Maggie to me.	All right, people, we got a situation here. Your daughter's gonna blow our whole deal sky high.
Not her! She'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!	No, Lisa!
Wow, those jackets are beautiful.	Wait, before we go, I took the liberty of making these embroidered conspiracy jackets for all of us.
The lie is love.	Wait a minute. Why do we have to come clean? Nobody's been hurt. Everyone's happier with the lie.
Love the lie!	Wait just a minute.
Yeah, be cool. Like us.	That's a very noble sentiment, Lisa. But for once in your life, can't you just be cool?
Coolee, coolee cool! C'mon, fool! Be coolee, coolee cool!	Yeah, be cool. Like us.
Lisa, the world is a very complicated place. And when you get right down to it... cannonball!	Dad, I don't understand. After all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?

Two hundred bucks a couple, eh?	Lovejoy's an idiot -- his church is giving up hot gobs of gay green. He could get two hundred bucks a couple.

Hey, what can I say? I love love.	Homer, you married every gay couple in town.
Hm... where's Lenny and Carl?	Well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn.
But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars.	Don't you push them! They've gotta work that out for themselves.
Opposite? Yuck!!	Well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?
Hm. Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. What's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?	I mean a man and a woman.
Ooh, look at me. I'm straight as a one dollar bill. La de da. Ooh.	Straight.
Do you Cletus take Brandine to be...	Ooh, look at me. I'm straight as a one dollar bill. La de da. Ooh.
Wait a minute! Are you two brother and sister?	Do you Cletus take Brandine to be...
Please, Kent. Call me Your Holiness.	Reverend Simpson...
Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?	I can't. I just can't. Homer, have we started down a slippery slope, where marriage becomes so meaningless that anyone could marry anything?
If you love the Bible so much, why don't you marry it? In fact, I now pronounce you and the Bible man and wife. And you're the wife. You owe me two hundred bucks.	Well, call me old fashioned, but I believe that marriage described in the Bible--
Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. Which will put more green in the blue. The blue being my pants.	Homer, your impulsive marriages are gonna lead to a lot of divorces.
Lemme get my belt sander. Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.	Hey Saturated Fats, I came to ask you a favor.
I wasn't joking.	Very funny.
Yeah, big surprise. Hey Marge, here's another bomb: I like beer.	Oh no. No no. No. I'm just... surprised.
Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you.	Oh no. Oh no. Why would it be? I love you and I love gay marriage, so I'd be a super-hypocrite if I didn't love your gay marriage. Right?
Give it back!	It smells like cheeseburgers.
Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it.	Is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying Aunt Patty? But they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?
Correction. The first blimp that got her pregnant.	As opposed to you, who grabbed the first blimp that floated by.
Why you little...	Seriously Dad, I'm worried. You should go on a diet.
Save my place.	Why you little...
"Yeah, ""Bride of the Monster."""	It was so romantic -- like a scene from a Hollywood movie...
Got him! Uh-oh.	Marge, if you can find it in your heart to accept me for who I am, I would love to see you at the ceremony. If not, I'll see you at Homer's funeral...which should be pretty soon.
Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so.	Selma, we'll always be there for each other. I don't know about Marge, though. If she doesn't show up today...I have no non-identical sister!
And please let thy Holy Spirit open the heart of my wife. Amen.	Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so.
You handsome devil. Someday they'll let you and me get married! Can you imagine the children?	I just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married.
Next!	Veronica, in you I have found a soul mate. You are the perfect woman for me: truthful, honest, hiding nothing.
If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace.	At last I have found the yin to my yin.
People please, can we wrap this up? It's gonna rain and I've gotta get the bikes in here.	I knew it! You think everyone in the world should have a big dumb man like you!
Patty, I admire your decision. It takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge.	Well, I've learned a lesson. Just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'.
Oh, I just love it here. So many things, and so many things of each thing!	I have a little girl like you at home. That's where she stays. At home.
Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base...	Gnoooooo... mes!
Dad, where's your base?!	I'm down here, you idiot!
Eh, they'll be fine.	Don't worry about that! Someone's gotta greet the customers!
That coot happens to be my father. Please continue.	Son, you are on fire! A million times better than that worthless old coot you replaced.
Is there a chance for advancement?	How would you like to be a full-time Sprawl*Mart greeter?
Woo hoo! No pressure!	No.
Aw, dammit! Chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?	Yes. The clerk also gave me this bench warrant for Dad's arrest.
Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution.	How am I supposed to know if I'm twenty feet away?
This twenty-foot pole will make Bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. And I used my Sprawl*Mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. It'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!	Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution.
Show you what it's like in the real world!	Homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?
"Yeah, he's all ""Cowabunga, dude!"" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet."	"I like eating here with you, Dad. Especially without ""Don't have a cow, man."""
Woo hoo! That's been my dream ever since I heard it existed right now. What do I get?	Homer, would you be interested in the position of Executive Greeter?
I won't do it.	You get to work overtime without us paying you extra.
But I'm a U.S. citizen.	If you don't, we'll ship you right back to Mexico.
Dios mio!	Uh-huh. How sure of that are you?
Sorry, boy. This is the only place that's two hundred feet from Lisa but still on our property.	Sacre bleu!
Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!	Why should I go inside? The world is my toilet now.
I've never worked all night, never! And I worked at an all-night diner for three years! I slept on the grill.	It's a chance for you to catch up on all the work I'm assigning you now.
You monster!	See this? It's the bathroom key. See you in the morning.
That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!	We placed a compliance chip in the back of your neck during the company physical.
I did it! I pulled it out! And with no brain damage-amage-amage-amage-amage-amage.	That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!
Now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!	I did it! I pulled it out! And with no brain damage-amage-amage-amage-amage-amage.
Really? Then why do you still work here?!	Homer, we took our chips out years ago.
I'll be back for tall kitchen bags!	I hope you won't judge us harshly...
Mmm, hot dog.	Homer, you forgot to eat your hot dog.
Son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters.	What the hell's menopause?
And it's something to be feared -- right, Doctor?	It's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma.	Don't cry, sweetie. Everything's gonna be all right.
I know. That was for the other patients.	I'm not dead, idiot.
My thingies!	I know. That was for the other patients.
Great, another job lost to a foreigner.	Don't give up, Aunt Selma. China has thousands of baby girls who need adoption.
I just felt a chill go through my very soul.	Yes, Homer Simpson is my whole world. I love him.
How about that Selma, flying all of us to China for no apparent reason?	Yeah, those Sloppy Joes will do that.
And how 'bout me getting off work by saying I'm teaching math skills to inner city youths. Yes, there are many kinds of heroes.	How about that Selma, flying all of us to China for no apparent reason?
Hey look, a dragon.	Wait till the Drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.
I'll give you one.	Hello, Homer. Give me your peanuts and you can fly on my back.
Hey dragon! You fly like a girl!	Oh, you are a very greedy man. The other dragons shall hear of this.
You name it, oh wise mountain ape.	Homer, I'm gonna need you to do something for me when we get to China.
Nooooooo!!	You have to pretend to be my husband.
But Marge, I don't want her to be happy.	Homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform Selma's life.
Deal.	Okay, don't do it for her--
Okay, I'll do it. Because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. Ha-ha, now we're even!	Do it for me.
Wow, it makes the Lincoln Memorial look like crap.	If you look out the left side of the aircraft, you will see our monument to warrior and spicy chicken pioneer, General Gao.
And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny.	Madam Wu, these are... our children, Bart and Lisa. Yes.
Don't mention it, Miss October. But don't look at her passport, it's different.	Thank you, Mr. Simpson.
I've heard of these guys. You can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it.	These are the famous Shaolin Temple monks. They pursue spiritual peace through mastery of bare-fisted murder.
Wha?	Homer, no stop! You're thinking of Buckingham Palace!
Oh, look at him sleeping. He's like a little angel that killed fifty million people. Yes you are... yes you are!	I hope you washed your hands first.
I finally get this play!	Boys, you see what I was talking about? The greatest things can happen.
I'm a nuclear--	So, Mr. Simpson, what do you do for a living?
I'm a Chinese acrobat!	I'm a nuclear--
You guys are commies? Then why am I seeing rudimentary free markets?	Homer, we need your acrobatic skills. Only you can prevent this riot, and save our beloved Communist dictatorship.
Boy, this is easy. Maybe I am the world's greatest acrobat.	Nice chair toss. Good one, skinny. / You guys get these chairs from Regal Rents? / Boy, you're a great stacker. / Hi, Lisa. / Now that's precarious.
A.	U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.--
Ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture.	A.
Awww. She likes my eyes.	This is Homer, your daddy. Without him, I wouldn't have you.
I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right.	"Homer, I do appreciate what you did. How'd you like a little time with ""Miss October""?"
It wasn't easy, Marge -- I've missed you so much.	Homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing Selma's husband was by far the sweetest.
Is there any other kind?	Okay, one quick snuggle.
Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate.	They took my baby.
I am so sorry about what happened. But at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.	Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate.
Who told you that?	Just think about the day you found that Junior Mint in your bellybutton.
Now let's see... which one is Ling?	Let's cut him in chunks and worship the chunks.
Ling?... Ling?... Ling?...	Now let's see... which one is Ling?
Ling!	Ling?... Ling?... Ling?...
I was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. But I don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours.	Madam Wu, we both love the enforcement of pointless rules. But there's a greater joy in bending the rules to help someone who thinks all hope is gone.
But he loves me.	You may keep your baby. But you, drop the panda!
Why you little... I'll endanger you!	But he loves me.
Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough.	Feast on my shorts, stupid father man.
Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.	Yay!
"Let's see now... ""Kill spiders?"" We don't have spiders."	Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.
Aha! Huh?	Stupid spider... afraid of dying.
Baaart!	Spider poison is people poison?!
Hm, where's the pain? There it is!	Baaart!
Don't worry. If I croak, you'll marry Lenny. Or Moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game I invented. I got all the rules written down... up here.	Honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. What would the kids and I do if something happened to you?
Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years.	Homie, if you die, I'm gonna have three kids to take care of. I want you to buy some life insurance. Please?
Haven't we all?	Mr. Simpson, before we can insure you, we need to ask you some questions. Have you ever had a heart attack?
None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good.	Strokes?
Yes I am.	Are you a smoker?
Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!	You don't smoke!
If I sign it, it still counts!	Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!
My hemophilia!	If I sign it, it still counts!
Uninsurable?!	My hemophilia!
Huh?	You mean when the big tuna goes belly-up?
Way ahead of you, Marge -- I just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. They should get here soon. I paid a bundle for over-night delivery.	Well, I just think we should be building a nest egg.
Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!	I have a book from the library with the same information!
Directory assistance?	Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
Well, I'll get a lawyer on that. No, a whole team of lawyers. Who will dine on mustard flown in from the Orient.	No more directory assistance! It's not free!
I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!	Hey, hey, hey. No outside suds!
It's my money... I'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...	I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!
Marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far.	Can you help me unload this soup from the car? There was a sale, so I bought four hundred cans.
You can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?	Oh Honey, I know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away.
Hey, I earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, I'm at work busting my hump.	Last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--
Yes, President Franklin.	Give us our independence, Homer!
Well, I invented a Popsicle made of Mountain Dew.	I, uh, was never president. I invented some kind of stove.
No, I spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. I need a castle where I can be king!	Did you spend our savings on a motor home?
Dammit!	Well I hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause I'm not speaking to you!
"Kids, your mother and I have decided to take a little break from each other. While we deal with our issues, I plan to go on ""Motorhome Makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. All I need is for someone to start a show called ""Motorhome Makeover."""	Dammit!
Hey, I couldn't leave you kids. You're like my own family. Now check this place out!	I see. You were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? That's my half-assed Dad!
I've got Gameboys and caramel apples!	Oh boy!
I'll let you punch me!	I'll let you sass me!
We'll have Christmas tomorrow!	You can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
Woo hoo! Free gas!	Yay!
Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival.	She's a Roam-a-way SilverCoach. Thirty-four feet of walnut-burled freedom.
Hmmm. A place to dock, eh? I got room -- I have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot.	I've never loved you either. We use jokes to mask our pain at the death of our son. Really.
Are you crazy? Let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?	Can I bring the rest of the convoy?
It's a deal! Woo hoo!	Well, we'll give you regional beers.
Welcome, welcome. If my wife asks, you're here for a Boz Skaggs concert.	And there you have it.
These are my new friends. They like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.	What are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!	I know another place you can go -- to sleep!
That's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!	You don't belong on the lawn. You belong in your bed with your wife!
Name one way I'm not!	Well, you're not perfect either!
I seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!	No, I don't see Dad doing all that paperwork.
I'm Marge Simpson. Don't eat off the floor.	Oh boy. Let's get out of here before Dad does a bad impression of Mom.
That was my Woodstock!	And I'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your French fries. It was twenty years ago!
Oh yeah, Marge? What about my womanly needs?	"Wow, I was gonna say ""call Reverend Lovejoy,"" but I guess this could work."
Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open.	You don't take anything seriously. Not even your bankruptcy hearing!
If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!	Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open.
My RV is gone! It was more than a motor home. It was a car I could go to the bathroom in. Hey, a note.	If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!
Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone.	"""Dear Mom and Dad: We don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the RV back to the dealer."" We've got to stop them."
Don't worry about the SUVs. There's a gentle curve up ahead.	Oh, I've lost them! I can't see past all the SUVs!
I'm not a machine -- I can't just turn it on!	French it up, lover boy!
Why you little...!	First, raise my allowance.
Thank God for that Turkish freighter. Now we'll just go get 'em and...	Ah, rats.
Bring back our children, you Cyprus-splitting jerks!	Help us!
Will you raise them Christian?	Just for that, we keep your children.
Noooo!	Coptic Christian.
Wow, Marge -- once again, your Mom-ly wisdom averted disaster.	Well, if he thinks he's getting a corner piece, forget it.
And I promise I will return this RV first thing in the morning. Easy... easy... easy... easy...	Wow, Marge -- once again, your Mom-ly wisdom averted disaster.
Marge, you're taking this pretty well.	Hey, it's only money. And it did make a cool splash.
Cool.	Dude, she seemed tense, so we put a little hashish in her meal.
Look, we'll compromise. We'll go see a play...that Lisa doesn't want to see.	Play?! All plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!
Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!	Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!
Kids! Why's the cat so fat?	Hey cat, get your own pants!
Make it seven!	Let's see now... barely finished high school, you've challenged me to fight six times since the interview began...
There must have been a mistake. My body is a temple.	"""Crack, smack, uppers, downers, outters, inners, horse tranquilizers, cow paralyzers, blue bombers, green goofers, yellow submarines, LSD mach three, and trace amounts of human urine!"""
But he misread my pee! He misread my peeeee!	Guards! Remove this coked-out man balloon from my sight!
Stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. Everyone gets a prison job but me. All my best friends are guards. They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not.	Ah, Smithers, if I didn't arrest you that night in the park, I'm not gonna arrest you now.
Sometimes I go to the movies alone.	Stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. Everyone gets a prison job but me. All my best friends are guards. They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not.
I'm not supposed to be new meat. I'm supposed to have your job.	Okay, new meat, you're clean.
Oh my God! That man might be hurt! Guards, there's a prisoner in there!	No Frank Gehry-designed prison can hold me! Ha ha!
Squealin'? No, I just wanted to help him.	Nice nab, Simpson. You did the right thing squealin' on that guy.
Really? You mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?	Whatever. How'd you like to be a full-time rat?
Mr. Burns, I've thought about it, and I don't wanna be a snitch. It's not an honorable life.	Not exactly.
Well, I am a sucker for a little hat.	Now, now, there are perks. A private cell, extra dessert... and this adorable little hat.
Well... I don't know.	So we have an agreement?
Well, I would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, you've found your snitch.	It's the only way you'll survive in here.
Homer Simpson has become a snitch.	Excellent! Now, what have you got for me?
Say, is that a gang tattoo? I thought those weren't allowed.	Tell me something I don't know.
That's right, an unauthorized tattoo. I came here right away.	Yeah, it's a gang I was in as a kid. G.M.S. Galactic Mystery Solvers. The only mystery we couldn't solve was how not to grow up.
"Who? Oh, that ""my mother."" Tell him thanks."	Your uh, mother.
Well, if you really must know...	Ooh, a Tiffany's box! And the thing inside is from Tiffany's! Homie, you've never done this before. How'd you afford it?
I'm a prison snitch.	Well, if you really must know...
Sure, they're on top of the world. Then there's a big riot scene. Then I don't know, I usually doze off.	Haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?	The prison snitch is killed! And that could be you! Because you're the prison snitch!
How come nobody told me before?	Pssst. There's a jailbreak tonight.
There's gonna be a breakout tonight.	I sent you an e-vite. You never responded. Nice netiquette, jerk.
Deal!	Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!
What happened to the guards?! Okay, okay. Don't panic. Maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant.	KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT.
Marge, they're gonna kill me! I only did what I had to do to survive... in a style befitting a French monarch.	I call the balls of his feet!
Fly, Segway! Fly!	Marge, they're gonna kill me! I only did what I had to do to survive... in a style befitting a French monarch.
Marge! How did you get in here?	Homer! Homer, where are you?
Marge, c'mon!	Oh, you must be Michael's dad!
We'll be safe in the gas chamber.	Marge, c'mon!
"Marge, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Can I snitch on my heart and say... ""I love you""?"	I want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
Hold on a minute. Governor, I've been using my powers of snitching for evil. But now I want to tattle for good. This prison is a hellhole. They feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!	Done and done, sir.
The guards are sadistic and cruel!	I'll have you know I buy the finest cuts of beef.
...sleeping sweetly...	You know what I missed in the joint? Just lying here watching you sleeping sweetly... sleeping sweetly...
I won't tell if you don't tell.	...sleeping sweetly...
Listen to me! This whole building is unsafe. They cut corners everywhere. People, it's a death trap!	I won't tell if you don't tell.
How do you know the title of my prophetic vision?	"No Dad, you fell asleep in front of the TV watching ""The Towering Inferno."""
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?	Oh it's so great. We can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. I'm so proud of you. Lisa, graduating two years early, and Bart... graduating.
Well, maybe I was partying so hard with my single friends last night, I forgot the rules.	Homer, we're separated now. You can't just walk in without knocking.
Why? Is it messing you up?	Well, maybe I was partying so hard with my single friends last night, I forgot the rules.
Stupid wildlife, serves 'em right.	She's really enjoying Alaska.
Oh, Marge...	When I was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
Oh, right. Separated.	Oh, Marge...
Son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your Mom.	Meh.
She'll realize she was a fool, when...	Son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your Mom.
Hey! Come back with my patio furniture!	She'll realize she was a fool, when...
Stupid flounders. Hey, I've got a great idea. We'll find some new lady friends.	Hey! Come back with my patio furniture!
C'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. After decompressing, of course.	Stupid flounders. Hey, I've got a great idea. We'll find some new lady friends.
There's a DVD player but it doesn't work.	C'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. After decompressing, of course.
I know! It's a hover car!	There's a DVD player but it doesn't work.
You wish, loser!	All right! You guys are my new best friends.
Hey Moe, hey Moe-clone.	You wish, loser!
Boy, I think I see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. E-Z.	Watch it with the attitude, Mister. You came from my back fat!
Son, say hello to Edna.	Oh please, not this again.
Oopsie.	Son, say hello to Edna.
Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. We split up, it's all cool, I... I'll kill you!	Actually, Homer, I'm... into your lady.
Marge, I thought you'd never take me back after what I did to Krusty.	But what happens to our parents?
Exactly.	You mean get beaten up by him?
You don't know the half of it.	And I'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea.
Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue!	Homer, do something about this leak!
The water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns...	Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue!
Around the loop of death...And out the mail slot! Then it's the yard's problem.	The water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns...
Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's!	That teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!
It's raining outside.	Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's!
Stupid Homer-hating family. At least there's one place I'm always welcome.	Lousy cat.
Aw, guys. This is just what I needed.	FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW...
So what's Stephen Hawking doing here?	This ain't for you, sweat stain. It's a surprise party for Lenny, thrown by his closest friends.
So why didn't you invite me?	I live here now. You're looking at the new owner of the Little Caesar's down the street. Pizza, pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza. Sorry. That button sticks.
I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.	We couldn't tell you ahead of time, because you'd spill the beans.
I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.	Six years' planning down the drain!
Hey, watch what you say about him. I think Ray could be the one.	I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
Well, I can see I'm not wanted here.	Oh great, Homer! I bake a cake shaped like Lenny's favorite barstool, and you wreck it.
My family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! They'll all be sorry when I invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one!	No thanks, I'm on Atkins.
Finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women.	A sign!
I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.	Read the sign, pre-vert.
How did it ever come to this? I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. I don't have a friend in the world.	I got my own problems. I just lost this eye last night.
The sun.	I haven't seen this much melted cheese since I left my Billy Joel albums out in the sun.
Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am.	Hey, you wanna split this?
Mine. Oh, move your hand. I get this!	Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am.
Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again?	Hey, my name's Ray -- Ray Magini.
Ray, will you help me fix my roof?	Beats me -- I'm no marriage counselor. Just a licensed and bonded roofer.
Wait, did I add that right?	Sure, I'll help ya, under one condition -- you gotta help me finish this pitcher of beer.
To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox.	Now, for my first act as President...
Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.	DO THAT TO ME ONE MORE TIME / ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH / WITH A MAN LIKE YOU...
I think that means six more weeks of Autumn.	Homer! I woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where.	It means you have to fix the roof!
How did you know?	Knockers on route 98.
You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats.	I'm psychic. Look, I don't know if I want a roofer who hangs out in bars.
High-five!	You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats.
Ray would high-five me.	Eh, I got standards. I don't hand out high-fives like Chiclets.
Oh Ray! You came at the agreed-upon time.	Hey, Homer.
"""Impresses."" What a big word! I'm gonna look that up."	That's what I like about you, Homer. Everything impresses you.
I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.	Ah, this is gonna take some work. Tell me, was the roof in good condition when you bought the house?
Some day that bowl will overflow, and I'll be there.	I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.
Sorry about that, pal.	Yeah, okay, thank you. Why don't you go find a parade and rain on it?
One, two, three, four -- I declare a nail war!	No problem. Accidents happen.
Ned, are you okay?	Hey Homer!
Goodbye, Ray! Bye! Oh, he turned the corner. Ooh! Now I see him again!	Oh sorry man, I gotta go. This says my kid attempted something. I hate the way these things cut off.
Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute.	And why is the hole in the roof even bigger?
My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches...	It's after six -- he's not coming back. He's a lousy roofer and a flake!
Ray's not gonna like that.	I don't want to hear any more about Ray. Tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
Well if I was, we'd have taller kids!	You're not married to Ray!
You know son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware. Old man Johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. When they built this place, he hung himself.	I wish I knew.
What's in the box?	Hey Homer! Look, I just came down with a case of shingles.
Of course we are! If you wanna be.	Hey, I'm real sorry I never made it back yesterday. I hope we're still friends?
I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute.	What are you doing? Why aren't you fixing the roof?
All right, then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him.	I'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable Ray! Who, by the way, I've never even met!
Something like that.	Homer, how did you think I'd feel when I saw that?
Did you make enough for Ray?	Homer, come down for dinner.
He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.	Ray's not coming!
Now. Now. Nnnow.	He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.
Oh thank God. Where is he? Tell me!	Homer, I know where Ray is.
Ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.	Sweetheart, your friend Ray is in your head.
Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!	You have to understand -- Ray doesn't exist.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!	Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...	Homer!
What's going on? Where are my shoes?	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
What am I doing here? Let me go!	Excuse us for a moment.
Fine, I admit it. Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down!	We'll let you go when you admit there is no Ray Magini.
But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn.	Homer, no one has ever seen Ray but you.
Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me!	I saw you talking to yourself.
Ned, are you okay?	Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him.
There has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like Flanders and Bart... Wait! The bartender at Knockers.	Ned, are you okay?
Wow. My subconscious is a genius. Well, that's all very convincing, and...	"And here's the clincher... Ray Magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."""
Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc!	Actually, the technical term is electroconvulsive therapy.
Aw, what did he die of?	When you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? I wanna bring him back to life.
Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good.	Homer, that's just to bite on, not to eat--
Marge, write that down so we can have it at home.	That was rubber covered in Vaseline!
Nope, just you, Marge and Yogi Bear. Kidding!	Do you see anyone here who isn't here?
Not real.	Real.
Real.	Not real.
Real.	Real.
Fascinating!	Oh sorry, Homer. But recent historical evidence indicates that Robin Hood did not actually exist.
Oh kids, I heart you, too!	Dad!
Man, I'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. Although to be honest, I did enjoy lying down.	Oh kids, I heart you, too!
It's Ray! I see him again! Monster! You don't exist.	Hello, Homer.
The awesome power of the human mind.	Hey, no one calls me a monster and questions my existence!
So, Ray does exist?!	Check and mate.
Wait a minute. I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. Somebody owes me big!	Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all crooks. It's true.
That's a given! There's something else. Something much more else.	Well, Homer, I could make it up to you... maybe a free eye-scraping.
Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't.	Homer, can I please knock off? I've got surgery in the morning.
What are you talking about?	So as I was saying, Homer, Mondays, nine o'clock, CBS. They say everybody loves that guy, but I don't get it.
What time's the show on?	Hey, I'm just sayin', catch it while you still can.
And what's the network?	It's Monday, nine o'clock, CBS.
At what time?	CBS.
And if I wanna watch it, what day?	Nine o'clock.
And this is on the radio?	Monday. Monday, nine o'clock.
And if I wanna see it, what time should I watch it?	No, television. Mondays at nine. On CBS.
On what channel?	Nine o'clock.
What day?	CBS.
On the radio?	Monday.
Turn the television to what channel?	Television.
At what time?	CBS.
Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?	Nine o'clock on Monday.
And what time? Would be a good time to see it?	It's only on on Monday.
So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...	Nine o'clock. It's from nine to nine thirty.
So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC.	Not the radio, television.
CBS.	CBS.
On the radio.	Nine o'clock.
Television at three o'clock.	Television.
Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?	Oh, so I've been replaced by a machine?
Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!	Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?
Why did I give her a gun? But I repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. Until all the kinks are worked out.	Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!
Aw, my little boy's in love.	My heart! It hurts so much! Like it's caught in a vice!
C'mon, son. You can fight this. Do the Bartman. Do the Bartman!	I think he's having a heart attack!
Why don't you dance? Dance?!	C'mon, son. You can fight this. Do the Bartman. Do the Bartman!
Doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. They're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats.	Why don't you dance? Dance?!
"You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library."""	It's graffiti you can eatie!
Milkshake Festival. Look, you can see the booths from your window.	Where are you really going?
Lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. C'mon, everybody get in here. Hurry.	I'd better tell Dad.
Overeating. And if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. But there won't be time.	Uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?
Wow, he's just the kind of weirdo Bart needs.	Even on the nose hurts!
Son, I just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. Leave your body. Make lots of friends!	"Tough love? Of course, this has never made sense! The sign shop guy lied. Stanley! You didn't question the word ""luck?"" Now look what we've got. Thanks for the correction, that's part of the honesty."
That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?	Jimminy Kimmel! Look how much they're charging for Bart's treatment!
So that's where my soot went!	I already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner.
Even better, I'll ask him for my job back.	This fat camp can save Bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. Homer, maybe you could ask Mr. Burns for a raise.
Youth? I hate them. Secondly...	I know how we can raise money!
How much is got, Wolfgang Schmuck?	How much is costed for stay-night-of-one?
Fifty dollars? What about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?	Let's see here. I can offer you uh, fifty dollars a week.
Güten abend, my brave, Bavarian Overlords. The best wurst in town.	Come on, let's look for your Dad. Then if we have some time, maybe we'll look for mine.
NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS / AUF IHREM WEG ZUM HORIZONT / HIELT MAN FUER UFOS AUS DEM ALL / DARUM SCHICKTE EIN GENERAL /	Here's your tip, Baldylocks. If you want it, dance and sing.
EINE FLIEGERSTAFFEL HINTERHER / ALARM ZU GEBEN, WENN ES SO WAR / DABEI WAR DA AM HORIZONT / NUR NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS	They want a second verse. I hope he knows it.
Did you hear that Foxy, the Fox network Fox?	Not for long -- I'm saying goodbye to Scammer and Z-Dog. I've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
Oh boy.	When I raged against the machine, money poured out.
Marge, I know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to...	Oh boy.
Time to take out the Euro-trash.	Uh, please to have new facecloth. Schnell.
Now, everything's perfect again.	To Disneyland! Where we will heap the scorn on Goofy!
But who else needs to lose weight? Maggie? Grampa? My seldom-seen half brother Herb?	Folks, you have three weeks left on a non-refundable weight-loss treatment. So if anybody else in the family wants to use it, use it now.
Why is everyone looking at me?	But who else needs to lose weight? Maggie? Grampa? My seldom-seen half brother Herb?
I am not too fat. I'm alive, aren't I?	Why is everyone looking at me?
Oh, that's terrible.	"""PSI"" -- Poor Self Esteem. It's not ""I."" Every sign is wrong!"
Where will I sleep?	We got a long drive ahead. You wanna pull off into a motel? We'll split a room.
Cheeseburger.	What are you eating now?!
I don't wanna.	You're a catastrophe. Lemme have half of it.
Here's a corner.	I just want the cheese, I don't want the meat. I do want the meat.
You're a selfish jerk.	I mean, just bite it, don't rip it. Lemme have the whole thing. You'll get some later.
But it's my burger.	I smelled it, it has to be eaten.
Fine. I'd rather die.	I'm driving. I'll kill us.
I need change for a dollar.	Call the police.
What's the cheapest thing you've got?	No change without purchase.
Five ninety-nine?! What a rip-off! Someone should shoot you!	A two ounce bag of chips. Five ninety-nine.
Interesting. It's like a corndog without the dog.	Maybe we could shop somewhere else. There's a farm stand next door.
I don't miss meat at all. This Portobello mushroom eats like a steak. A rubbery, fungus-like steak.	Vegetables, you've been promoted from side dish to entrée.
Marge, I'm giving birth to a food baby.	I don't miss meat at all. This Portobello mushroom eats like a steak. A rubbery, fungus-like steak.
I think it's staying down. It's staying down! It's not staying down.	It's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces.
Wait. Yes, it's staying down. Oh no, it's not! Yes it is. No it's not! Yep. No. Yep. No! Yep. No! Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. no.	I think it's staying down. It's staying down! It's not staying down.
Where's my bucket?!	Stop it! You'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. Now, close your eyes...
Lisa sings so sweetly and Bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.	AND IF THAT DIAMOND RING TURNS BRASS / MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A LOOKING GLASS
And she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. Oh, thank you for this angel, Lord!	Lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!
Don't lose hope, sweetie. I'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. And that's not just the beer talking. Your father's in here too.	Why? Just because she sings like Whitney Houston brought to life?
Here you go, honey. Sing this.	Questioning the kid's sexuality -- well done.
Much of the tune is plagiarized. Now go, go, go!	How did you write a song so quickly?
You did it, sweetie!	Ah, what do you jerks know? That's a quality joke.
Of course, Sweetie. You and I are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken Hellhole.	I really do like working with you, Dad. Will you keep helping me?
I wrote it about Shelbyville, then changed the names.	But your song said you liked Springfield.
Good job, sweetie. Every time you hit that note, I'll shoot a glass with my BB gun.	LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LAAAAAAA.
Honey, our time together is precious to me. I didn't want to say anything, but I don't think I'm gonna be around much longer.	I really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, Dad.
Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win.	Really? What's wrong?
Let Daddy go talk to the man.	Sorry, sweetie. We don't have green.
May I have a word with you?	Let Daddy go talk to the man.
Is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'Cause I can make it greener...	May I have a word with you?
"Don't worry honey, the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""Moon River"" sound like a farting Orangutan."	That's Cameron. Girls go crazy over him. He's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life.
Marge, Lisa and I were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. Now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect.	Sweetie, tonight you were perfect...
My little girl likes Red Vines! You little...	Mr. Simpson, I brought those Twizzlers you asked for.
Hey, these are Red Vines. Here you go, sweetie. Daddy got you your candy.	He's crazy!
Hey, gimme a break. Living through Lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me.	Yeah. For once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? Would that be so hard?
You love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.	But Dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people.
Then would you like to see it getting made?	I don't like sausage.
Fired... me?	Dad... you're fired.
Everything I did, I did for you.	Fired... me?
Do you know the hours I worked? The people I had to yell at? The tires I had to slash?	Dad, I'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. You were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business.
It's called smoozing!	No one asked you to yell and slash!
Hey, come back! I'm calming down! We'll have family fun! Family funnnnn!	Hell, I'll even go shoe shopping.
Hey, everybody...I brought a guest.	Hey, come back! I'm calming down! We'll have family fun! Family funnnnn!
Someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.	Hey, everybody...I brought a guest.
Ha! Smart move. Soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. After I make my new client a star.	Someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.
"His name isn't Cameron anymore. He's now ""Johnny Rainbow."""	You're working with Cameron now?
I'm not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. I'm Colonel Cool! And I'm the Captain on this rocket to the stars.	Mr. Simpson, about that...
Neither. I'm both.	So, are you a Colonel or a Captain?
All right, I wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands.	Neither. I'm both.
Don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.	All right, I wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands.
Marge. Bart. Maggie. Santa's Little Helper. Lisa!	Actually, I think your father's still upset about the way things went down.
I don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.	Dad, I don't want things to be awful between us. I made you some cookies.
Oh God! Oh, they're delicious! Oh, so happy! Oh God, they're... They're gone.	I don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.
We are!	Uh, sorry hon, this is all we got. Who's next?
Flanders?	We are!
Okay Morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard.	Flanders?
Lisa.	Sure. Sure thing, Mr. S.!
Um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. It makes your eyes twinkle.	Lisa.
You're welcome.	Thanks, Dad.
I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business.	Dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. I don't care if I win, just as long as you're in my corner again.
Sure did. I'd do anything for you, honey. Especially if it's easy.	Dad, you sabotaged Cameron for me!
I'll always be there. Not even death will stop me.	Well, I think you're the sweetest Dad in the whole world.
"How 'bout ""I love you, honey?"""	Now you're getting creepy.
Kids, wanna go to the mall?! They're baking fresh Cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!	Oh. I see. Well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause I'm not driving you.
Oh, I love you, Dumpster-bons.	After 'em!
Oh, big surprise. The fat guy's eating garbage.	Dad?!
"""Left Below."" Ooh, a ""He Is Risen"" production!"	Leave your body, Seymour. Leave your body.
Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him.	Church? I'd rather play golf on the holiest day of the week.
Left below?! Where have I heard that before?	It's the Rapture, Shawna. The Rapture. The virtuous have gone to heaven, and the rest of us have been... left below!
It's everywhere!	It's the title of the movie.
This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two.	Why did I choose to be gay?
Marge... what if the Rapture is coming and I haven't led a good enough life? I could be... left below!	This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two.
"Yeah, I'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease. Now how about a little ""rapture"" for Mama?"	Sweetie, don't worry. God wouldn't spring the Rapture on us unannounced. He'd send us signs, like, I don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving.
Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship.	Ooh, I could be the Rachel to your Jacob.
Marge is right -- the Rapture isn't coming! There haven't been any ominous signs!	Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship.
Blood is raining from the sky!	You too.
Judgment day is at hand.	This ain't personal, I just love to scrimshaw.
Begat. Uh, do you have any books on the Rapture?	Can I help you? We're having a sale on Bible magnifying glasses.
I'll take everything you've got!	Yes, this one is fifteen per cent off.
No, thank you.	"And would you like to take advantage of our ""Friends of Flanders"" discount?"
Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh.	Homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. And you're reading books! Word books! What's going on?
This whole deal is scientifically proven. The Book of Revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at The Last Supper...	Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh.
...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...And you get...	This whole deal is scientifically proven. The Book of Revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at The Last Supper...
"He writes ""3150518"" on the board."	...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...And you get...
Up bup bup!	Three million, one hundred and--
Three fifteen p.m., May 18th! That's when the Rapture will be!	Up bup bup!
A week? That's...seven days from now!	May eighteenth? That's one week from today!
The world will end next week! Spend your children's college fund! Thaw that turkey now!	A week? That's...seven days from now!
Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!	This is Kent Brockman reporting live from downtown Springfield, where overweight doomsayer Homer Simpson is predicting the world will end... next Wednesday! Homer, what turned you from sad drunk to mad monk?
Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted.	That must mean you're right about the Rapture too.
Uhhh...	I see. Well, we have thirty seconds left -- any other cuckoo yip yap?
"Here's one -- Revelation 6:13. Just before the Rapture, ""the stars will fall to the Earth."" So all you hippies out there might want to for that one."	Uhhh...
Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane.	Homer, I'm glad you're getting exercise, I just wish it wasn't crazy exercise.
Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.	"Dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. Yet. A hundred years, global warming... we're goners. But for now, do you think you could lighten up on this ""left below"" stuff?"
When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here.	'Cause that girl's school says I can't do that no more.
Exactly. It came to me in a vision. Or maybe it was a drunken haze. Or, possibly, an ice cream headache.	That's Springfield Mesa! It's fifteen miles north, past the Warren Harding Memorial Through-hole!
No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested.	Well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-Rapture party.
All right, everybody. Pair up with a Rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity.	No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested.
But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this.	Dad, please don't go through with this. All through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong.
C'mon, Lisa. No one in this family is being left below.	Lisa's going! We're all going!
Don't worry, Dad! There's a bus coming for you! Drive, drive!	Wait for me! I'm a-comin'!
Okay, guys. Get ready! We're just seconds away!	Wait for me! Wait for me!
Goodbye, stupid Earth!	Two... one...
Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...	There appears to be some delay!
Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...	Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
Wait for it... wait for it...	Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?	Homie... I'd better start dinner.
Aw, that's my girl.	Dad, if you'll recall, I never believed in you, not for one second.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.	Hey, Fatwad! Here's another thing you didn't predict.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh?	Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.
Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?	Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh?
...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! Twelve apostles... but Jesus was at the last supper too! This changes everything.	Hey, you with the tempura -- your arm broken?
Multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six...	...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! Twelve apostles... but Jesus was at the last supper too! This changes everything.
Wake up! The Rapture is coming in half an hour! There's no time to waste! Marge, grill a chicken! No, make sandwiches! And some Kettle Chips would be nice! Original, not barbecue!	Multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six...
Forget school! We have to get to the mesa!	Yeah, school.
But my prediction says--	We're not going anywhere, except to bed!
Stupid family... won't even come to my Rapture... I went to Lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.	You couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! Now good night!
Three... two... one...	Stupid family... won't even come to my Rapture... I went to Lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
Oh, I'm wrong again. I'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!	Three... two... one...
Woo hoo! I was right!	Oh, I'm wrong again. I'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!
And there's the Earth. So beautiful with your many rings.	Woo hoo! I was right!
I'm comfortable like this.	Homer Simpson! Welcome to Heaven. Now let's get you some clothes, huh?
How come it's not open yet?	This is our nature walk... our pedicure hut... our state-of-the-art showroom, tonight featuring Los Lobos. And over there is our water slide, that's coming next year. It's gonna be super fantastic.
Hm...	And the best part of Heaven is, anything you wish for, you get... lickity split!
Thanks. Listen... could you do me one more favor?	Okay, just for that, your room's next to the kiddie pool. All right, Mister smarty-head exploder?
Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash.	So if you need further assistance, just call the front desk and ask for Andre, okay?
I could.	You know you could wish for some.
Wait! Before you go, there's one thing I gotta know. What happened to my family?	I could.
Lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. Really top notch. But I can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering.	Homer, what's wrong?
Oh, he'll be fine. And you could still spare my family by--	Oh, don't tell me about family suffering. My Son went down to Earth once. I don't know what you people did to Him, but He hasn't been the same since.
Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy.	Pass.
Screw you, Dino! You squandered your gift!	Hey, what's the big idea, pally? Why so crabby?
Uh-oh.	Screw you, Dino! You squandered your gift!
I'm sorry. But Heaven isn't Heaven without my family in it.	Squandered my gift? I made sixty-eight albums.
Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so.	What do you want, Homer?
Superman did it.	But it's already started. To do what you're asking, I'd have to turn back time.
No, I'm in a good place with that.	You want me to help you with your alcoholism?
Yeah, I'll definitely read those later.	Why don't you just take these pamphlets?
Now listen, if you could just see your way clear to...	Yeah, I'll definitely read those later.
But what are these wings? Oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back.	It was all just a dream.
Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me...	The Warren Harding Through-hole never seemed so long.
Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was.	Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me...
Ah... this is heaven.	Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was.
Prison overcrowding, I've got a solution for that. Oh my God! U-S-A! U-S-A!	Humorist David Sedaris takes a wry look at overcrowding in America's prisons.
Free movie tickets?! I feel like Roger Ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!	Hey, I won four free movie tickets! And it starts in half an hour!
How about this guy?	A TV shark is not a babysitter!
Shut up, Flanders, I need a favor. Would you mind watching Maggie for a while? It would only be until later.	Howdy, Homer. You here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?
"Come on Flanders, doesn't that ""Bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? Why won't you love me?"	Oh, sorry, but I promised to rewind videotapes for the poor.
Thanks, Ned.	All right, neighbor, I'll baby-sit.
You wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?	Thanks, Ned.
Makes sense.	Yeah, so I can't see my own shrinky dink.
This theater sucks. My seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!	Honey, you can be anything you want to be.
Yes.	Would you care for a segment?
I've had enough -- I'm leaving!	Mom, I don't wanna read -- it's the weekend!
I'm stuck. Why did I eat that apple segment?	I've had enough -- I'm leaving!
Scantily-clad co-eds?	What are you kids laughing at? And if you say Jimmy Fallon, I'll know you're lying.
Why you little... I'll teach you to have a libido!	Scantily-clad co-eds?
Wait'll I tell everyone about this! I'll feel important without drinking! That'll be weird.	He doesn't even know what's going on!
What a combination -- hot chicks and stupid Flanders.	Wait'll I tell everyone about this! I'll feel important without drinking! That'll be weird.
Yep, and nobody's tellin' him. Not even his good buddy God.	And you say Mr. Flanders remains completely ignorant of their dot-kama sutra?
Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders.	Boy, nothin' is sexier than still photos in a girlie magazine. wha?
Hey Moses, are you a loser?	Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders.
Yes I am, Homer.	Hey Moses, are you a loser?
Son, I need to pee, but I can't stop watching. Fetch me a bottle.	Oh yeah! They're just what my laptop needed!
Uh, we're watching the latest photos from Mars. Ho, great stuff. Worth every billion.	What are you two doing?
Well that's obvious. He doesn't even know.	It's happening in Ned's house! Why would he allow that?
"Uh, I'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. It's called ""Plops"" and..."	C'mon. You tell him right now. Ned, Homer has something to tell you.
Okay. Flanders, you see...	You know what I mean.
Ned, I had no choice. It was just so funny!	Homer, is this true?
Mmm... soggy br--	"The Bible says ""cast your bread upon the waters."" But all I got was a bunch of soggy bread."
...ead.	Don't say it, Homer. This is not the time.
You're right. But you know who the real victim is here? Ned.	Dad, I don't think you realize what you've done. You've totally humiliated the best friend the Simpsons ever had.
Oh yeah.	That's what we've been trying to tell you!
What's this? Goodbye Springfield...	Oh yeah.
Last-diddily-ast? He's gone! And it's all someone's fault!	The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
Don't worry, Marge. I've taken every precaution.	Well, Homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. But at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?
Um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, I want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all...	Damn straight. Clay Roberts. I coach wrestling, so everyone calls me coach.
"Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" And he always lets me win!"	That's coming from next door!
Hey Coach, do you mind turning down the music? My baby's trying to take a nap.	"Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" And he always lets me win!"
Lookin' good... feel the burn...	Encourage me!
You're a god!... I can't think of any more!	Louder!
Go! Go! Go!	"Just say ""Go! Go! Go""!"
Hey, you knocked out my power. How am I supposed to eat without watching TV?	Chop Shop! Chop Shop!
When are you gonna stop poking me? Will it be soon?	Yeah, something tells me you won't starve. Huh? Huh Chief? Huh?
But I siphoned that gas from Flanders! Flanders...	Relax, dumbass. Oh, by the way -- I borrowed some gas from your car. You dumbass.
Like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.	Huh? What are you doing? Reminiscing... like a woman?
Oh, I was just driving around the mid-Atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and I just... oh, who am I fooling with my awesome lies? I want you to come back to Springfield.	Homer? What are you doing here?
After the party.	Why? So you can make me a laughingstock again?
No, I wanna make you a respecting stock. I don't know if you've noticed, but I've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years...	After the party.
Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit...	Well, that is true. In fact--
...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. Oh, Ned, I don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?	Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit...
I am a little pudgy. You got me. Yeah.	Really? Well that's too bad, 'cause I'm not leaving. See, I like this place, and I've already got Fatso here broken in. Ain't that right, Fatso?
I saw my advantage and I took it. That's what heroes do.	Why'd you do that? I was beggin' for mercy.
Okay, Ned. Get ready for your welcome home surprise.	I saw my advantage and I took it. That's what heroes do.
Maybe. We don't know that for sure.	Did you steal the organ from the church?!
Go nuts.	It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
Flanders. Okay, that's it. Really irritating!	Go nuts.
Boy, I can't believe you got expelled. Well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!	Bart, I'm sick of playing the tomfool. You are hereby expelled from Springfield Elementary!
And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the Army. Where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge.	Bart, I love you. But sometimes I don't love your choices. Now we have to find another school for you.
How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?	Think of the leg up you'd have!
Get 'em from the smoke detector.	I need two double A batteries. Now!
The smoke will wake us up.	What if there's a fire?
Catholic school, eh...?	Catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
That'll straighten you out, boy. There, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to Hell!	Catholic school, eh...?
Classic Grampa.	My pacemaker!
I didn't need that new fact! Now I forgot who won Bud Bowl Eight. Boy, I'm pulling you outta that crazy school!	You do?
No meat?! What do they eat, light bulbs?	Don't you touch bead one! Homer, maybe we should be concerned. Catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on Friday...
Bart! What the Hell are you saying?	Yes'm. Anima Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto...
Mickey Mouse's dog?	That's Latin, Dad. The language of Plutarch.
Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?	No, Plutarch. He chronicled the lives of the Roman emperors.
You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!	We're having our monthly pancake dinner. Care to join us?
Log Cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. Blessed art thou among syrups and...	You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son.	¡Que buenos cake-os de pan-o!
Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.	I understand. But can it wait 'til after Bingo?
That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.	Bingo.
Bingo!	"How 'bout you just say ""Yay, I won."""
You have to cheat.	I've never seen such masterful bingo playing. What's your secret, Homer?
Uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know...	You have to cheat.
Celibacy?! I was talking about the meat on Friday thing. Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video.	I'll admit the vow of celibacy is one of our sterner challenges.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?	Well that's true, but if you do break a rule, you can always find absolution in the sacrament of confession.
Okay, let's make some magic here. I wiped a booger on your shirt, I made a dog and a cat kiss, I swiped a bolted-down TV from a Holiday Inn...	If you truly repent, then yes.
"...I coveted the wife in ""Jaws 2,"" I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight million times and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."	Sorry Mom, but this is the Catholic church. Chicks don't have any authority here.
Woo hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!	"...I coveted the wife in ""Jaws 2,"" I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight million times and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?	Um, not quite, Mr. Simpson. I can only absolve you if you're a Catholic.
Woo hoo!	...but it ends with bread and wine.
Look, Marge, I know I was supposed to yell at that Priest, but he's so cool. He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!	Homer, you've been out all night! And you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. Were you at that Catholic Church?!
Marge, no one is saying twelve. Nine, ten, tops. See...	I knew they'd try to convert you! That's what they do! Well I'm not having another twelve kids.
Marge, relax. I've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion.	Forget it! And you know, I went to a Catholic wedding once. The incense ruined my pantsuit!
Wow! Up here, that feels good!	where's Homer and Bart?
Transubstantiation!	Yes, Homer?
Marge, what are you doing here?	Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip.
Marge, you bring Bart home now! Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again.	Hello, Homer.
Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!	It wasn't a fair fight! Your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting Cinemax.
Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?	Well, I'm gonna show Bart that Protestants can be hip too. How do you like those croutons?
Bwa?	Strange as it sounds, Dad, I agree with you.
Hop in, boy! We'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt.	My hive! My trademark hive!
C'mon Broncos... you can do it...	We got a real nail-biter here at Mile-High Stadium, the Broncos down by one, and thirty seconds left on the clock.
The Broncos won?! Why didn't I bet on them, like Professor Pigskin told me to?	Oh looky there, Denver just won the ballgame...
He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!	Who's Professor Pigskin?
Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.	How is that possible?
"I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."	Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
I have money!	I get it. Every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. Eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think Professor Pigskin is always right! That's when they ask for your money.
"A scam? Not according to ""Eddie F. from Tucson,"" or ""Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan."""	Dad, it's a scam!
...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.	Look, all I'm saying is, you really should think twice before...
Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful.	...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
Hey, I didn't bet any of our money. I just borrowed some from him.	Dad, how much money did you bet?
It's not my fault the Raiders lost, it's Professor Pigskin's!	Don't worry. We can hammer out a payment plan.
But the pig!	If he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.
Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week.	"Yeah. It's called ""Lemony Lick-It: A Series Of Horny Events""."
All right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house.	Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week.
They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow. How am I gonna get rid of Marge and the kids?	I didn't say anything about gay.
Thanks, Moe!	Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars...
It got your hopes up, didn't it?	I want to see Santa. He can explain why he gave me a PlayStation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
I swear.	Homer, before I take the kids, I want you to swear you're not up to something.
Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.	And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
Guys, get out of here!	"What is this, a reunion of ""Fahrenheit 9 on 1?"""
Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie.	Homer, how'd you ever get Marge to go along with this?
Are you guys almost done?	Look, I know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't .
Um... you're in the wrong house, lady.	Is this a snuggle film?!
Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say.	How could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!
I owed the mafia money...	All right.
When will you be back?	Away from you.
Who's gonna watch the kids?	I don't know.
Me? But I'm the father.	You are.
Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!	Boy, Homer. I've never seen Mom this mad.
Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt.	Bye Bart! I love you, Lisa! Sleep tight, Maggie! Today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!
Kids, I'm sure your mother will be back soon.	Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt.
Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles.	She should be back now. It's dinner time.
"You mean ""Homer's famous marinara sauce."""	All we've got is ketchup.
Where's your sense of magic and wonder?	No. I mean ketchup.
C'mon, Marge. When are you gonna call?	Where's your sense of magic and wonder?
Let it ring. Play hard to get. That's hard enough!	C'mon, Marge. When are you gonna call?
Oh-my-darling-I-love-you-please- forgive-me.	Let it ring. Play hard to get. That's hard enough!
Moe! What are you calling me for?	Hey, Homer.
Well, what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?	You told me to call. You wanted to see if your phone was workin'.
Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!	Well ain't you got call waitin'?
Uh-oh. That might have broken the phone. I'd better call Moe.	Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!
Moe! Will you get off the line!	Hey, Homer.
Oh, Marge. What a pleasant surprise.	I guess I'd better tell them I'm coming home.
No, no. It's not gonna be like that, I swear.	"I'm at a rest stop south of Springfield. I know, you're sorry now. Then you'll buy me some Kwik-E-Mart flowers, maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have ""testing bites,"" and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self."
Ew, lemon cream! You're goin' in the Marge pile. I mean I love you so much...	No, no. It's not gonna be like that, I swear.
Hello? Marge? Where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?	Good girl. Yes, yes. This animal means you no harm. She's a sweet old Florida manatee. Also known as a sea cow or a dugong.
Does the pizza guy take a check? If so, where do we keep the checks? And lastly, how do you write a check?	Hello, Marge?
Gotta find your Mom. Gotta find your Mom.	Yeah, that'll be good for business.
It was hard enough gettin' you in there. I'm not lettin' you out.	And treated like I deserve.
Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?	Oh yes, señora left for the coast with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.
Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them.	Ew.
Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!	Country cousins? Are they rubes? 'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.
We'll say it's all our birthdays!	Can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?
Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.	We're having lasagna and Caesar salad.
Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better.	So, Homer, how are you?
She, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner.	And how is our lovely Marge?
It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned.	Oh, why that's terrible!
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the outhouse again.	It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned.
You lost that first game to hustle me!	We've gotta tell Dad! Where is he?
Marge?	What am I supposed to do, bury them at Arlington?
These are for you.	Homer?
Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry.	Ooo.
I love you, Marge.	Homie, I accept your apology.
Wha...?!	But I'm not coming back yet.
You're needed at home!	I've found a place where I'm needed.
You're needed at home!	You're needed at home!
Well, that's very reasonable.	I'm sorry, Homie. I just can't find it in my heart to come back right now.
You stole my wife! I'll kill you!	Well, that's very reasonable.
Wow. I can see why she loves you.	Something a strong, passionate woman like her needs: a purpose.
You know everything.	She doesn't love me. She's just trying to find herself.
And what a man!	I don't know everything. I'm just a man.
Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. Is Marge saving them or killing them?	And what a man!
Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that.	Saving!
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?	Aw man, I just wish we could see their tears.
Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!	In fact, they're bigger than us.
Rubes.	You're a brave man. And we respect two things: bravery and tattoos that look like barbed wire. Let's go.
Catch me if you can!	What did you call us?
Manatees -- defend!	Catch me if you can!
Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.	Homer, are you okay? How many fingers am I holding up?
Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes...	Oh, my sweet, sweet Homie! You sacrificed yourself for the manatees.
Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.	I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband.
Woo hoo!	And I always will.
Hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed R and R?	Amen.
Yes... but I've got a friend who owes me a solid.	Don't you have to be back at work?
Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee.	It's seven a.m. What are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
Stupid best friend Flanders.	Okily-dokily, here's some French roast, now I'll go make toast.
Stamps? Those are for snail mail! Stamps rule! I mean suck!	A stamp museum?
I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals.	"Well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. What ever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""?"
What man would want this now?!	We have to stop all this construction. The noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the Jell-o.
Two four six eight! I hate stamps! They aren't great!	What man would want this now?!
Okay, how about this? Seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. Everyone forget that.	Two four six eight! I hate stamps! They aren't great!
Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking.	Instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
Okay, just let me clear some space.	Oh sure you can, sweetie. Just don't make a habit of it.
Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning.	So that's why I've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
I, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter.	Oh, wait a minute. There's no batteries in this thing.
There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.	Tonight I want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... Homer, stop that!
No soldier left behind.	There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.
Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you.	Homer, can you help me out here?
I can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. Why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?	Well, I heard they finished the stamp museum. That could be fun.
Lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as I have, consistency is something, something that, something I love you, Bart.	Dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house.
I thought it was twenty.	Hey, Simpsons! That'll be forty bucks!
I can't believe you're making money off this!	Yeah, that's per axle. Park over there in Carl Four. No early outs!
No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --	You guys need water?
Butter face.	Thanks to me, Katherine Blodgett, we have non-reflecting glass.
That's bull man.	And I'm jumbo shrimp! Maximum two servings!
"Oh, and that Dr. Hibbert was so boring... ""Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... Homer, we must discuss your test results... Homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."	I don't care what Apu was in a past life. In this life, he's a blabbermouth!
Lisa!	I didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.
You see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends.	Lisa!
Oh, and I spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run.	I know. I'm sorry.
Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?	Is it the chair?
Tragically, yes.	Grampa?
Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up.	What if we show Lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? Hm?
Don't worry, he's not showin' up.	"Well, I hope he's accompanied by the ""How was your day"" monster, and the ""Foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
Finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house.	All I see is an empty grave. Why don't you fill it, ya lazy bastard?
You know that racecar bed I made him?	What about Bart's bedroom?
The brakes are shot.	Yeah.
Learn to drive, boy!	Ow.
Uh... this is all I could find.	Did you bring those home movies of your daughter I asked for?
Why you very little...!	Uh... this is all I could find.
Stationary camera.	Who was filming that scene?
Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake...	Four thousand dollars?!
Run, Marge! Start the car!	Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake...
And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!	I'm not chasing you, Mr. Simpson.
Lisa! Lisa!	Oh, I don't work here. I-I was just visiting another security guard that died. Bye now.
Although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents.	Hey Mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?
Marge, we owe her the truth!	Homer!
Lisa, honey, please wake up. If you do, I'll get you a new pony.	We're always just a concussion away!
Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.	New pony?
I forgot to floss this morning!	That's not what you do with a hymnal. Homer!
Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep.	Heal my scabs, Lord!
Aw, poor Maggie.	Oh, sugar-booger!
I know, and you did, and you're great.	Homer, don't touch her! You've never had chicken pox.
Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?	Oh, I'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! It could leave you sterile down there.
You're better than that.	Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?
Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.	You're better than that.
Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area!	I'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox.	Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple?
Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?	Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
So you want Maggie to infect your kids?	Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!
And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?	"You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!	Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors...
Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box!	...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!	...normally I'm not one to laugh at a man's urinary blockage, but, you shoulda seen it... oh, there he is.
Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!	I never drank one of these without a cigarette in it!
Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!	Almost anyone's got a chance now.
Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!	You think that's traumatic.
I have to do this for work.	Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!
Marge, what's happening to me?	All right, we get it!
I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.	Oh Homie, you got chicken pox. But how?
I'm so itchy!	I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
Mmm... Homer-oats.	You sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! Homer!
Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying.	Stop eating the oatmeal! That's the third tub you've eaten!
Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye!	Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying.
"I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads."""	Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye!
"Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq."""	"I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads."""
Trucks are like big cars.	"Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq."""
Okey-doke. And you are...	I have a message for your wife: stop sleeping with my husband!
Will she know what this is regarding?	The wife of your wife's lover!
That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff.	You moron! Marge is having an affair with Kirk!
This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!	Never mind about those two. Just answer me one question. How did your wife's bra end up in my husband's bed?
Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?	This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!
Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?	Oh boy, am I beat! If you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!
I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk?	How could you ask me that?
You're not saying no.	Homer, you're crazy!
I'm still not hearing no.	Fine... No!
Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!	No, no, no!
Gladly.	Get out of this house!
I came to get my mail.	Dad, I thought Mom kicked you out of the house.
Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!	I came to get my mail.
I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.	Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!
Well, I'd better go.	Lisa, we don't need to know how. It's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war.
You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park.	Where are you staying?
Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad.	So, I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize.
Where's my bucket?	Where's my apology?
Why you little...	This is all my fault! I planted Mom's bra in Milhouse's parents' bed!
Okay.	Just do it! Trust me!
Make it two kajillion.	Mom... Dad. I'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.	Homer!
Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.	Well, I guess you showed you do trust me after all.
I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.	I'm afraid your son is in a deep, deep coma from which he will never emerge.
"Wow. A robot kid would be a blast. We can confuse him and make his head explode. ""This statement is a lie. But if it's a lie then it must be true. But if it's true, then it must be..."" Kaboom!"	A robot?
Now, I'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. Do you think I could...	Time to destroy the one who did this to me.
Why you metal...!	Sure. Let him have it.
And he's great with the neighbors.	David is so helpful...
Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!	More waffles, Father?
David, you're by far the best son I've ever had. Uh-oh.	Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!
Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.	Did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
Here, make me a kitty!	I will comply.
Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream.	I hate going to the zoo. I feel so sorry for the animals.
I'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. I hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us.	David and Bart just aren't working out. We have to do something.
The sad part is, there were times when I actually had feelings for you. I almost felt I was your father.	I'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. I hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us.
David feels, and your mother will agree when I tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it.	What are you talking about?
No toys!	We're still going to the toy store, right? And I can pick out as many toys as I want?
Heyyy, it's Bart! Super!	Lava-tron.
You wanted to believe the lie!	You told me he was at culinary school!
Those were my good pants.	To get me, you'll have to go through your fa...
This stinks! I've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.	Well, the important thing is we're a family again.
Woo hoo!	I'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
Suckers.	Woo hoo!
Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus.	Please don't accept this invitation, Dad. Hunting is cruel.
They look a little green.	And there's bananas in that tree up there.
Yes I am! I mean...	You can't escape me, Simpson -- you're not smart enough!
Oh no! I've been killed!	Yes I am! I mean...
Outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. Hee-hee.	Oh no! I've been killed!
Marge! You saved me.	Done and done!
What was that for?	Marge! You saved me.
Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions.	Staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?	I'm turning you into your costumes!
Marge isn't home.	Oh, this isn't fair. I wasn't wearing a costume.
They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people.	But what will junkies do drugs under?
Ooh! Ooh! I wanna ride the bumper cars!	They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people.
I call the red one!	Whoa, Sir, we're dismantling this ride. It's not safe.
A strongman? Are you for sale? 'Cause I need someone to throw a birdbath at my neighbor.	Uh-hmm. I believe you.
Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning.	Robusto is not for sale! But would you like to buy my last dumbbell?
I'll give you five dollars for it.	Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning.
Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight...	Homie, if I buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?
Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana...	Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight...
You want me to ride a whatsickle built for who?	I'll take it! I can't believe I own a tandem bike!
But I'm watching television. A lot of people worked hard on this show!	Our tandem bicycle! When I bought it, you said you'd ride with me.
Three hundred and six, three hundred and seven...	Moms don't get lonely.
Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast!	I'd love to! I'll be right... wait... Are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
Hello, Domino's? What do you mean, you're not open? No, you call me back during business hours! I'll show you who's a recorded message!	Awww. I'll be right down.
Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?	Don't do that... that hurts. Careful, careful.
Just liftin' this dumbbell.	Homer, how'd your right arm get so strong?
Forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!	Just liftin' this dumbbell.
I'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn.	Stop the showcase!
Wha? Hey, you...	Oh no you don't! I just got an idea.
Excuse me, Mr. Bartender sir, may I have a sugar-free ginger ale? And uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds.	I got a new liver, and I'm breakin' it in.
I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!	Where are you two going?
Negatively, I assume.	Uh-huh. And how will this affect your job at the power plant?
Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!	Oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. Have fun!
Okay.	Forget about it, Homer. She's dead to you now.
I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home.	It's still happening!
Did she say anything else?	Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin.
Oh Marge, I love her so much.	Yeah. She said to shut up, and stop asking questions and listen to Moe.
He looks tough.	"Now Homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? Your first opponent is Lefty ""The Righty"" Leftwright."
I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.	Yeah, he only lost once: in his fight against illiteracy.
Moe, I'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing I barely liked in the first place.	I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.
Sorry, Moe. The place for my arm is around my wife.	C'mon, Homer! We can make it all the way to the quarter-finals for the Eastern Division, Class B, over thirty-five, Amateur Grouping!
SWEET HOME ALABAMA...	SWEET HOME ALABAMA / WHERE THE SKIES ARE SO BLUE
LORD, I'M COMING HOME TO YOU / Alabama!	SWEET HOME ALABAMA...
Marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world.	LORD, I'M COMING HOME TO YOU / Alabama!
I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed.	I thought it was arm wrestling.
That song is a pop music footnote! I didn't say stop!	OOH, MY LITTLE PRETTY ONE, MY PRETTY ONE / WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE ME SOME TIME, SHARONA / OOH, YOU MAKE MY MOTOR RUN, MY MOTOR RUN / GOT IT COMIN' OFF O' THE LINE, SHARONA / NEVER GONNA STOP, GIVE IT UP, SUCH A DIRTY MIND / I ALWAYS GET IT UP FOR THE TOUCH OF THE YOUNGER KIND / MY, MY, MY, AYE-AYE, WHOA! /
'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY...	M-M-M-MY SHARONA
Kids, this is the holiest night of the year. Tomorrow is Father's Day, and that makes tonight Father's Day Eve.	Mid-June?
JOY TO THE WORLD, A FATHER'S BORN / LET ME RECEIVE GREAT GIFTS!	Hey Simpson, are you gonna steal the sign?
No Father's Day Eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... Daddy Claus?	"Dad, there's no such thing as ""Father's Day Eve."""
Is there a Super Bowl Bunny?	Fine, there's a Daddy Claus.
Oh, can I come with you? I know I can't.	Bart... Lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
What a great Father's Day!	Mm-hmm!
A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.	Here you go, Dad. I hope you like it. I've forgotten what it is.
Fear not, m'lady! Captain Dash Superstud is here with his small tool!	A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.
Bart, this is the greatest present I ever received. To open another gift now would be like following the London Philharmonic with Jessica Simpson. Whatchu got, Lisa?	Oh Captain, you're so handy!
What the Hell is this?	Bart, this is the greatest present I ever received. To open another gift now would be like following the London Philharmonic with Jessica Simpson. Whatchu got, Lisa?
Oh, it's heartfelt. There's no escaping that. Thanks, honey.	What do you think? Huh? Huh? Pretty heartfelt, huh? Huh?
No, no, no, it's great. I'm done with it now.	You didn't like it, did you?
Aw, isn't that cute?	Lisa, sweetie, I think your father would like to put your book up on the fridge where everyone can see how nice it is.
It's not my fault! Lousy magnet.	Oh Dad, how could you?
Yeah, but I know how to win women back. I even won you back after I lost our wedding album in a bar bet.	She's not going to get over this quickly -- I know women.
I mean I will win you back.	You what?!
I'm sorry I made you feel bad, honey. But I'm gonna show you just how much I care about your feelings. One adult and one baby, please.	Baruch atah adonai eloheem melech h'olom...
Her first words! Play along. It's fifty cents less for babies!	I'm not a baby! A baby is zero to two.
How you doin'? So... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?	I'd rather not go than lie.
Does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?	Your daughter broke a window, upended an ashcan, and hurled a Thermos-brand thermos onto the street!
Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up.	I'm afraid Lisa's rage stems from extraordinary disillusionment with a parental figure. In this case, her father.
Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?	Mr. Simpson, Lisa is at a crucial juncture. If she doesn't see her father as a positive role model, she could hate men for the rest of her life.
I don't know. What happened to the last Safety Salamander?	"The school is looking for a new ""Safety Salamander"". When Lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender."
I can do that!	Uh... he fell asleep in the suit and suffocated.
Okay, Lisa. Time for Daddy's big surprise!	I can do that!
Yeah. Now, I'm off to bring safety to Springfield Elementary and win back your love!	I guess.
Sorry, Bart!	Salamander awayyy!
The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.	Sorry, Bart!
Then what protects you if we crash?	School buses don't have seat belts.
Stop this bus!	A metal bar at tooth level.
Look, Lisa. I made safety happen!	My teeth!
Safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.	Look, Lisa. I made safety happen!
Son-of-a... Questions? Comments?	Safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.
"Did I hear ""where are the fireworks?"" 'Cause heeere they are!"	Are you a girl? 'Cause I don't see a sala-wiener.
Every man for himself! Trample if you must!	Ahhhh!
Safety... safety... die for safety.	Every man for himself! Trample if you must!
So, sweetie, am I your hero again?	Safety... safety... die for safety.
Now honey, you know Daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore.	Janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. Couldn't you be that kind of dad?
But I'll never stop trying to redeem myself in your eyes.	Oh, yeah.
This looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!	Springfield needs a hero and it needs one now!
No, she's not.	My mother's still in the car.
Only three?	Three cheers for our new hero!
That's more like it!	Okay, six!
Please, you're embarrassing me.	Hip, hip hurray! Hip, hip hurray!
What can I do? I'm only one man.	Dad, we've got to do something.
Are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? I read an email that said there was.	Lincoln was only one man.
Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!	Look, as the Safety Salamander, you are beloved by all. And if you were the Mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do.
And I'll find out what a Mayor does!	And I will be your campaign manager!
Expand my brain, learning juice!	And I'll find out what a Mayor does!
Oh, I hate press conferences.	Expand my brain, learning juice!
Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna.	Homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that Salamander suit. You look like the mascot for some horrible Southern college.
"Today marks a new dawn for Springfield. This salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" And those eggs are ready to hatch!"	Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna.
Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls.	Uh, what special powers would a salamander bring to the office of mayor?
Bloop, bloop, bloop. Bloop, bloop, bloop.	Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls.
Why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?	Mr. Simpson, what about those photos of you strangling your child?
Now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!	Why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
Hey, people may not love Homer Simpson, but they love this suit. Just like they love their stupid American flag.	I, um, I don't feel so good, Blue.
It's the smell of impending victory.	What's that smell?
A little.	Did you just vomit in that suit?
No, but I swam in it.	Have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?	I'd better wash that thing. It's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
That's weird. He started off as an egg.	No!
That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all...	Sir, how would you restore our city's crumbling infrastructure?
What the? It must have shrunk when my wife washed it!	That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all...
That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now.	Si, si.
Uh, well, my son is here too. Let's meet him now.	That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now.
Please, stop throwing fruit!	We're sick of you and your hatchlings!
Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?	Well, Dad, you tried to make this town a better place. And no matter what, that makes you my hero.
I can't believe I lost after Ben Affleck campaigned day and night for me.	Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?
Whups, be careful of my tail.	Yeah, I warned you about that.
I still feel it. It's so itchy. Itchy...	You don't have a tail anymore.
Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! Whoops, wrong one.	You're Lisa's brother!
I'll take that... Too slow, Drooly Joe... Peek-a-boo! I steal from you!	Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! Whoops, wrong one.
Silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!	Sir, you wanna set the baby down? Don't worry, I just want to talk.
You're like all Easter Bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! Maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. Oh, hey Marge.	Tea? In the parlor?
Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?	This is my husband Homer.
We throw those out anyway.	Way to blow our tea, Marge. That's the last refrigerator magnet calendar you get from me!
"Hey, good looking. Wanna snuggle with ""Tyrannosaurus Sex""?"	You lie! Stop lying!
Oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. There's, uh... Lisa and...the stove.	No, I don't. I'm still upset about what happened today. I don't have many friends and when I finally start to make some, you ruin it!
Oh, that poor woman. I am gonna find her a friend! Someone cute, athletic, with a nice laugh.	Oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. There's, uh... Lisa and...the stove.
It's a risk I'll have to take.	My husband... and my best friend!
Son, I need to find a new friend for your mother. So you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself.	Because it's terrible for me. But I'll get back to you. Soon.
I wish. I made these at work.	We're on food stamps?
Hmmm. I bet she'd be a good friend for Marge. She looks defeated too!	I wish. I made these at work.
Psst. Psst!	Hmmm. I bet she'd be a good friend for Marge. She looks defeated too!
Hey Marge, where you goin'?	Psst. Psst!
Why does every woman I try to talk to run into cans?	Hey Marge, where you goin'?
Marge, I did it! I found a woman to be your new friend! She's waiting in the living room!	Arrivedérci, ignorance!
I bet you can't throw a cat over the house.	I'm going out for some air.
Marge... in a gang? What're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? Seriously, I would love that.	For your information, I am now a junior member of the Cheery Red Tomatoes.
"Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""Peterson's Field Guide to Birds"" on the kitchen counter?"	Oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
Roadrunners are real!	"Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""Peterson's Field Guide to Birds"" on the kitchen counter?"
"Now, let's see what Marge is up to. ""Recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""Heist plans""!"	Idioto! Idioto! Idioto!
Burns' Mansion?! That's Mr. Burns' mansion!	"Now, let's see what Marge is up to. ""Recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""Heist plans""!"
I gotta stop Marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.	It's all right.
Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! Game over, man! Game over! So, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?	I got the combination from Burns after I let him feel me up during the Depression. Zero to the right... zero to the left... back to zero.
I'm not!	Why... you're all women!
Oh, well... I try to have a good time.	I suppose, but you're certainly buxom and flirty.
And tell me I'm not fat.	Oh, no jury on earth will convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers. I'll tell you what, ladies, give me my eggs back and I'll let you go.
And Marge, there are certain things I can do for you that no other friend can. Special things.	Listen, Marge. No matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul.
BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP...	Now, hold perfectly still for seventy-eight minutes...
BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP... BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP...	BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP...
DO, DO, DO DO / DO, DOOO...	BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP... BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP...
Charge! I mean, yes sir?!	Simpson!
A Lamborgotti Fasterossa? That's the car I think about when I make love to my wife.	I just bought a new car. A nice foreign number... the Lamborgotti Fasterossa.
You're sending me to Italy?	Yes, I need you to pick up my car at the factory in Italy, and ship it directly back to me. I'll save thousands in taxes!
Can I take my family?!	Yes!
Do I have to hang out with them?	Sure.
What's in you?	Hey, that guy in first class is taking a TV out of his armrest.
A buncha stupid cables.	What's in you?
That flag is mine! Don't mess with Texas!	I think Dad may blow your cover.
Shock and Awe, losers! Shock and Awe!	That flag is mine! Don't mess with Texas!
Now we have to drive it straight to Rome, where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield.	Ooh, marriage!
Marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?	Gee, I wish we could explore a little more of Italy.
Why you little...	Why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
Wow! I've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here.	So, first time in Italy?
A McDonald's where you can get booze!	Wow! I've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here.
Eh, there's a picture of it on my cup.	Dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?
Savages.	When Mount Vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death.
Let me check the navigation system...	We've passed the Ponte Vecchio bridge three times. I think we're lost.
It says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.	Let me check the navigation system...
I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.	That's a DVD of a Fellini movie!
Don't worry. We got the cheese insurance.	Mozzarella! Parmigiano! Provolone! Pecorino! Gorgonzola! Fontina! Tallegio! Bocconcini!
Nooooo!	It doesn't cover mortadella.
Stupid Italy... wish you'd never been unified by Victor Emmanuel the Second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring.	Nooooo!
Hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?	Maybe there's a mechanic in this Tuscan village.
It's a Lamborgotti Fasterosa XT 550 with ABS Sport Tech package.	Scusi?
Americano? What the Hell could that mean? Why can't you people learn to speak my language? I learned to eat your food!	Ehhh... Americano?
I honor you and your country.	Hey, she says the mayor speaks English.
Yes, tell us your story. But it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you'd better make us root for the protagonist.	How did you wind up here?
Okay, so far I'm rootin' for ya.	My tale begins after I had once again attempted to murder Bart...
Holy moley!	This is my bride, Francesca, and my son, Gino.
"I always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud."""	Holy moley!
Yeah, I never went to college.	Well... I experimented in college, as one does.
Yeah, I tell Marge everything! Not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such.	Bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?
All right, Bob. We won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car.	And literature is filled with tales of redemption, from Jean Valjean to the voice of Buzz Lightyear, Tim Allen.
I thought I was doing Donald Trump.	Dad, don't act like Mussolini!
Prego?	Here's a cute fact. This sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
I love you, Marge.	Prego?
It's called a hangover, sweetie. And it's an unavoidable part of life.	I feel so sick.
Mr. Burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties.	Where is my roadster? You were due back a month ago!
What am I supposed to use it for -- transporting water to distant urban centers?!	Dad, you're driving on an ancient Roman aqueduct!
Uh-oh.	What am I supposed to use it for -- transporting water to distant urban centers?!
Lazy Romans.	Uh-oh.
Opera? They have that here too?	Hey, Krusty's in an opera, here in Rome! He can save our lives! Come on, let's go!
Can I be the Phantom of the Opera?	Tell ya what, put on these costumes, go on the stage and mix in with the crowd scenes. He won't kill ya in front of all those witnesses.
But I do a great impression of him.	Dad, the Phantom isn't in this.
I am the gayest super-villain ever! Beware my scented candles! Oooooo, scented!	But I do a great impression of him.
I know, and he's magic!	That's Sideshow Bob!
Hey, knock it off.	WHEN A WIFE LOOKS LIKE THAT / AND HER HUSBAND'S SO FAT, THAT'S AMORE! / WHEN SHE KISSES THAT JERK / WHILE I DO ALL THE WORK / THAT'S A...
Maybe he's cheating on us with the Episcopalians.	Where's Reverend Lovejoy? He's never been late for Christmas service.
Look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky Eucharist. I wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font.	Maybe he's cheating on us with the Episcopalians.
Did anyone order a hero?	Now there's no one to deliver the sermon!
Okay, Christmas, Christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a Christmas card with his home address on it? What's up with that?	Did anyone order a hero?
No tip till they bring back Hagar the Horrible!	I wanted you to tip me!
"Oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... I'd like to tell you all a little story I call ""The First Christmas."""	That's not my decision!
A carpenter named Joseph was about to get some frankly preposterous news...	I, for one, am dying to hear it!
And did you know that little Baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?	A Christmas tree? What a great name! Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.
I know, it's weird, isn't it?	Ohhh...!
My God... it's over... We're free!	/ No poko-miku for Cyrus!
I said we're free!	It's not over, it's just intermission!
I hope I never hear that God-awful nutcracker music again.	Boo! This is terrible!
I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY	'CAUSE CHRISTMAS EVE IS HERE! Oy!
That's great! Now I'll just get my present for you. Which is... right outside the door.	Merry Christmas, Homie. I think you're really gonna like this.
Oh my God, I forgot to get Marge a present!	That's great! Now I'll just get my present for you. Which is... right outside the door.
I NEED A PRESENT FOR MY WIFE / OR I'LL HAVE NO SEX FOR LIFE / DIAMOND RING, A VASE BY MING / SOME KINDA USEFUL KITCHEN THING	Oh my God, I forgot to get Marge a present!
I NEED A STORE I CAN BREAK INTO	I NEED A PRESENT FOR MY WIFE / OR I'LL HAVE NO SEX FOR LIFE / DIAMOND RING, A VASE BY MING / SOME KINDA USEFUL KITCHEN THING
OR A PLACE RUN BY A HINDU!	I NEED A STORE I CAN BREAK INTO
Oh, it's just what I wanted. Here, Marge, this is for you.	I knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me.
I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...	So tell us, what's next for William H. Macy?
Lifeguard, huh?	I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.	Homie, what's wrong? Did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?
"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!"	The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
Mason Fairbanks...	"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!"
His hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!	Mason Fairbanks...
Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. Oh, that sounds hard. Just do it!	His hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!
Uh yes, I'm a reporter with the local paper. I'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?	Can I help you?
Interesting. Interesting.	I'd be delighted. But I must warn you, I don't wear a sweater every day.
So, I infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake.	Interesting. Interesting.
Oh, that is so cool! Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!	No, actually I salvage valuables from sunken ships. Some call me a treasure hunter.
So, you don't have any shrunken heads?	Those are raisins.
Uh... you know it's a boat, right?	And this is the lady in my life.
I'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.	Indeed I do. I loved a real woman a long time ago but uh... it didn't work out.
No... I said I work for a radio station. Nine-eighty on the AM dial but number one with our viewers!	Listeners? I thought you worked for a newspaper.
Uh... well I... I think you're my pappy!	Viewers? Wouldn't that be for a TV station?
I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson.	Wha...?
Possible Daddy!	Dear God. I always dreamed this day would come. And now that it's here, there are so many feelings... I -- I...
I'm sorry... I got a little carried away there.	Possible Daddy!
Hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on Daddy's boat!	Homie, you just met this British man. It's too soon to get so emotionally invested.
Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?	And now that treasure is somewhere down there.
Mason, come see my room!	I was busy telling young people to get a haircut.
Woo hoo!	This guy.
And my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.	Today I'm filled with joy: searching for treasure with my long-lost son. My dream for each of you is that you find the happiness I feel today.
Ha-ha! That's what you get for being luminous, jerks!	These waters contain some of Mother Nature's most stunning creatures.
Hey guys, we found the treasure! When I get to shore, I'm bringin' it right to the bar.	Homer, look! The treasure of Piso Mojado!
Oh, which way did Mason go? That must be him over there.	How do I talk? Push this button here? You're all losers!
I drew this picture of you.	What the... hey...
That is so sweet.	It may not be much, but it's all I've got.
Dad...	I gave you everything and it still wasn't enough.
Wait. Can we have a moment in private?	Well Homer, now that you're alive again, I'll leave you with your real family.
As I lay dying on the ocean floor, I remembered everything you've done for me. To Hell with that stupid DNA test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and I love you.	Of course.
But how?	And now there's something I've gotta tell you: I really am your father.
Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.	My old one's fine, but ya never know.
Aw, Dad.	Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
Send up two hams!	It would be my pleasure... son.
Hey, this one's cold!	Send up two hams!
Listen... I wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.	No water fountain outwits Willie!
Teach me that the stove is hot.	Anything, son.
But I'm not tired!	All right, nap time.
Hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. It's the perfect thing to straighten you out.	"It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out. They use a proven concept, ""tough hate"", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. Then they send them home, quietly ticking away."
Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!	Hey, check it out -- I made it partially risqué.
Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system.	Dad, if you take me to Vegas, I'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack.
I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.	What's your system?
One child to Portland! He's your problem now.	I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.
Why, there must be some mistake.	It seems he was our problem before. Your son's on the no-fly list.
Oh yeah?! You're going to that camp, 'cause I'm gonna drive you there.	Well Homer, looks like I can't go to discipline camp. Which is too bad, 'cause I think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out.
Stupid Bart... makes me drive to Oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of Matt Groening ...	And Nelson saw somethin' funny.
You mean Fun Homer? I'm afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.	Dad, neither of us wanna go. Why are you doing this? Where's the old carefree Homer who likes to cut loose?
It's no use.	Fight back, fun Homer! Together we can win!
Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act.	C'mon, Dad, we got a long way to go. You can't stay mad at me the whole time.
At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie.	Well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing I'm good at.
So, I see you're also traveling with your son. What boy prison are you taking him to?	At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie.
See Bart, I told you things could be worse.	Actually, Justin and I are going to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Sir Peter Hall himself is directing.
Look at me, I use a napkin.	Did you see that? They were eating melon for breakfast!
I bet they're from Massachusetts. You know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son.	Well Dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame.
Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare.	Well, I guess it's tinkle time.
Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special.	So, here for a snack before they roll you back into the ocean?
Uh, but could you add a bacon nose? Plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body.	Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special.
Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!	I'm kidding.
You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?	No he doesn't!
You little monster! Show your face this minute!	You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?
Bart, where are you?!	You little monster! Show your face this minute!
Why you little...	What?! No one dashie-dine on Stavros!
I'm stuck!	Why you little...
Ow! Someone's hitting my butt with something!	I'm stuck!
So Lenny, how's it goin' in Vegas? Pretty boring, I'll bet.	Leave your ass, Homer. Leave your ass.
Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.	Hm, if I save you, what are you gonna do to me?
I'll kill you! I'll kill your whole family!	Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
Kidding! I'm kidding! We can do that, we have a special friendship.	I'll kill you! I'll kill your whole family!
I'm gonna double kill you! And then I'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. Then I'll dig you up and kill you again! That's the beauty of a shallow grave.	Kidding! I'm kidding! We can do that, we have a special friendship.
You sweet little angel. Oh, I'm gonna rip your head off. And spit down your adorable little neck. Because I wanna smash your little stupid head. Oh, but I love you we'll go on a fishing trip. But first I'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. That's what I'm gonna do!	I'm gonna double kill you! And then I'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. Then I'll dig you up and kill you again! That's the beauty of a shallow grave.
Well boy, you made the right choice. I think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us.	If you have to explain it, it's not good, Chief.
"I don't enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"	Dad, I think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer.
Hey, I enjoy you plenty.	Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, I wouldn't be so screwed up.
Talking time is over.	Hey, I enjoy you plenty.
Thank you, Colonel.	"Don't worry, Mr. Simpson. We're gonna take his ""sass"" and turn it into ""siss."""
Woo hoo! Vegas here I come!	Now kiss your childhood goodbye.
I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!	Don't gamble on my love, Homer!
I'm comin', boy!	I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!
I bet this looks cool from overhead though.	I'm comin', boy!
Woo hoo! Vegas here I come! Oh right, Bart.	I bet this looks cool from overhead though.
Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!	I've learned so much in my three hours here. I don't have to play pranks to feel good. I can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!	Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!
Son, I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!	Dad?
And don't you try to stop us.	I'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
Uh, normal wear and tear.	And don't you try to stop us.
Try this one...	Actually, we were gonna call you, Mr. Simpson. Your credit card was declined.
"Uh, Marge. Me and Bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in Nevada State Prison. Also, I don't know where Bart is. If you see him, say ""hey."""	Homer, I hope you get this. I'm in jail and I need ten thousand dollars bail. Hurry!
Marge, I ripped my pants! The only pants that understand my complex hiney.	Well, tell your regular bully. He won't like it one bit.
I paid for fifty laps and I'm gonna take them!	Sir, your go-cart's damaged.
OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE?	DINING ON UNTAINTED MEAT / A TOILET WHAT STILL HAS ITS SEAT /
Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if I whipped up public interest for them?	Big blue pants. When you no longer care if you're attractive to women.
Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, I haven't even thought of it yet.	Of course, but how?
How long is this commercial anyway?	Well, what have I got to lose, besides the factory that's been in my family for generations?
Huh?	Homie, what's that?
"It's called ""headvertising."" It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."	On the back of your head.
It's not supposed to.	Wow, it glows in the dark.
BLUE PANTS! BLUE PANTS!	AND WHERE SHOULD IT NOT GO?
Fine.	Dad, get your own song.
I'M GETTING BLUE PANTS IN THE MORNING / DING DONG THE ZIPPER'S GONNA SHINE...	Fine.
Well, it did its job. Everyone's wearing blue pants now.	I'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
Earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. Except the Maine potatoes one. It's just a reminder to myself.	What are those doing there?
Silly Indians. Our God made their god.	"""Local Anahoopi Indians believed this stalactite was the finger of Tsisnajini, their God of pointing down."""
I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.	It's so impressive.
I'm stuck! And I have to pee. Now I'm just stuck.	Save me, Tsisnajini!
Why you little...!	That was two firemen, a crane and Snow White.
Don't leave me! I hate to be alone! Except when I'm watching TV, then leave me alone. But right now, don't leave!	Well, we better start looking.
Will you tell me a story?	I'll stay with you, Dad.
No unicorns.	Sure. Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom--
Wait, wait, wait, wait...	One day, while I was savoring the exclusivity--
Now you're telling me Burns's story?	Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Huh?	"Yeah -- it's like the play within a play in ""Hamlet."""
Gotcha.	Let's see... It's like when you watch old home movies of you watching TV.
I'm bald!	Scavengers... scavenge!
Hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. Like this!	Hey bar-boy, write a play where I meet Henry Ford and Captain Kirk.
I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!	Hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. Like this!
"Sure! You're gonna be all ""I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!"""	I'm a little busy. Can I do it later?
Moe has a cappuccino machine??!!	Treasure?!
Hey Moe! Thanks to you, I've been sober a week!	Aw geez.
You didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.	Oh, you poor man. You're about to get a lot poorer.
Well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!	Aw Dad, did my story make you cry?
Oh, why did I lead you down here to find those stupid coins?	Well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!
Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding.	That was the most horrible part of all!
I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.	OH THE YELLOW GOLD OF TEXAS / IS WHAT I WANNA SAVE / I WILL NOT PAY NO TAXES / IF I HIDE IT IN A CAVE
I figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. Money which we could use to pay for Bart's operation.	I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
That's a story for another day.	I need an operation?
I realized I could never find the gold without your help. So I made it this week's family outing.	That's a story for another day.
It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?	Why does God always need money?
'Cause he wants it.	How can you be sure?
"Now to begin ""Operation: Slight Edge""."	On your marks, get set Wait, someone's not on their mark. That's better... Go!
I'm winning!	"Now to begin ""Operation: Slight Edge""."
He's headed for the old mill. No, Cheatie, no!	I'm winning!
Protect the duck! Protect the duck! Produck the tect!	So many paddles.
Hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!	Protect the duck! Protect the duck! Produck the tect!
A living duck! I wished too hard and he became real!	And the winner is--
Hey... that's the same thing you said to Bart after he choked in that soccer game. And we both know he sucked.	There, there... the fact that you tried means everything.
Just put it in the trunk and leave.	Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl.
A canoe made of country ham? You know I'll eat it.	Let's do it again!
I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.	¡Ay, el Mundo es loco!
So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you.	Homer! We're not in high school.
Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.	Maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
Old Man Flanders!	"Well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the S.A.T.: ""Snuggles And Tickles."""
Springfield High football rules!	Hey Homer! Sneakin' kisses from the Missus?
No one turn on the sprinklers, okay?	Springfield High football rules!
Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.	Dad, Mom's over at the Flanders', babysitting Nimrod and Nimtodd. We wanna do something.
I am gonna get them so wet.	Uh... sure.
Sad? You're crazy. I feel like I'm at the Oscars for the animals I forgot existed.	This is much sadder than I expected.
My son's been ape-napped!	Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream.
Aren't you gonna do something?	Help! She's grooming me! She's grooming me!
But she'll leave the rest of him alone?	I'm afraid there's nothing we can do now. A chimp that size could tear your son's head right off.
Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen.	Where's Bart? I haven't seen him since you came home.
I know what you think: when stupid Homer wasn't looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey.	I didn't say that.
And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later I can say that I already told you.	I could never think something that horrible.
Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!	Dad, you can't keep this up for long.
Bart! Bart!	Whoa! This Oreo is rank.
When the monkey falls asleep, I'll sneak you out in this trash bag. Then I'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze.	Bart! Bart!
I fell asleep before the monkey.	Whee. Whee.
Uh-oh.	I fell asleep before the monkey.
Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel.	Maybe there's another way to solve this. Bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for Toot-Toot.
Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!	While you were living the glamorous life of a TV chimp, I was raising my son. You have no right to take him away from me now. Please, please, give me back my boy.
Mr. Teeny?!	Hey, I know how we can save Bart.
Why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? I like your hat, sweetie.	Maybe he's getting married!
I mean the one at the house.	I'm not wearing a hat!
Oh my God!	Eh, I gotta work tomorrow. I-I'd better go.
How did Lenny get to be Newsfake Magazine's Man of the Year?	"""Mother-Flippers?"" What's this show about?"
What?! Next you'll be telling me he didn't meet Woody Woodpecker!	That's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
Lenny, this TV is amazing. If you're not careful, I might just spend the rest of my life on your couch.	I've never seen a picture so highly defined!
You're right, Lenny. I...	You don't mean that literally, of course.
Lenny! Bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! Chop-chop!	You're right, Lenny. I...
Look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.	Lenny! Bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! Chop-chop!
"Ooo, ""Two and a Half Men!"" You can see the soulless emptiness in Charlie Sheen's eyes."	Look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.
Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk up to the TV and I'll show you how thin it is.	Mom didn't say anything about high-def!
Oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore.	Wow, there's a rainbow outside.
Wow, I can actually feel the heat.	The winner is, Bodell Jenks Junior!
Can you at least take a picture of me with the TV?	Beat it! This is my alone time!
Oh yeah, good times.	I ain't fallin' for that again.
Stupid non-plasma TV. Picture so blurry. Might as well rub dirt in my eyes.	Oh yeah, good times.
Oh Marge! I love you! I love you! I love you!	Homie, I've been thinking. We have been using this TV for a long time. So I entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen TV.
There's a chance we won't win?	Now I really hope we win that contest.
My collection is complete. Forty years of the Family Circus.	There's a chance we won't win?
The big screen TV?	Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You've won!
All expenses paid?	No. No one wins that. You won third prize: a tour of the Fox Network in Los Angeles, California.
Hey, funny man, say something funny!	Ooh, why look, there's Dan Castellaneta from the Tracey Ullman show.
Don't lean out of the tra--	Please don't lean out of the tram, sir, you might get hurt.
That's just the product I've been coveting! Pick us! Pick us!	Oh, about enough to buy a new plasma TV.
Are you kidding? Take a look at my DVD.	Not so fast. Are you sure you want your most intimate moments broadcast across the country?
They'll never let me near Lake Havasu again.	Are you kidding? Take a look at my DVD.
I'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.	What are you doing, Homer?
Oh Marge, you're the greatest mom ever. I want the whole world to see that.	Well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives.
Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?	I got my tenure at twenty-eight.
Yeah, well I have full tenure.	I got my tenure right here.
I'll bet the twist is he's gay.	You can call me Charlie. But do not call me late when there are scones about. Little British humor.
Because we'll be on TV, and earn enough money to buy a TV. TV.	I don't understand, Dad. Our family has so many flaws. Why must we share them with the world?
Yes, TV-sa?	But Dad...
Listen up, Stonehenge. I made a drawing of the places on Marge you can't touch. Especially the hair.	Forget it.
You take forever to say nothing.	Oh, you needn't worry. I'm a bit of an elbow man, myself, actually. A bit different, a bit weird. Not sexual.
Ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on Fox. Why'd you do it?	You take forever to say nothing.
I see. Well, I should be getting to the living room...	Well, I thought there was no further way I could humiliate my husband. And then this opportunity came along.
Well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either.	You know, I despise my husband.
Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football.	Charles hasn't satisfied me in years.
I don't know why I ever married that woman.	Cruel, dusty years!
Uh, okay.	"Now Homer, would you care to give your report on ""C.S.I. Miami?"""
There's this guy that got killed -- I think it was in Miami? So C.S.I. Miami investiga-ted-ed it. Then a family said how much they loved the Olive Garden. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias.	Uh, okay.
What's that delicious smell?	And there we have it.
She's nowhere to be seen. Time to let Homer be Homer.	I don't think you do. Spot on.
Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!	Homie, I missed you so much! Put your pants back on.
Maggie? She's in her crib.	"Where is she? Where is the soul-sucking she-beast I call ""Sweetums?"""
So it would appear. However, Cousin It, there, was born a woman.	You're leaving me for him?!
"Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote ""No"" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt."	What brought us together is how much we hate you.
Kidding! Kidding! I don't vote! The polling place is up a hill and I never make it!	"Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote ""No"" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH / YOU MAKE ME CRY / WITHOUT YOU I'D JUST / WANT TO DIE / FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE / YOU'LL BE A FIXTURE / NOW LET ME ENJOY / YOUR PICTURE IN PICTURE...	Kidding! Kidding! I don't vote! The polling place is up a hill and I never make it!
And Marge, you're pretty great too.	YOU MAKE ME LAUGH / YOU MAKE ME CRY / WITHOUT YOU I'D JUST / WANT TO DIE / FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE / YOU'LL BE A FIXTURE / NOW LET ME ENJOY / YOUR PICTURE IN PICTURE...
I thought it was about her boobs.	About a class of remedial reading students and their teacher who wants to be taken seriously.
Tonight on Jock Center: a slugger on 'roids, Tiger Woods is annoyed, and North Korean missiles deployed!	I thought it was about her boobs.
I've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. I, Homer Simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to Springfield.	Haw--
I'll show you all. I'm gonna spearhead the hell out of this expansion bid!	And that's not your strong suit, big guy.
Marge, meet pro football's newest team: the Springfield Meltdowns!	Homie, you've been down here for a week, I really think you need- What the Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise?!
Plus I designed a state-of-the-art stadium. We'll fund it with corporate naming rights. It's the Duff Beer-Krustyburger-Buzz Cola-Costington's Department Store-Kwik-E-Mart-Stupid Flanders Park!	Marge, meet pro football's newest team: the Springfield Meltdowns!
So... Homer do good?	Plus I designed a state-of-the-art stadium. We'll fund it with corporate naming rights. It's the Duff Beer-Krustyburger-Buzz Cola-Costington's Department Store-Kwik-E-Mart-Stupid Flanders Park!
Maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.	It's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
You mean...	I am never coming back to this city -- and neither is the league!
You're a useless old man! Name one thing you do for this family.	That's right! The Springfield Meltdowns football club shall never be!
Yeah, you're right.	Homie, you should give your Dad a call. You can't stay mad at him forever.
"Y'ello. You want my opinion on current movies?! Well, first of all, they're all perfect. Also: when's the Cap'n Crunch movie coming out? And will it be ""R"" or ""Hard R""?"	Yeah, you're right.
Lisa's right! It is a cool, super sport!	No! Wait! Wait! Bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!
Ooh, a penny. This is my lucky day.	Hell, yeah!
Hurry up and kill it! I have to be at the opera by seven!	Distracted as if by a moral dilemma. A moral dilemma posed by a young boy... no, a girl! A girl named Linda... no, Lisa! The flutter of the cape tells all.
Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie!	Before we begin the movie, please join me in a moment of silence for the workers who gave their lives in an heroic --
Woo hoo! I win! In your face, best friends!	However, federal law requires I keep one union worker on the payroll. So congratulations, whoever catches this bouquet.
Hey, Marge it's what I've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury.	You've been transferred to India!?
Oh my God, you're right! I'd better call the guy.	Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.
Send someone right over! Ooh, here he is.	Oh my God, you're right! I'd better call the guy.
Yeah, well while I'm gone, you'll do what he says.	Send someone right over! Ooh, here he is.
What about her.	Whoa! He's gone!
I'll miss you kids too.	Aw Dad, we'll miss you so much.
That's me!	Attention: India Air Flight fifty-seven. Now boarding first class, small children and fat guys.
Woo hoo!	Homie, I got you something to read on the plane.
A book?	Woo hoo!
Oh, the cereal's just a metaphor.	A book?
Thanks, sweetie. I've never been less angry to receive a book.	"It's a book about management, and Lee Iacocca says it's ""definitely, dot dot dot useful."""
Oh no! I took a job on the other side of the world!	Delighted.
Oh, I hate this sub-continent.	Oh no! I took a job on the other side of the world!
Lisa! It's me! I'm in trouble!	Hello?
A cow took my iPod and I punched it!	Calm down, Dad. What happened?
Uh-huh... Do I have to? Okay, okay, I'll show the cow I adore it.	A cow took my iPod and I punched it!
Oh baby... ooo, did you lose weight?... oh c'mon, baby, don't play hard to milk...	Uh-huh... Do I have to? Okay, okay, I'll show the cow I adore it.
Let's see... Apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair...	Okay, Apu said his cousin Kavi could help me out.
Are you Kavi?	Let's see... Apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair...
Are you Kavi?	No.
Finally.	Yes, oh, you must be Mr. Homer!
Hindu. What do you call the moisture on your Hin?	Sorry I'm late. I was doing Carnak with my bodyguard.
"Uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... Did I say ""um""?"	Classic. Now, tell them how to run a nuclear plant!
Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.	Dad, I've gotta write a report on the Great Lakes.
Outsourcing!	I think he's in the house!
Well, a little book once told me...	Simpson, I don't know how you're doing it, but you're outputting ten times the power our American plant ever did.
...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.	Well, a little book once told me...
You're giving me absolute power?!	I see what you're saying. We're crowding your plate. In fact, there's no need for us to be here at all. Let's go, Smithers.
I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.	Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a dinner engagement. I don't want my scooped-out monkey head to get cold.
Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof.	Actually, in our system of belief, there are many gods.
I won a free soda! I am a god!	Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof.
I am a God! I know all!	We thought maybe you would like to see some of our globetrotting adventures.
Silence! Now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant.	A-bom-shabai! A-bom-shabai! A-bom-shabai! A-bom-shabai!
Marge?	Homie, stop! You're not a God!
It's... um... Jannnn... Febbbb... Marrr...	Oh yeah? What's Mom's birthday?
May firrr... seconnn... thirrr...	It's May!
Well, I'm just glad I'm not a god anymore. I wanna go home. How's Chief Wiggum?	I'm proud of you, Dad. You're the first man to ever outsource the American worker's sense of entitlement and privilege.
Yeah, he's funny.	He was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
I'm so bored, I figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats.	When is our food gonna get here? I'm starved.
See, it goes: ship's wheel, Popeye tattoo, Gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel.	I'm so bored, I figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats.
My life's work ruined.	What about this swordfish?
Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!	Finally, we shall bid goodbye to England and its drunken, decadent sinners.
Hide me!	Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!
Please, you've gotta help me! If they find me they'll kill me.	Hide me!
Oh Lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me.	Mother, we must protect him. Look, he's praying.
So, thou art a widow, eh?! Then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee.	And I will make thee a hat from construction paper!
Oh baby...	Good sir, I do not approve of your fleshly gaze.
What kind of a booze cruise is this? Where's the hooch?	Don't come back!
Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss...	I see you met our devout leader, Ned Flandish.
She's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.	Now I gotta warn ya, even for this day and age, I'm considered a bad husband.
Why thee little...	Well, I'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying.
May I escort you to the railing?	Perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
Beer? I thought you guys didn't drink on the Gayflower.	Anyways, I just wanted to let you know, that I'm throwin' a little party tonight to celebrate that only half of us have died so far.
What-ever.	Stop callin' it that!
But baby, a man has needs.	Homer, I can't believe I was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!
People, this is madness! We can burn the witch later! Right now, I've got to save this ship!	Witch! Witch! Witch!
Hey, I've been driving drunk since I was twelve! But first...who's gonna help me pee?	People, this is madness! We can burn the witch later! Right now, I've got to save this ship!
Don't worry, Marge. I'll see to it you fundamentalist Christians live to take over all America by the twenty-first century!	They're looking at me 'cause I have the key to the stocks.
Man, that bird did it all. Good guy.	An albatross! It can lead us to safety.
Land ho!	At least I'm pitching!
I do!	Who else has a story?
"Well, I guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. It takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: ""the nineteen seventies."""	I'll be fetchin' yer food right away. Six more games.
My wig! I mean, my natural hair!	I love the sea, Smithers. No earthquakes, towering infernos, China syndromes, apple dumpling gangs...
I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.	Goin' out with a sight gag. Nice.
Nooooo!	I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
Catch me, Flanders!	Nooooo!
...three... two... one... Happy New Year! My resolution is to be more fun!	Homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!
Uh, gimme a second, I'm in the bathroom.	Homer, what should we do?
What? I have great ass suction. Now how 'bout a little privacy?	Uh, gimme a second, I'm in the bathroom.
My keys!	What? I have great ass suction. Now how 'bout a little privacy?
Swim, fatty, swim!	All right, I can see this is all up to me.
Don't tell me what to do.	I've tied it off. You're all going to make it. Tell the world... that I saved you all.
Oh my God, our boat is upside down!	I don't know which pains me more, the flame or the irony! Can you believe it's the irony?
Or will ever do.	Dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us.
"Hey, it says here ""the book"" was written by Tom Stoppard. This isn't a book, it's a play! Book."	I can't wait to see this re-imagining of Itchy and Scratchy... by avant-garde director Juliana Krellner!
Hey, check it out, I'm Scratcher or something.	AND DYNAMITE IGNITING!
They're gonna divide the school in two?	Now this is why I got into education.
Well, you know what a man invented? Actual paper.	Why, a woman invented liquid paper.
Which goes great with another male invention -- the car.	Well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper.
Let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles...	Um... I-I think a woman came up with nylon stockings. I mean, probably. We certainly use them.
Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?	Mom, I don't think this will fool anybody.
You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?	He's one of Bart's friends.
Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.	You never take our kids to the movies.
"So... do you wanna ""wang chung"" tonight?"	I am looking, and don't start a puke war that you cannot finish. Goodnight.
Well, uh... uh... Honey, you're just as smart as a man. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like I'm doing it with a dude.	I don't know. I'm still frowny with you. Do you really think women are mentally inferior?
At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you.	Well, I won't be lonely. I can always cuddle with the dog.
How did this happen?	At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you.
Screw you! I'm never gonna pay!	Please! Somebody take 'em!
Fine! I'll finish it myself. And don't think I'm gonna screw it up, because I won't!	Well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short.
But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them.	Dad, all you had to do was paint one number. Now no one's gonna be able to find our house.
My work here is done.	"Hey Sal Bando, give him a '74 A's ""thank you honk."""
I'm needed at the door!	My work here is done.
Seventy-four? Oh sorry, there's been a mistake.	I have a delivery for a Scott and Brenda Weingarten, Seventy-four Evergreen Terrace.
On second thought, I am Brenda Wine cooler.	Oh, no problem -- I'll just ship these juicy mail-order steaks back to Omaha.
Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly. Now, for once, I'm getting' rich-person mail. You wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?	Dad, isn't it wrong to open or eat other people's mail?
Okay Weingartens, what else is in your mail?	Oh Dad, no one can rationalize like you.
Ooh! Marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?	Okay Weingartens, what else is in your mail?
"Mark and Tracy, I remember the first words I heard you say: ""I do."""	Strangers getting married?! I wouldn't miss it for the world!
Take that, liberal media.	I'm scared, people. Truly scared.
Marge, I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail.	"""A highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax."" But how could I have won? I don't subscribe to this periodical."
She's opening her eyes!	Et tu, Zud?
You monster! What have you done to my face?!	She doesn't recognize us!
When will Marge remember us?	You monster! What have you done to my face?!
Jogging?!	It's hard to say. With retrograde amnesia such as this, the patient can forget years and years of her life. You just have to keep jogging her memory till it works.
Sweet!	I didn't say you should be jogging.
Jogging?	Although you should be jogging.
Marge, I'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. I got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room.	Jogging?
I'm your husband!	Oh, you're sweet. I'm lucky to have such a kind... Uncle?
I am! We're the same age!	Wha--?!
I do eat a lot of crap.	But you're so much more... ravaged than I am.
Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home.	I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot.
Why you little...	Oh it's great. Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?	You strangle your child?
Why you little...	It hurts when I swallow.
"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."	Who are those freaks?
See that ball of fire? That's the sun. It goes by many names: Apollo's Lantern, Day-moon, Old Blazey. The important thing is never to touch it.	Whoa, I may be wasted, but I still care about the safety of these kids.
Yes, now you do.	I know what the sun is.
I'd better get ready -- I'm next!	It's so great to have my children back.
All right, Marge... time to remember Admiral Awesome!	I'd better get ready -- I'm next!
Why do you remember them and not me?	Nope. I'm sorry, Admiral, but you're still a stranger to me.
Here's me fighting with former President Bush, me fighting with current President Bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss.	Okay. All it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.
Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose.	I'm sorry. You seem like... a colorful character, but I just don't remember you.
When a man and a woman love each other very much, they--	What's snuggling?
But what if we...	Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you -- I'm not making love with you!
You used to love my non sequiturs!	You're describing how to parallel park.
Oh no, Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!	We've got to tell Dad!
Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again.	Mr. Simpson?
The heart is the symbol for love.	Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again.
So beautiful. I wish I could understand Italian.	THAT HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S QUITE A GUY / HE PAID ME TEN BUCKS / SO I WOULD LIE / THE TRUTH IS / HE'S NOT SO GREAT / HE IS THE ONE MAN / I TRU-LY HATE...
Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!	I've had a lovely evening, Mr. Simpson.
It was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know...	Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
Oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.	No! I'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?	That sounds horrible!
I know. Wait, I thought of another way: I stay!	I'm sorry you have to leave. But I just can't think of another way.
Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your boo!	Look at this garden of F's. You planted them all!
I know. I just thought maybe... boo!	That works for hiccups, not amnesia.
Well, the rest of your life for sure.	How long you gonna be bunking with me, son?
That might be Marge!	Go suck a rat, Assanova.
Marge?	Don't answer it yet -- savor the sound.
I sure have, pardner.	I just think the best thing a person can do for the world is to be clean and polite.
Oh no! He's Marge's, and my, dream man! I've gotta make a play for her now or I might lose her forever!	I sure have, pardner.
At least she's found someone who can make her happy.	Oh no! He's Marge's, and my, dream man! I've gotta make a play for her now or I might lose her forever!
You idiot!	"Wow, my first thought is ""respect"" -- both for your mental illness and your ability to get back into shape. My second thought is goodbye!"
The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet.	Who the hell are you?
You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off.	Go on.
Really? Well she's still great!	Dude, she's got three kids.
I'm so happy we're together again. Wanna get a drink?	I still don't remember you, but for the first time since this happened, I wish I did... Homer.
"Uh, yeah. I started when you were in the hospital. I was so worried. Recently I tried this thing called ""beer."" And..."	You drink?
But do you also remember that you're an enabler?	I remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
And her?	Oh, I don't...
And her.	Oh, and her.
What about him?	Uh-huh. And him.
Yeah, I have their baseball cards.	I don't recognize that name.
Look at all those people. You know them?	Oh, I know all them!
Yeah, she's over in post now.	Wow, she still works here?
Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai.	Oh, I always liked that guy!
Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!	Oh, and there's a familiar name. And another one. Wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? Did he get married?
When you get to third base, I'll buy ya a beer.	I just had my first kiss.
All right. Just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.	Homer, you're my father, you're supposed to protect me from things like this!
Woo-hoo! Weapons!	Sorry, loom-wads, new exhibit's in town.
Don't start the exhibit without me!	Die, weapons, die!
Time to do what I do best -- ruin it for everybody.	Look at that line.
Hey, Flanders! Thanks for saving our place.	Time to do what I do best -- ruin it for everybody.
Aw dude, I was totally here. You calling me a liar? In front of my kids? 'Cause I'd take a bullet for you, man. Right in my mouth!	Wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there Homer...
Oh, no you don't!	Yaaay!
I'm everywhere.	Oh, no you don't!
Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!	The nunchuck was invented thousands of years ago by a Chinese monk. Artifacts of the time indicate that this incident was hilarious.
Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith.	You're leavin' already? We, we haven't even gotten in yet.
Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.	So, according to creationism, there were no cavemen.
My mind is always open to new ideas.	Dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?
Onions in the peas! What the hell?	My mind is always open to new ideas.
This is the break in the case we've been waiting for!	Why, I believe right now this gentleman's havin' dinner with the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny.
Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...	Now, Bambi, who started that forest fire that killed your mama? Evolution? My, my, my.
I love it when you're not into it. Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah that's it ignore me. I'm not even here.	Homer, please.
Thanks, Marge. It's not a twist-off!	Look, Homie, I brought you a beer.
C'mon...	Thanks, Marge. It's not a twist-off!
C'mon! Open! I want what's in you!	As sure as I am that Jesus hates Hip Hop!
You, stupid...	As a matter... Homer...
Oh wait, it was a twist-off.	This court hereby rules that the law forbidding the teaching of evolution is repealed.
Now you can only see butts on cable.	That was two seasons ago!
The Isotopes are winning? To the bandwagon!	Thanks to him, Springfield is once again overrun with fair-weather fans.
Nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.	The Isotopes are winning? To the bandwagon!
Tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?	Nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.
Don't worry, I'll use the money I make to buy tickets from a scalper. Then I'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! Rich! We did it, baby! We made it through the rain!	Homer, we need those tickets to get in!
Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game...	Don't worry, I'll use the money I make to buy tickets from a scalper. Then I'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! Rich! We did it, baby! We made it through the rain!
Cop! Act like you're in love with me.	Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game...
Bart! Hand me that sack of batteries!	I concur!
Nine Volt! Double A! D!-D!-D!-D! Cordless drill!	Bart! Hand me that sack of batteries!
Look at that ugly old man.	Homer? Homer? Now we have to kiss. The big TV is telling us to!
Really? You'd kiss an ugly old man like me?	Give me a kiss, Homie.
"What a game! I got on the kiss-cam, I participated in ""the wave,"" and I got to pee in a trough! Marge, can we get a trough?"	I heard Jill died. Kelly, I think, is a prostitute.
Ooh, iced tea!	For the last time, no!
Buck Mitchell!	Hey, that was my iced tea. I just sweetened it to my liking!
Yes, yes. The game you played so horribly at.	Evenin', Ma'am. I uh... couldn't help seein' you two exchanging marital kisses tonight.
Season tickets?! I could entertain business clients. I might even land the Henderson account!	I was wonderin' if you and the mister could give us some marriage counseling. Ya know uh, in return, I can give you season tickets.
Sure. That means she wants to talk in private. It's probably about you.	Homer, can I see you in the kitchen?
Hey, we've gone through more hardships than the Jews and Charlie Brown put together.	Homie, I don't think our marriage is so Jim Dandy that we should be counseling others.
That's just how I feel.	Well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life.
Buck Mitchell!	That's what I want -- carefree intimacy, with no edge of resentment!
Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.	Buck, Tabitha, welcome. We'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as Homer gets here.
Now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till I say so.	Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.
Wow, I think we've really hit on something here. Unfortunately, we're out of time. How does that make you feel?	Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy you know, and when we got hitched, I just assumed she'd give up her international recording career to focus on my minor-league baseball dreams.
Shut up, my ten o'clock's here.	Wow, I think we've really hit on something here. Unfortunately, we're out of time. How does that make you feel?
Interesting, interesting....	Well, I'm positively sick of her shakin' her lady parts for the whole world to eyeball.
Buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own Marge.	Interesting, interesting....
Good idea, honey. Buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?	Maybe we should stop here.
Just sign your name above President Lincoln's.	Uh yeah, sure.
And I say a monkey can mow our lawn!	Isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? They're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now.
I stole a rack of fur coats. I sell one a year to pay for Christmas.	This house is spectacular. You must have had a great view of the riots!
Why, 'cause I'm fat?	You make me laugh, Homer.
Like I always say: compromise is the key.	Oooh.
Let's compromise and say nobody said it.	I always say that.
Hey Tabitha, great show. I like that part where you mentioned Springfield. Did you know that's where you are?	That's it! We're outta here.
Oh, you're so hot.	Hey, why don't you stay and have a bite?
If only I'd seen you before I met my wife.	Oh, you're so hot.
Don't tell the hamburger in my car.	Oh Homer, you're sweet, but... oh, you're talking to the chicken.
Okay.	Listen, these shows always tense me up. While your fingers are greasy, could you give me a neck rub?
So, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?	Okay.
Oh yeah...	Oh yes, yes it feels so good.
Thank God I brought protection.	Oh yeah...
I used to be so embarrassed buying these.	Thank God I brought protection.
Oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock.	Homer Simpson! You're supposed to be my marriage counselor. I did workbook pages for you!
Cancellations require twenty-four hours No-tice.	There ain't gonna be a three o'clock.
Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull.	Dad, because you and Mom screwed up Buck Mitchell's marriage, some kids beat me up at school today.
I didn't want you to learn that word this way.	Oh, Papa.
Marge, we've gotta get Buck and Tabitha back together. This is the most important case of our careers!	I didn't want you to learn that word this way.
Oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. Real fair. Class act.	Listen, Bub. We are out of the marriage counseling business. And the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. But not me, 'cause I think they're disgusting.
I'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. And I'll do it with or without you!	Oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. Real fair. Class act.
But I wanted to do it with you.	Then I guess you'll do it without me.
It's working! Buck's buying my fake message! And you said it would never work.	Said Zeppelin has a whole lotta love.
Uh... she was here a minute ago. She must be pooping.	Where are you, sweetie?
Great. But enough of the baseball analogies. They sicken me.	Well, Homer, it looks like my marriage is going into extra innings.
Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits.	No problem.
Wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!	Actually, you can really keep costs down when you don't pay for materials or labor... or permits... or land.
"He's talkin' like the guy in ""Fat Albert."" Howba areba youba?"	You've raised a savage beast!
Whyba youba doba thatba?	Homer!
Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!	You said you meant to make brownies. Any other lies?
Why can't you do anything?	Oh Michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower.
Dirt nap, eh? Hm...	With Fat Tony doin' the morphine mambo, the Calabresis are gonna try to put him down for a dirt nap.
Sorry, Marge, can't hear ya!	Homer, our house is on fire! Help me save the children!
This is all my daughter's fault. But I'll make it up to you. Bart and I will run your business till your Dad's okay.	I don't know what to do.
"Everything. And I learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""Shark Tale""."	Well, what do you know about being a mob boss?
Leave him to me.	This guy in here owes us money.
Ow! I hurt my fist and my palm. I thought you guys were lookin' out for me.	Leave him to me.
All right, tap jockey, you owe Fat Tony fifty bucks. Cough it up!	Ow! I hurt my fist and my palm. I thought you guys were lookin' out for me.
Just get the money.	Look Mister, I-I-I don't got the cash. My clientele -- they're all bums. They never pay!
Okay. Take it, take it! Just don't hurt me!	Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!
Okay pretty boy, where's Fat Tony's fifty bucks?	Okay. Take it, take it! Just don't hurt me!
It'll do for now.	Look, all-all-all I got is twenty-five. I swear! I swear!
Uh, it fell off a truck. You know, a truck-truck.	Homer, where did you get that truck?
No problem. I'll be back in ten minutes.	Homer, Helen Lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. Could you pick it up?
You monster! Just cut his Achilles tendon with this knife.	Dad, you want I should plug him in the ankle?
But this is the only life I know!	Bart... Mr. Simpson. We are getting out of the mob business, right now.
Can I still talk with my hands?	I'm sorry. I just can't live with myself, seeing you this way.
What about with my ears?	I'm afraid not.
Lady. Man. Lady. Man. Lady.	And I can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
Hey, if I poisoned them, would I be doing this?	Someone poisoned these meatballs. Homer...?
Marge, could you let it go? You won. She's dead!	Class all the way.
Yeah, put a leash on him, lady!	Your son is out of control!
Spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! Just give us the pills. Clear-cut his brain down to the nub!	Oh dear. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
Thank you, Doctor. Marge?	Spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! Just give us the pills. Clear-cut his brain down to the nub!
I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.	Why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
Transport yourself to the shores of Nova Scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--	I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.
So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!	He's just drumming louder!
And a circus fire!	So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!
Sleep tight, my angel!	And a circus fire!
Boy, get dressed. You're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!	Just make it happen!
I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!	I thought you wanted me to drum!
I love you so much. Damn you!	I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!
Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!	I was jamming with Skinny Turner and Marbles Le Marquez! And they want me to join their trio!
Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you.	Bart, a rising star like you needs a manager, and Gil's your guy! Oh, I'm a jazz daddy from way back...with the skit-skat skittily boom-de-boom, and the ding-dong daddy... is that jazz? That's jazz, right? Cha-cha-cha with the curly fries!
And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.	Okay, guys. No one knows you're here, so be quiet. And if you get hungry, there are rats living in the Christmas decorations.
And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?	I feel so terrible. I just wanted to save those animals while Bart became a drummer... but I never thought the two stories would intersect.
Beware of el Taco Belly!	And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?
No mas! No mas!	Beware of el Taco Belly!
Not if I can help it, Lisa!	I guess that's it. These animals are all gonna die.
Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did.	Do you have an idea?
I guess.	UMA SHANG SHANG / UMA SHANG SHANG / UMA SHANG SHANG. Is like eh, Bruce Springsteen the Boss. Ya?
Deal!	If you buy now, I give you tooth ache cream. Tooth ache cream.
Ooh, gummy worms!	Oh no, I won a free game!
Don't tell me how many times to think!	Uh, that candy's been here an awfully long time. I'd think twice if I were you.
Then stand back!	You are not bringing that thing home.
We already own a book!	Well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse.
Cool, a carpenter's library!	"""Wisconsin From Above,"" ""Veterans' Day Parades,"" ooh, ""Smiles of Ireland""! Redheaded twins? Their mother must have her hands full!"
This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is.	Cool, a carpenter's library!
Oh yeah? Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah...	Well, I like the idea of you as a handyman... and I love the idea of you reading!
I did! I made a foot rest.	Homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?
What's the point? We're all slowly dying.	Don't you have any follow-through on anything?
You sure are, sweetie -- I love this bed you made.	It's so unfair -- I'm as handy as any man.
Yep, it'll do that.	Homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!
"""Simpsons Manly-Man Handyman"" at your service."	Yep, it'll do that.
No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.	Superlative! Please install a doggie door sized for a teacup poodle.
Marge, the coast is clear.	No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.
"Oh, uh, that was me. You know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."""	I'm terribly sorry. I thought I heard the sound of a woman measuring.
"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""	Yes, but you're holding your hammer backwards.
It's allll good.	"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
...Annnd done.	Uh-oh, switch!
Listen... what would you say if I told you a woman did most of the work?	Mm-hmm! Simpson, you're a master craftsman.
Uh... Like all manly men, I have a vivid imagination.	Why did my hypothetical scenario scare you so?
Mmm... extra-virgin...	Okay, gimme all your peanuts, Goobers and Fluffer Nutters.
That Shirley is quite a gal. We should fix her up with Barney.	This is Shirley. Yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. Goodbye!
Marge, giving me credit was your idea. Now could you rub my butt? I sat on it so much it's a little sore.	Homie... I think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. I mean, look at your t-shirt!
He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.	Why does Lenny need a windmill anyway?
Switch!	He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
Who'd you think would help me, my wife? Heh.	And to think you built this whole thing with your own two hands.
"Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""	Are you ready to be lightly assaulted?
...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, infinity. I never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town.	BUDDY YOU'RE A BOY MAKE A BIG NOISE / PLAYIN' IN THE STREET GONNA BE A BIG MAN SOME DAY...
Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster.	Homer, it's time people knew the truth: I'm doing the work and I want the credit.
By the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. If the kids ask, I did it.	Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster.
"Now as I see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."	This is not going to end well.
"We need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."	"Now as I see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
Hmm... let me mull that over.	Mr. Simpson, shouldn't we begin by securing the struts?
What are struts?	Hmm... let me mull that over.
I don't know anything about struts.	What are struts?
And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!	So what? He's paying us fifty grand.
Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.	Let's go home.
Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?	Dad, here's a thought: if you just gave Mom credit, maybe she could help you.
To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day.	I'd like a Daddy who lived in the real world.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and out-of-town roller-coaster weirdoes.	Nooooo!
And now I give you... the Zoominator!	Perfect.
And now to get stinking drunk!	Ooooooooooooooooooooh!
Sure, I'll tell them the truth...	Dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!
The truth is that I'm perfect and everything I touch is perfect!	Sure, I'll tell them the truth...
I've never felt saferrrr!	"Oh my God, he'll kill himself! He'll never hear me say ""I told you so!"""
Uh-oh. Oh. Why must we preserve America's historic roller coasters?	I've never felt saferrrr!
Thank you honey!	Uh-oh. Oh. Why must we preserve America's historic roller coasters?
Everyone! My stupid male pride made me lie to you. Everything I claiiimed I did was actually built by Maaarge!	Thank you honey!
Avenge me!	Homer, I was pretty upset with you, but in the end, I... I... I-beam!
Marge, I realized something when I was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. I'm just glad I have you as my safety bar.	Avenge me!
Hey, that's great. Let's look at it after.	Look! A shooting star!
You always find an excuse not to make out.	That almost tore my head off!
Ooh, a space marshmallow!	You always find an excuse not to make out.
Where do you think you're going?	Ooh, a space marshmallow!
If he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?	Dad, no! It could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!
Marge, I ate it, it's over.	How could you eat that goo? You don't know what galaxy it's from!
Oh no you don't!	Marge, I ate it, it's over.
Must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping.	If I can keep down Arby's I can keep down you!
Still hungry.	Must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping.
Son! Let me have a lick at you.	Dad?
Nag, nag, nag.	Homer! You won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?
Uh, no. Just gas.	Is that the cat?
I'll savor you!	The flames are sealing in my juices!
No.	Tell my friends I died kissing a girl!
Must eat more fat people. Thank God I'm in America!	Oh, right.
I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.	I LIKE BIG GUTS AND I CANNOT LIE / DOUBLE CHINS WITH THE CHAFING THIGHS / WHEN A DUDE WALKS IN WITH THE HANGING JOWLS, AND MY STOMACH STARTS TO GROWL / I'M GETTIN' HUNGRY / SO I MASTICATE / CHOMPING ON THE OVERWEIGHT / I EAT FAT PEOPLE FOR DAYS / LIKE POTATO CHIPS BY LAY'S / TRY TO EAT JUST ONE, BUT IT CAN'T BE DONE / I'VE GOT TO EAT A TON / BABY LIKES FAT / BABY LIKES FAT
Dr. Phil McGraw!	Homer, I need to talk to you.
You're right. Starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner.	You've got a weight problem, and you know it.
That's ridiculous, talking fudge.	Aren't you?
Marge! I missed you! All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.	Homer, your family's here. And you gotta help me help them help you help me help you.
Well, back to the drawing board.	Marge! I missed you! All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.
"What happened to ""for better or for worse?!"""	I have to be honest with you -- I can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
It's amazing. He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.	Dad, you're eating Dr. Phil!
Marge, to keep you in my life, I'd do anything. There must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community.	Food does not equal love!
Hey, Milhouse.	Bart, there's something I have to tell you father to son. I passed out on your turtle and killed it. Someday you'll thank me.
What's goin' on?	"Can't you read my writing? I didn't say kick Homer's ""walls""."
Hey boy, where's your mud buddy? I have a little job for him.	"""Kill the Czar""? Now that's an old one."
Yeah, get him a woman. That'll end his misery!	The cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
This hurts so much.	Yeah, get him a woman. That'll end his misery!
Writing's for nerds.	Just write a scroll, asking him to stop.
Hey, I'm not done dancin'! This bulletin better swing!	We interrupt this dance music from the Meridian Room in Capitol City's fabulous Hotel Hitler, to bring you a special bulletin.
Flanders?	Astronomers say the ominous capsules originated from Earth's closest neighbor...
So, it's a war of the worlds. Good thing we've got the sun on our side.	Mars!
Go ahead and hide, you coward!	So, it's a war of the worlds. Good thing we've got the sun on our side.
Burn everything!	"Well I just hope our saucy little radio prank will give these ""folks,"" as you call them, a giggle, a gasp, and provide a good lead-in for Misters Amos and Andy."
That's alien talk!	You know, Homer, we haven't actually seen these aliens.
It was either kill him or kill no one!	I'm proud of what I achieved during my rioting.
Lisa, that was just a radio show.	Dad! A flying saucer blew up that statue!
Eh, big deal -- by the time Bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! We're China, right?	What?! Homer! Our son joined the Army!
Sorry, guys. You know, his mother's the one who made me come down here.	Okay Mr. Simpson, we'll tear up your son's contract.
Go on.	Sounds uh, like you're kind of tired of being bossed around at home.
Wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?	Would you be interested in, um... I don't know, joining the army?
Woo hoo! Where do I sign?	Hey, a big target like you will be home a lot sooner than that.
Now where's my parade? Where's my parade?	Woo hoo! Where do I sign?
"Ooh, ""Who makes what in America."" Army private: fourteen thousand a year."	We have this issue of Parade Magazine.
I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?	Homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home.
You? Don't make me laugh! You couldn't--	I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
Aw, no, daddy's just teasing. Of course you could. You could keep it under a hundred. Yes, you could.	You? Don't make me laugh! You couldn't--
No she couldn't.	Aw, no, daddy's just teasing. Of course you could. You could keep it under a hundred. Yes, you could.
Are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'Cause mine is I care too much.	At-ten-tion! Ordinarily I would spend the next two hours questioning your sexuality, running down your hometowns, and telling you to drop and give me various numbers.
Snowflake?! What happens to me in the summer?	Here's your nicknames: Brooklyn, Hollywood, Kissimmee-St. Cloud Florida, Maverick, Blanket Hog, Newman's Own, Master of Suspense, England's Rose, Nickname Pending, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Snowflake...
I don't understand. How does punishing them teach me a lesson?	A troublemaker, huh? You're gonna sit here and eat donuts, while the rest of the unit does push-ups.
Man, you've got an awesome voice.	Okay, listen up!
"Can you say ""Side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"""	Well, thank you.
Hm, sounded better in my head.	"Can you say ""Side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"""
Everyone got an assignment but us.	Frontline infantry!
I wonder what makes us so special.	Everyone got an assignment but us.
That's an odd way to start handing out medals.	Gentlemen, I'll be frank. Never before has the army accepted recruits with test scores as low as yours.
Are we that stupid?	I'm not handing out medals. But I am gonna give you a special assignment. The Army is conducting war games and we want you to play the enemy.
Nope. I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!	So they're not shipping you overseas?
Okay, these are war games and I'm head of my team. I have to think like a great military leader.	Don't worry, Dad. You'll do great.
I will!	Stay crunchy in milk!
Stay crunchy, men! Stay crunchy!	I will!
Oh my God, I just remembered. It's Chinese New Year!	This'll be like shootin' cats offa gramma's sofa.
Gung hay fat choi! Gung hay fat choi!	Oh my God, I just remembered. It's Chinese New Year!
Americans!	Gung hay fat choi! Gung hay fat choi!
Bring it on, chumps!	Oh. Guess I'd better do my part.
Fingers, fingers, fingers!	Bring it on, chumps!
Moe, Moe, you gotta hide us from the Army!	That's how it works? I was just drawin' wangs on the numbers.
"Not that Army, the one from ""Stripes!"""	The Salvation Army? You got it.
Thanks, Moe. How can I ever repay you?	Okay.
Well, what have we got?	Hey! They's usin' live ammo!
Rise my pretties! Find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!	Well, what have we got?
I'm not gonna surrender. You've seen what the U.S. Army does to prisoners. How would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?	Well, you'd better hurry. I don't think Dad can last much longer where he's hiding.
Yeah, Marge always loves your cards. Well, you may not be the smartest guys in the Army...	That was our last Christmas card.
"""H"" means ""hot""?!"	I'd give anything to hear Homer's voice.
Stupid Army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance.	"""H"" means ""hot""?!"
Predator drone!	It's not giant and it's not in the distance! It's small and it's in our room!
Hmm... Let's see what your hangover has to say!	Don't you dare go limp!
Dudes! Wanna make some extra spending money? Get a free pair of boots? Hey baby, you like obstacle courses?	Don't you worry, ma'am. A man of your husband's ingenuity can be put to very good use.
Thinking it over, huh? I'm cool with that.	Dudes! Wanna make some extra spending money? Get a free pair of boots? Hey baby, you like obstacle courses?
Hey, pal. Like the way you handle that mop. You like killing? Hey, ladies. Are you tired of waiting for sanctions to work? I know I am.	Thinking it over, huh? I'm cool with that.
Hmm... I must be supposed to remember something.	Frontline infantry. Absolutely Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Coastguard! Where do they find these people? Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Lord. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Navy. Have a seat. Frontline infantry. Where'd you come-- Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry was made for you. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry. The lowest test score. Frontline infantry. You make me sick. Frontline infantry. Frontline infantry.
Is it our anniversary? No, we don't have one this year. Hmmm...	C'mon, memory, wake up!
Don't forge? Don't forge what?	Is it our anniversary? No, we don't have one this year. Hmmm...
Ohhh, don't forget. Don't forget what?!	Don't forge? Don't forge what?
The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!	Hustle your bustles, gang! We're going to the Senior Olympics to root for Grampa!
Too late. The deed is done.	The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!
This guy sucks. He can barely make it to the top.	There are others?
Oh, I was supposed to take Moe fishing today! Everybody hide!	I wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
Says you.	Homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives.
Whoa, Marge, who'd you piss off?	Dear Pus Bag...
"Moe, you live in a hotel? You're just like ""Eloise""!"	Thanks. So here's my digs.
This vibrating massage chair feels great!	Did someone say my name?
Oooh, Moe's a poet! He has a soul! Flutter your wings! It's teatime in Buttercup Junction!	What you've got here is poetry!
Moe's the Princess of Lollipop Land! He lunches on lavender and potpourri!	Oooh, Moe's a poet! He has a soul! Flutter your wings! It's teatime in Buttercup Junction!
Seriously Moe, I think you have a gift.	Moe's the Princess of Lollipop Land! He lunches on lavender and potpourri!
Ooh, you love a man!	Thanks, Homer. I love ya, man.
Do not mention that publication in this house! They never published my poem!	"I don't care about my grade. I'm gonna send Moe's poem to ""American Poetry Perspectives."""
There once was a rapping tomato / That's right, I said rapping tomato / He rapped all day / From April to May / And also, guess what, it was me.	Do not mention that publication in this house! They never published my poem!
Ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?	I'm not here.
Lousy. I gotta go to Vermont for some stupid poetry thing.	I'm gonna walk away then, okay.
Fine. I'll drive between sips.	Homer, don't drink and drive!
They got an open bar at this thing, right?	Fine. I'll drive between sips.
Wow. Troopers from every state in New England.	They got an open bar at this thing, right?
It's gonna be awesome!	Lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! We're going Vermonting!
Man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses.	It's gonna be awesome!
Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!	You guys go ahead. I don't think I'd be very good company...
I love these covered bridges. It's like driving through cute little houses.	Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!
Oh I'm sorry. We should exchange insurance information. I have none.	That was my house, you moron!
Make my daughter cry, will ya! Eat syrup, jerk!	Lisa, if you could just forgive me, you would make me the happiest man in Vermont. Except for those two dudes I saw gettin' hitched. Not my thing, but I wish 'em well.
No, not now.	Homer, would it make you feel better if any of that hit me?
Hmmm... maple syrup. Sleigh on the label, very good.	Okay, then poems about Spider-Man! And I want them finished before you start! And before you finish, get me some coffee! And the poems should have the following rhyme scheme: A-B-B-A-A-B-B-A-C-D-E-C-D-E! What are you waitin' for? Chinese New Year?
Rich maple color, good swirl...	Hmmm... maple syrup. Sleigh on the label, very good.
Oh, Jemima!	Rich maple color, good swirl...
I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.	So what? That's legal in Rolo-Polo!
What'd I do?	Oh, in that case...
Hey Marge, want a thousand dollars?	What'd I do?
You're not ice cream... faker!	Come and lick me, Big Boy! I said lick me!
Ice cream man! Wait!	You're not ice cream... faker!
Ice cream man! Ice cream man!	That's more like it.
One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please.	Homer, there you are! What does my best customer want today?
Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. Change a hundred?	I wish I had more customers like you. I'm barely scraping by.
Nooooo!	...ninety-nine-fifty... ninety-nine-seventy-five...
Max told you about me?	You must be Homer.
This is the most fun I've ever had giving you wood.	Max told you about me?
Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay...	And now I'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck.
Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right.	You'll buy Max's truck?
Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?	Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right.
Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!	How can we forget? Mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
He was following my design.	Otto, you totally pimped Dad's ride!
And now to get dressed in a most unusual way:	He was following my design.
Butter-brickle!	And now to get dressed in a most unusual way:
You kids like ice cream?	Eh, what the hell.
What's the matter, son? Don't you have enough money for ice cream?	I'm a unitard!
Son, I will not stand for intolerance!	I do, but I'm lactose-intolerant.
You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. God bless America!	Son, I will not stand for intolerance!
I said, God bless America!	But my doctor says that I...
Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!	Call the number on my bracelet.
Whoa Marge, for the first time in my life, I'm excited about going to work!	Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!
You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?	I'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
Marge, you're a genius. You should make sculptures of other people! Like Lenny, or Carl, or the new James Bond. Will America accept a British James Bond? I can't wait to find out!	Noooo! I mean, yes!
Honey, I brought you more sticks.	Aw, you're shivering, are you cold? Where you goin', Marge?
It's good to see you smile again. I was lonely being happy all by myself.	Homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. I'm as hopeful and full of life as I was in the years before I met you.
Let me just put on some romantic music.	Well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
Marge, everything looks wonderful!	Hey, I do more than TV. I had a one-man show on Broadway. That's who showed up -- one man! Long story short, I won a Drama Desk Award.
Well, I'm off to pedal my frosty wares!	Marge, everything looks wonderful!
Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show.	You can't go to work! I need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you.	The show starts at three. You promise you'll be here?
Attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love.	Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!
Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream.	Hey, give me one of everything! Hey!
Marge's show!	Already? It's only thirty-eight seconds to three.
Must jettison excess weight!	Marge's show!
Oh my God, I've only got nine seconds till Marge's show!	Must jettison excess weight!
I'll never make it! Unless...	Homer, where are you?
Woo hoo! I'm gonna be on time!	I'll never make it! Unless...
I made it back for your show, honey...	See, statements like that are why people think we're gay.
Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families...	Well, Homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. Good job. Very thorough.
Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!	Oh, stop. Just stop. You don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!
Marge? Marge?	Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!
Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. Marge?	Marge? Marge?
Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?	Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. Marge?
Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?	Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?
That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday.	Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?
Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art.	That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday.
If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?	Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art.
If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down.	If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?
I'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs.	If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down.
Marge?	I'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs.
Marge?	Marge?
Marge, where are you? Did you change your name? Is it Kelly? Kelly!!!	Mom! Mom!
Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!	There's Mom!
The world's not that interested!	Homer, I wanna show the world how I feel about you.
Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.	Homer, you wanted a sign that I still love you, so here it is.
I just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?	Now I know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
Yeah? Well I wish I'd married Patty and Selma!	You're the worst husband in the world!
You used to love it!	Don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
Recording that fake fight was a great idea.	You used to love it!
And, as always, have fun watching.	Dear Lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy.
GOOOO... LOVEMAKING!	And, as always, have fun watching.
And I hate the cutesy way you make Jack-o-lanterns! I like scary Halloween, not funny Halloween!	GOOOO... LOVEMAKING!
Oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. But you still have to go.	Dad, don't make me go! I'll give you a back rub!
Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!	Why?
Too late.	Yeah.
Yeah. How'd you afford this kick-ass party?	Look at our kids! Playin' like champs!
Woo hoo! Marital sex!	When you're done putting Lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day.
Okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night.	Woo hoo! Marital sex!
But your mother smells like coconut!	Dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?
Okay sweetie, which book should I read?	But your mother smells like coconut!
Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups.	"""Angelica Button and the Dragon King's Trundle Bed"". It's the ninth book in the ""Angelica Button"" series."
"""Chapter One: The RubyStone in the Door-Portal"". Are you asleep yet?"	Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups.
Tomorrow? But she's in trouble now! I'll just read ahead without you.	Oh Dad, I'm tired. We'll read more tomorrow.
Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie. Nighty-night.	No! We have to read it together.
Lisa, I'm home! Time for me to read to you!	Life was perfect.
Lady, you're nice, but I'm married.	You must read ahead. Fiction is your passion!
Ow! I can't read ahead -- I promised Lisa I wouldn't!	Just read the book, you shaved ape.
"""An Unexpected Occurrence?!"" What could it be?!"	Just take a peek at the title of the next chapter and see if you can resist.
Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...	Yes, quite.
...As Headmaster Greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb.	Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
He killed Greystash!	Greystash.
Oh, Greystash. Greystash! Oh, hello, Lisa.	Only till two thousand eight! Look into it!
Uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to Greystash?	C'mon Dad, read the last chapter! Everyone says there's a big surprise -- I bet Angelica discovers that she's a wizard!
Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...	Come on, read, read!
Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said...	Why are you stopping? We're almost at the happy ending!
Uh, they went to Star Wars Land and fought star wars.	Is that really how it ends? What happened to the Merlinical Council?
Now Lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.	Dad, you can read to me anytime.
Greystash! Greystash!	Haw haw, I touched your heart!
Don't say his name! In your mouth it sounds like dirt!	Gee, you're really upset about this Greystash thing.
No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man!	Homer, it's just a book.
Just think, Lisa, if I had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!	Awwww!
Look out! It's the Grumple!	Grumply, grumply groo, I'll throw my net over you!
Give back that Holiday Cheer, you bastard!	Come on, Homer, let's get the kids out of here. Homer?
You're getting a cab, old man. In fact, I believe I see it now.	Yeah! Maybe I should spend the night here, too.
Your present is leaving.	But I haven't given you a present.
Marge, we have a problem here.	Well, I figured since you invited me to stay, I might as well go down to the bus locker and get my stuff.
Do you think that's the same Grumple from the ice show? Because I do.	Grumply, grumply groo, your blood will make my stew!
Why did you let that loser into our home?	Kinda.
Christian Charity? What does a porn star have to do with this? He's gotta go!	I'll tell you why: Christian charity.
Really? Who's gonna make him?	I promise you, he'll leave after today.
He sure has a lot of markers that don't work.	I will.
Don't worry, I make six of those a year.	"Well, I got something...a spider bite. Or as I like to call it, a ""Christmas kiss."""
Lower the boom!	Wait, you don't have a place to live?
Has the boom been lowered?	I guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
We're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!	Y'know those floats should really slow down and savor it. 'Cause your life can go to hell pretty quick.
Oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors.	He's still in need, we have to let him stay. It's what Dr. King would want us to do.
"Marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. That's why you have three kids."	Please, just a few more days.
Yes we are.	"It's true -- I do have trouble saying ""no."" It all started when I was seven..."
Marge, I have no idea what you were just thinking about. Why would you think I did?	"And that's why I have trouble saying ""no"" to people -- even Gil!"
Yeah, but there's something else. There's this loser staying in our house. Marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does.	What'sa matter, Homer? Do you still miss the UPN?
Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- You again?!	Well, you can't kick him out, 'cause then Marge will never learn to assert herself.
What the hell is this thing?	Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- You again?!
Those legs go on forever. Oh wait, they stop right there.	Homie, wake up! I rented that negligee you like.
A heart-shaped box of chocolates.	Homer, don't forget it's Valentine's Day! Whatcha gettin' the Mrs.?
For your information, since I bought it I put on a ton of weight.	Well, I'm still a winner. As long as I've got a cup-a coffee and a tomorrow on the calendar, Ol' Gil's comin' back. Say Homer, how 'bout closin' up that robe? I'm seeing the whole butcher shop.
Their drunken singing is ruining St. Patrick's day!	A CREDIT TO OLD IRELAND/ IS MACNAMARA'S BAND.
Scottsdale? Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?	I'll tell you what. We're going to Scottsdale!
Then forget it!	Sure!
And to think, he and I once shared a shower.	Whoa, Gil's a big shot!
A hundred and seventeen degrees! Ooo, that reminds me.	I don't care how successful Gil is, he's still a mooch, and I need to tell him off!
There's water under the seat!	A hundred and seventeen degrees! Ooo, that reminds me.
I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.	I was so happy on that island...
I've never seen Marge like a DVD about a place so much. I'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her iPod.	I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.
Marge, I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to get that movie onto your iPod... so I'm taking the family on a surprise vacation to Barnacle Bay!	I've never seen Marge like a DVD about a place so much. I'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her iPod.
We left plenty of food so you won't starve.	Ta-da!
I was talking to the cat!	We left plenty of food so you won't starve.
Oh Marge, I'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate.	This was my favorite seahorse. I called him Mr. Funnygoodfeeling... Oh God, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!
You could caramel my arm...	Dip your berries? / Powder your jellies?
"I didn't say ""stop."""	I make it nice and sticky, heh?
It's not sugar, it's caramel!	Homer, that's too much sugar!
I bet it was Bill Clinton's fault.	Excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. What happened?
Slick Willie wiggles out of another one.	No, no, it was long before him.
Oh, I can't stand to see your mother unhappy. But this town could be great for your mother again. And I know three people who can make it happen.	I guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember.
Nice brush work, Emily. Nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her.	Oh, I can't stand to see your mother unhappy. But this town could be great for your mother again. And I know three people who can make it happen.
Oh, they're getting a little exercise.	Homer, this is wonderful. Where are the kids?
All night long, baby.	Can I go again?
A green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:	Aaahhh!
I think the hook is touching my brain. .	Well, at least they left your underwear on. That was nice of them.
Dammit!	My husband meant no harm. There must be some way he can pay for what he did. He's good at opening jars.
Queer strange or queer gay?	I say let him fish it off. These waters are so barren, by the time he pays the debt, he'll be as old and as queer as I am!
How many yum-yum fish did we get?	Great man, now I need a new thing.
Ew, it tastes terrible!	None. Just a few slarg fish.
Finally. Something even I wouldn't eat. Well, maybe a little more.	No, you don't eat it. Its oil is used to polish stripper poles.
Terrible.	Finally. Something even I wouldn't eat. Well, maybe a little more.
Here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.	Terrible.
Uh... I thought today was Opposite Day. By the way, you're very ugly. It's Opposite Day.	Wait, this is bait! Homer, I told you to beer batter the shrimp and bait the hooks. Did you do the opposite?
So that means... it is Opposite Day.	It's not Opposite Day!
I don't know what to say.	We're gonna be rich! And it's all thanks to you, Homer! Or should I say... Chief Fish Clubber Homer!
Dear Marge, how are you? I am fine. The waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. And the salt water is rising. What's next? Pepper water? Ha ha. Love ya, Homer Simpson.	Oh Homie, I'm so worried. But if I concentrate, our love is so strong, I know I can hear your thoughts.
Bart!? What the hell are you doing in there?!	This old barge can't take much more! Take out the life raft!
Aw, son.	Dad... I couldn't stay with Mom and Lisa while you were out here.
You did the right thing, boy.	They were gonna go to the Folk Art Museum, then they were gonna paint crab shells. Not crush them, paint them.
Watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!	Yeah, but still...
Yeahhhh!	Watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!
Shiiiii... pwreck!	Yeahhhh!
Uh... sure we will, son. Right, Captain?	We're still gonna make it, aren't we Dad?
Should I hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?	Absolutely. Bart, the sea wouldn't dare take the life of an apple-cheeked young lad like yourself.
What's the code word?	Not yet.
Oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the Greeks called you Poseidon, the Romans... Aquaman. Look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again.	What's the code word?
Do you think your Mother will ever remarry?	Oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the Greeks called you Poseidon, the Romans... Aquaman. Look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again.
Why you little...	In about two seconds.
The hell we are!	All we do know is they're in Heaven now, hanging their lines off a cloud, and fishin' for airplanes.
Well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly...	How did you make it?
Oh my God! It's beautiful!	Well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly...
Wait a minute. How am I breathing?	Welcome, Homer, to our watery realm.
Then when all seemed lost...	You're not!
I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!	Lot of garbage fish today.
Then they brought us home...	I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!
So, that's our story. Oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. He turned out to be pretty cool.	Then they brought us home...
Ah! Nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.	This is not what I wanted at all!
Which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?	Ah! Nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.
You're all idiots. I'm putting it on Chill Thunder Lite.	"""Chill Thunder""! ""Chill Thunder""!"
Hey! Nobody cuts me off!	Outta my way, ya seatbelt wearin' cowards!
How's it goin'?	Hey! Nobody cuts me off!
Then what's America doing in Iraq?	Homer, no! Revenge never solves anything.
May we? May we? Mais oui!	Papa, may we have petit fours?
Treason?! But I love France! The way all our words are either a girl or a guy! Oh, that's the best!	You're under arrest for treason!
I don't want the kids to see me this way!	Tell it to le baton!
I didn't write that! Even if I did love England, I'd play it cool. Wait for it to come to me.	Uh... deux... troi....
You moron! I'm already alive!	I sentence you to life...
I shouldn't be here, I was framed!	I'm gonna stop now.
Are you gonna torture me?	Hey wait, did you guys hear that? He just admitted it! Guys? Oh man, this place is so unfair.
Nine a.m.?!	Now get some sleep -- you've got a nine a.m. Rat Helmet.
I swear revenge on Meaux! Even if it takes me the rest of my life! Can you loosen my arm so I can shake my fist?	Nine a.m.?!
REVENGE! Okay.	You're the traitor.
Oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane.	Thank you.
Now I have nothing.	Oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane.
Where did you come from?	Perhaps I may be of help.
Oh sorry, I wasn't listening. I was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. Lookin' good.	I'm your cellmate. You never noticed me, because, frankly, you're extremely self-centered.
And decrepit.	I spent thirty years digging this tunnel, but now I can't use it. I'm simply too old.
Oooh, the the! But why are you helping me?	But you can escape -- and use this map to retrieve my buried treasure. With it, you can have your revenge!
So this map leads to a treasure, huh?	Well, because before my wretched life comes to a close, I want to know that I had one friend. Also, because while you slept, I violated you repeatedly.
I wonder how long this tunnel...	So this map leads to a treasure, huh?
...iiiiiis!	I wonder how long this tunnel...
Ew! Silver!	Mon Dieu! Weee!
Ooh, a penny!	Ew! Silver!
This is my lucky day.	Ooh, a penny!
Madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen.	When we meet the count, do you think he'll like us? / I've heard rumors he's mysterious!
Here it is: The Harmless Chair of Relaxation!	Monsieur Meaux, I would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment.
Little do you know that the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.	I've heard about these things. They're good for doin' the wife, right?
I have returned!	Ma?...
Oui oui! And I have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!	Homer, you're back!
Yes, my love?	Homer...
You guys liked him?	Papa Meaux! Papa Meaux!
But Marge, I did it all for you!	We were together for five years! Now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
It takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! Plus, in the middle, I had to take revenge on some of my contractors.	For me, huh? What took you so long?
Oh, right -- revenge!!	Weren't you listening? I just told you a whole story about revenge.
I'm gonna get my revenge! And if I get caught, I'm pinning it on the baby like the time I shot Mr. Burns.	Oh, right -- revenge!!
"Is it ""The Count of Monte Cristo?"" 'Cause I love that story."	Dad, wait, I've got a story about why revenge is wrong.
Wow. That had what I really like in a story: an ending.	Haw haw! You forgot about me 'cause I had the mumps!
No, sweetie. The lesson is: never put down your weapon.	The point, Dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm.
Revenge!	No, sweetie. The lesson is: never put down your weapon.
This is it. It's taken all day, we've missed our flight to Hawaii, but finally, I'll get my revenge.	Look at that view. It reminds me how insignificant we are in the world. Yee haw!
You? You're too dumb to tell a story.	Dad, wait! You haven't heard my story.
No, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it.	You? You're too dumb to tell a story.
Parents who are still alive, I might add.	You should feel lucky. Not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.
You don't frighten me!	Hand over your wallet!
Or my wife!	You don't frighten me!
Or my...	Or my wife!
Avenge me. In flamboyant impractical fashion.	Shut up!
That's okay, boy. The two of us got to talking.	So you see, revenge is great. And there's three ways to talk about it. Although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a Halloween story...
Two.	Look at all them stars. How many do you think there are?
I don't know. Let's just lay here till we figure it out.	What the?! Two?! You think there are two?! Well, I never, how could-- Why do you think it is that mankind is so inclined towards hatin' one another?
Now what do they want?	Tomorrow's Multicultural Day at school.
Camera's broken!	Aw, Grampa. We should take lots of pictures of him while we still can.
Oh, I can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson.	Where do you think you're goin'?
Hey, that jerk cut us off! Pull alongside!	Oh, I can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson.
Eat Marshall Tucker, idiot!	Hey, that jerk cut us off! Pull alongside!
Floor it!	Homer, is that you?!
Whoa, you just blew my mind!	And that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? They had seven names for that.
What's your hurry?	Show's over, let's go!
Aw, my little girl's just like CBS News.	Well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked.
Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight.	Hey, guys. I'll see you in a bit. I entered a thousand mile Baja Road race.
This cell phone is so I can call you whenever I need your driving services. I've put in my own ring tone!	Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight.
Hello, Bart?	This cell phone is so I can call you whenever I need your driving services. I've put in my own ring tone!
I need you to go the gas station. Tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs.	Hello, Bart?
Then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.	I need you to go the gas station. Tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs.
Bart... buddy! It's your dad! I need a ride! I think I'm in Chinatown. Not our Chinatown.	Hello?
Boy, I don't wanna freak you out, but I'm calling from inside the trunk.	Oh, man! What now?
That was me. Some very un-cool people put me in here.	Boy, I don't wanna freak you out, but I'm calling from inside the trunk.
It's dark in here!	Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Bart! This is a matter of life and death: What is the difference between ketchup and catsup?	I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? Oh, right. Darcy.
They're gonna cut my head offff...!	Bart! This is a matter of life and death: What is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
You know, my great-great grandmother was an Indian. I guess I should've mentioned that before, huh?	What? Not you, Fibbing Bear!
Simpson men get the job done!	"I just found this note in Bart's room! ""Dear Mom and Dad: Me and my girlfriend Darcy have gone to Utah to get married. F.Y.I., she's pregnant""!"
It's a tragedy, a real tragedy. I mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?	Simpson men get the job done!
I mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific American, where...	I did!
Actually... that was me.	Okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. In Colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum.
Why would I go to Utah? I love booze, caffeine, and monogamy.	"""Dingle's Berries"" in Provo, Utah?"
Did she mention she was knocked up?	Our daughter says she's run off with your son!
Oops. Sorry for the spoiler.	No!
Yeah, how 'bout that?	You know, I thought Darcy and I would be like a real married couple. Instead we just ended up fighting all the time.
Son, one day you're going to be a great father.	You know, for a while, I was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad.
Thanks, boy. Hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while I sing public domain songs out the window?	Aww. And someday you'll be one too.
Stop it, Winston!	Thank you.
The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.	Homer is so amazing! He can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
Eh?	The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
Hm... what's changed for me since the last time I saw you? Only... everything!	Oh yeah? Check with me in eight years, Dr. Who. I'll be kickin' your ass with a solid gold boot!
Why do you sound so shocked? This is our fifth take.	I can't believe it. Homer Simpson... a bloody millionaire!
Now that I'm super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. That's why rich kids turn out so well.	Wheee! /
"You see Declan, I made my millions with a simple invention -- ""The Condiment Pen""!"	INT. LAKESIDE MANSION - KITCHEN - PRESENT
Just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish.	"You see Declan, I made my millions with a simple invention -- ""The Condiment Pen""!"
I got the idea from the regular pen.	Just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish.
I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!	Can I use it on fish and chips?
He loves it!	I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!
Uh, this is Eduardo, my pool boy. He thinks he's an angry rich man.	What are you people doing in my summer home?
That's the pool chemicals talking.	I am an angry rich man!
Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. You can beat him, just don't leave marks.	Oh Fah-ther, my pony Buttercup can jump ever so high-- Hoo-boy, it's Mr. Burns.
I'll tell you why.	Then I just want to know why your husband did what he did.
It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book...	I'll tell you why.
I'll pay for most of this!	It's the oddest thing: I actually feel affection for these knuckle-dragging sub-monkeys. I feel sorry for Homer Simpson.
All right, you lured me to your bay. Now what sick game are you playing?	No thanks to you two.
Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!	I have some footage to show you.
You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!	Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!
Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.	At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. And you know what? No monsters have gotten me yet.
Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him.	Homer! Don't kill the foreign man!
All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!	Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him.
Marge, you're my real dream come true. And I get to live you every day.	All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!
"Relax, baby. While you were dreaming of me and calling me ""James,"" I took care of everything."	The family can't start the day without me!
Eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. Now don't worry: I packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world.	Homie, you woke up early?
Look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. But the school's paying for five sessions and there's a Chinese restaurant next door where I can get drunk.	Why do I have to go to a stupid psychiatrist? I told a scary story, big deal.
He's lying!	And... My Dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. He's always passed out in the parking snot.
Look at those dumb hillbillies! I bet they don't even know what... something is.	You're better than us!
Look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!	Dad, those kids aren't dumb. This show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!
Permission to moan?	Nooooo!
Okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!	How sweet it is.
Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan...	This basement is a wonderful gift to the family. But how could you afford it?
I'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!	Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan...
Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets.	Mr. Simpson, do you understand how bankruptcy works?
"What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says ""Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."""	Under the new law, you have to pay your creditors everything.
Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money.	Mr. Simpson, among the expenses the court deems frivolous: you throw over one thousand dollars a month into local wishing wells.
I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next.	"Uh-huh. Well you're going to have to make some serious cutbacks to your expenses. Three subscriptions to ""Vanity Fair?"""
Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in.	Shut up! It's an instructional website! Shut up!
"No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"	I don't wanna leave! You promised me I could die here!
"Come on, Dad, I'm cuttin' back everywhere. To save gas I'm ""Flintstone-ing"" the car."	"No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
Why are you telling me? He's your father-in-law.	Grampa's driving me crazy!
Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem.	Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.	For some reason, she doesn't trust him. Maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you.
Well, here we are, home early.	All right, lips, man your kissing stations! This is not a drill!
A talking bear is eating my father!	I'm Selma.
Dad, do you know what you were kissing? Do you? Do you?	A talking bear is eating my father!
Well I never, ever want to see that again.	Yeah, I know who I was kissing, and I also know why! I'm a little shaky on when and where, but I got my theories!
Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?	Ah, the hell with you. I just might ask that Selma girl out. And you can't tell me not to! My roof, my rules!
It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.	Pick a lane, freaks!
Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy.	Be nice, Homer. Don't you see how great it is that they found each other? Like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog.
Words hurt, you know.	Well gee, Homer, you uh, ain't exactly open-casket material yourself.
Stupid Selma and Grampa... how dare they find happiness?	Words hurt, you know.
Oh great. Who are you in love with? Bart?	It's me -- Patty.
Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk.	Look, if you wanna break up your father and Selma, I have a plan. But it involves you.
I've got a good feeling about this.	Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk.
Selma!	Hello, Homer.
Hola, I am Esteban de la Sexface. That means Stephen of the Sexface.	Do you have your disguise?
Dos Selmas? Ay-yi-yi!	What the hell is going on here?
I guess I always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.	Homer! Why would you try to break us up?
A thousand, eh?	Well, nerts to both of ya! Our love is so strong, not even a thousand crazy schemes could tear it apart!
Oh Lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet.	Dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!
Hey Selma, want some rice?	Oh Lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet.
Spooky.	Walk with me.
So... how long is Señor Homer out of town for?	Absolutely. Now how 'bout givin' an old man one last dance?
Then I must flee!	Oh, I don't know, he might come home any minute.
Where is he? Where is he? I smell his aftershave!	Then I must flee!
Where is he? I know he's in here.	I don't think we're doing this right.
I don't have to make a wish, because I already have this wonderful family. I wish for infinity hamburgers.	HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR HOMER / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
E-Z Blo...	No, Dad, they're the opposite.
This ends now!	E-Z Blo...
Uh-huh... uh-huh...	It's okay, Homie. You're probably just tired from not doing anything all day.
I'll just focus on one area... How many did I get? None? That's cool.	Dad, you're out of shape even for an American.
Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.	You could buy a fireproof safe.
Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad.	Sir, we've been here six times this month.
Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!	Okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. For me, it's the family photo album.
Used to?!	Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!
Oh, deal with it.	Used to?!
Tick tock, sweetie.	It's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. So I made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation.
I'm going with the cologne I wore on our first date.	I picked my Malibu Stacy hybrid convertible. It runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
I don't know. Maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode.	What's that coming out of the safe?
Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon...	Oh man. I thought I was strong enough to get through this again -- but I'm not.
Here I am on the space shuttle, orbiting Earth.	Bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
Marge! This isn't like you.	And they pay big money for photos.
Moderately wealthy?	This is good. Real good! Like Lindsay Lohan looking drunk, high and bony. Click, click, career over, see ya in the gutter, freckles. Homer, I'll pay ya two hundred bucks. Bring me more snaps like this, and I'll make you a moderately wealthy man!
That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?	Wheeee -- I'm sort of rich! I can rent anything I want!
Then I'll do it!	Sure, why not?
Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?	Jerks like you oughtta be shot!
How 'bout you, Gabbo?	Paparazzi?! Get lost, ya parasite!
Okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?	Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. You're gonna help me ambush them. Look at this place. Imported beer? Seedless grapes? Chewing gum?	Well, when you put it that way... Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
The clown on this cereal box is just a person!	Okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. You're gonna help me ambush them. Look at this place. Imported beer? Seedless grapes? Chewing gum?
Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build.	C'mon, baby -- barf for mama.
Look at those celebrities: I've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence.	I'm still breaking in this nose!
Oh, like you care, Betty White.	Hello, Homer. Have you lost weight?
Her name is Marge.	Tell me, how's Maggie?
Oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!	I was talking about your baby.
No problem. Hey Drederick!	Dad! It's Drederick Tatum. Try to get him to punch you.
Your hip hop CD was boastful and unnecessary!	Yes, how can I help you, my handsome friend?
What are the first three?	That's what I think of the fourth estate!
Okay.	Nobility, clergy and commoners. Learn your French history!
I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.	What the hell did you do that for?
Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room.	I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.
Well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals.	It's eleven at night and I can't get to sleep!
That photo's mine. That photo's mine. That photo's mine.	Bart gets another try!
See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down.	Well, I do like the extra money. But I think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes.
Did I attach the harness?	Okay, this is the place.
If you don't mind!	No! Should I attach it for you?
Thank you!	If you don't mind!
Now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!	Thank you!
Up, up, and annoy!	Do you, Rainier Luftwaffe Wolfcastle, take Maria Shriver-Kennedy-Quimby to be your lawful wedded--
Now Maggie, I had to use your car seat to hold the new TV Guide...so I'm gonna hang you from the mirror.	"See, it is good. I declare this meeting adjourned! Now please, take some sushi. Because if I give it to the dogs, they will think ""oh, now I get sushi all the time."" And I am not made of sushi."
He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!	Smile!
Ten and two, Einstein!	He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!
Can't I even have privacy here?!	Ten and two, Einstein!
How could you publish this? I thought we were friends!	I shall make this photo into my screensaver! Somehow.
And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.	I have no friends! Friends take time! And time is money! And money pays for things! Like a manicure! And a boiled egg! Get me one of each! But not boiled, poached! Ah, what the hell, it's Friday--scrambled! Sometimes I wish I had a twin. Not that much, though. We'd just fight.
You're right -- I'm giving up photography...	Sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. It's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine.
And my own medicine!	You're right -- I'm giving up photography...
So long, anti-clotting agent!	And my own medicine!
Clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!	So long, anti-clotting agent!
Listen to 'em. They're on top of the world while I'm sittin' here pretending I have a stool.	Leave the tray.
All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.	Listen to 'em. They're on top of the world while I'm sittin' here pretending I have a stool.
You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.	And my sister once saw Burt Reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn't even co-sign her mortgage.
Thanks, Moe!	I was gonna use it to take secret photos in the ladies' turlet. But no dames ever come in this joint!
How do you want your comeuppance: eight by ten or wallet size?	We need to trade bras and panties!
Nothing.	What are you going to do with those photos?
I want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. Sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!	Providing you celebrities do something for me.
Ooh, Papa John's.	Moving on, our class trip to Italy is now spaghetti night at Papa John's, and your fifteen-hundred dollar deposits will not be refunded.
Never!	Everyone can see you! Get inside!
Why don't I just put on a dress?!	Just put on a towel!
Not naked, I haven't.	Homer, you've met my parents.
...our duties as firemen.	Anyway, someone's here to see you.
"Wait, that's soccer? I always called it ""human foosball."" Would you like me to take you to your game?"	You tell her, Mr. Dhanabhai -- Business contacts are more important than love!
Do I have to?	You already promised you would.
"Did someone say ""snack""?"	He quit! Being a ref is a thankless job... the parents hate ya... the only upside is the kids share their snack with you.
I'll be your ref!	"Did someone say ""snack""?"
I got fired from Foot Locker.	Dad, where'd you get that outfit?
What'sa matter, buddy? The American flag not good enough for ya?	I got fired from Foot Locker.
I'm your father now.	That was my father!
I'm open! I'm open!	I'm your father now.
So... tired.	I'm open! I'm open!
So... I thought it went real well. Until I swallowed the whistle.	Could someone bring me another barf cone?
Hilarious joke?	You don't even know the rules! This could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!
Hand ball! Direct kick!	I'm in Denmark!
Thanks, honey. After what you said to me, I watched hours and hours of soccer. I almost saw a goal! But there were so many ads for Spanish cell phones...	Dad, I'm impressed! You've become a much better referee.
I said foul on twenty-three!	I'm a spectator addressing a player, answer me!
Well I'm throwing you both out of the game!	"Helen, please. Don't drop the ""J"" bomb."
Foul on the other girl. Lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!	Ow! She tripped me. Ow! Owww!
She has not! Your daughter's a dirty player!	That is an outrage! Your daughter's been floppin' all day!
I don't need a soccer lecture from a hillbilly!	Sir, I have sired a dum-dum, a mush-head, a what'sit, a dog boy, and somethin' with a human face and fish body what we called Kevin. But my young'uns is not dirty players!
Ronaldo?! Winner of two World Cups and three FIFA player of the year awards?	How about a lecture from me -- Ronaldo?
Yellow card!	You heard Geraldo. What's it gonna be?
When I put on these shorts, I'm not your father anymore. And judging by how tight they are, I'm never gonna be anyone else's either.	You can't give me a yellow card?! You're my father!
Un-sportsman-like conduct.	This is what I think of your yellow card!
That's a red card. You're out of the game!	Un-sportsman-like conduct.
Lisa, sweetie, I was just following the rules.	It was just a game. A game I used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
Son, I'll never understand women if I live to be forty.	Yeah, in Idaho.
You said it -- enjoy me while I last.	Big if!
Wanna watch me?	Wanna go slam a few beers?
Lisa's mad at me and Marge is mad at him.	What'sa matter, Homer and Bart?
Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?	Gee Moe, you give great advice.
It's a documentary... by the B.B.C... in cooperation with Canal Plus...	Not interested.
Sweetie, are you here to forgive me?	Haw-haw.
But to get that DVD I had to become a PBS subscriber! Now I'm paying for crap like American Masters!	No.
Those places are pretty terrible.	You were right to kick me out of that game. Soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of Europe and South America.
I sure do.	Do you want to play a little?
Look what I can do!	Whatever. I'm gonna go play outside.
Oh, that's long gone, baby. Long gone.	Homer, what took you so long? The game's almost over.
I got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world.	Oh, that's long gone, baby. Long gone.
No more lazy Saturdays for you.	I got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world.
My son caught the ball! This makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!	I hogged it! I hogged it!
"I hate shopping. I'm bored, my feet hurt, I'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""	Not at all!
There must be another chair.	Unless you're serving me a cold beer, you keep moving.
I guess I could just sit on a bed...	"Uh-uh. My wife's lookin' for a bathing suit that doesn't make her look ""horsey"". So, I'm gonna be here a while."
Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.	Wow, this is soft...
Sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.	Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.
How many?!	What in the name of-- Hey, you!
Well, who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this? It works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs.	Are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?
I don't work here.	That's the best endorsement I've heard since Mickey Mantle for Maypo! I'll take five mattresses.
Woo hoo!	You do now, son! You're hired!
But it did happen. Just yesterday, in Crazytown.	All this fuss for a baseball game? Why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
Knock it off! He's just a kid!	I put on fresh makeup for this?
Hey, get off my case! He's the choke artist!	Aw, hey that's the guy what created him! If Homer had used some protection, we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!
Marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago.	Was there even a baseball game yesterday? I don't remember!
Oh yeah, let's see where that goes.	Don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
Let me tell you about a land where it rains beer and hails pretzels, and you can play swim-up blackjack with Abraham Lincoln! It's the land of sleep. And your passport: a simple mattress.	Oh yeah, let's see where that goes.
A common problem. Try this.	Yes, I need to be able to sleep through my wife's nagging, and my eight horrible babies and the anguished howls of my ancestors.
Sex problem, eh?	Homer, we have a friend -- actually, a friend of a friend--
Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. And I've got the answer to your problems -- the Snugulux, by Matrimonium!	Homer, please! They can hear you in fine china!
And remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. Okay, who else is dead in bed?	Oooh, sold!
The Lovejoys?! If this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you I had had like a million Doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!	Boo. Boo, indeed.
What's wrong with it?	We're here about the mattress.
Oh, I think I know what you're doing wrong. Have you tried...	We tried raising Cain but we weren't able.
I'll write you a check.	I know the mechanics of lovemaking, Homer! You owe us a refund!
Pay to the order of... Stupid Reverend... memo: bite my ass ... Wha?!	I'll write you a check.
On one condition: you do the shlepping.	If you let us have your mattress, we'll give you ours.
Move over just a...	Well, I'll have to check with my wife.
Wrong, wrong, wrong!	Well, maybe if you go...
Yeah... something has changed, but I can't figure out what. Our mattress! I traded it to the Lovejoys!	I'm sorry, Homie -- I want to snuggle, but I'm just not feeling it.
It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky.	You traded our mattress? I had my secret cash in it!
I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...	It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky.
Lousy Reverend. He's having my sex! While I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.	EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY, YAY, YAY... YAY!
Look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here.	I'm starting to feel funny about doing this.
Sorry.	Homer, stop that.
Well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover.	How dare you break into our house, defile our bed, and smash our family photos with your foot.
You would be.	Well, I am reminded of the story of wise King Solomon.
Or a chicken club... or a Reuben... or a Monte Cristo... or a... Pull over behind that billboard!	I wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
It's like our honeymoon all over again. Aw, we even have the same bum looking at us.	You really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?
"I couldn't find Maggie's brand, but I got every other kind I could find. How about ""Syntho-Nip?"""	Where's your father with those pacifiers?

"Good work, boy. Just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""	Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt?
Stupid baby... growing her brain... on my dime!	"Good work, boy. Just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
Mm-hm.	Are you counting sheep all night long?
It's not working! You lousy, worthless piece of--	Okay Nappien, do your stuff.
What a wonderful night's sleep. Thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as Nappien.	It's not working! You lousy, worthless piece of--
That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads.	Homer, I think you dominoed this.
How is that possible?	It was you.
Mood swings?! Mood swings. Mood swings!	"See? ""May cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."""
Mood swings? Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings, mood swings! Mood swings!	Mood swings?! Mood swings. Mood swings!
Nappien, you did it again! And everything is as it should be.	Mood swings? Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings, mood swings! Mood swings!
John Lennon?!	Nappien, you did it again! And everything is as it should be.
Yoko?	John Lennon?!
Well son, your Uncle Homer is, like eighty percent of America, whacked-out on prescription drugs.	Mr. Simpson, why did you hurt the dollies?
You're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.	But users are losers.
Because I'm filled with stress!	Why don't you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?
I have three kids and no money! Why can't I have no kids and three money?	Because I'm filled with stress!
Zombie kill.	Hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?
Zombie file grievance.	No, play!
Mm-hm.	Zombie file grievance.
Zombie montage:	And that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...
What the?! My car?! Milhouse?! Nutmeat?!	C'mon, just one more.
What are you, a travel agent? 'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip.	You've horribly injured the whole fire department!
I feel kinda responsible. Maybe I should volunteer to be a fireman.	Once again, crisis has brought out the best in us.
Oh, I can't wait for my first fire. Is that one?	Easy there, Fire Chief Moe.
Is that one?	That's just someone barbecuing.
I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.	Sweetheart, come to dinner.
Any moment...	I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.
Any moment...	Any moment...
Did I say any moment?	Any moment...
Any moment...	Did I say any moment?
What the hell is that?	Any moment...
Woo hoo!	That's the fire siren!
Marge, when you see me next I'll be a soggy, smoky hero. Mmm, soggy, smoky hero.	Woo hoo!
Don't tell me how to do my job!	Just come back alive, okay?
We don't get what?	Hey, this is sweet, huh? Almost makes up for not gettin' paid.
Burns stiffed us!	Of all the nerve.
Hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes.	Oooh, leather arms! People just give you this stuff?
I hope it's spaghetti!	"No, no, no, the complete ""Munsters"" on DVD!"
Lousy burns so ungrateful, I hate him so much...	I can't believe he acted completely in character.
Well... most of it.	Gentlemen, I'd like to thank you. You've saved my store.
And some stuff I wanted.	Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes...
Yeah, we're awesome. This'll make a great toilet seat!	Oh my, I didn't think the damage was that bad. But you must be telling the truth -- you're firemen, after all.
Just what are you getting at?	Uh, gentlemen... I'm uh... I'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here.
Oh, thank God there's a fire. Marge's birthday's comin' up.	You guys sure aren't making this easy.
Look at me! I'm a fireman!	Just let the chemicals deal with it.
Hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen Ionic Breeze.	Well, I guess every boy should see his father as a hero.
Oh, bogus gizmo, grant me eternal life.	Hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen Ionic Breeze.
Look at me, guys!	Well, uh...
I'm stealing five Segways at once! And speaking of segues, I'm off to my next morally questionable activity!	Look at me, guys!
We're not thieves, we're scavengers! Like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or America's sweetheart, the maggot.	You're nothing but a diabolical master thief. The kind that haunts the slopes of San Moritz or the casinos of Monte Carlo.
Make them stop!	You should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. Kids, get in here and show your father the faces!
Moe, can we talk?	You make them stop -- by doing the right thing.
Moe, I think we may have perverted...	Oh no, wait, it's only four ninety-five. What's on your mind?
Moe, I can save you but you have to let go of the clock.	This thing's hotter than Ellen Barkin!
So Daddy saved Apu and Moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson.	Let's hear it for Homer!
We sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.	What'd you do with all the loot?
Oh man, I love Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest!	Look at me, I'm the bum of the future!
You stuffed your horn?!	Styrofoam?
Where the hell is Abigail Adams?! Oh, there she is. Where the hell is Mary Todd Lincoln?! Oh, she's right there. Where the hell is Ida Saxton McKinley?! Oh I see. Where the hell is--	Ooh, look! Pine-cone first ladies!
"""Betcha can't solve our maze?"" I didn't come here to be insulted. We're leaving!"	Dad, look, a corn maze!
Sure is a lot of corn in this parking lot.	"""Betcha can't solve our maze?"" I didn't come here to be insulted. We're leaving!"
Split up?! Marge, no! We can fix this marriage!	Maybe we should split up.
Fine, you want out? Then go! I can make it on my own! Before I met you I had friends and dreams!	No, no, I didn't mean--
Oh please take me back. The dating scene is a nightmare. I'm begging you!	I was talking about--
Deep down, I... I guess I knew that.	I just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.
Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!	Now there must be a way out!
Hey, this maze is made of corn!	Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!
I'm so sick of being lost. To hell with maze etiquette! I'm walking straight outta here!	Hey, this maze is made of corn!
I'm lost and I'm starving!	That was never my plan.
I don't have any holders!	Eat some corn!
"""To my wife Marge -- in case I don't make it, here are my Oscar picks for next year: Best Sound Effects Editing, the team from--"""	This maze is too hard for me.
No. And never bring it up again.	Santa's Little Helper would be an awesome police dog! Can he, Dad? Can he?
All right.	Please, can he?
Now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! Look at him eyeing me -- he knows I taste best.	I can't believe it. My own dog bit me.
Oh relax, Marge, I'm just messin' with ya. I know I'm not a dog. I'm a people, like you.	Homer!
Cheer up, boy. We'll get you their most vicious street cur! He'll bite your ass raw!	I don't want a new dog. I want my old dog, the one who bit me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!	Oh, no problem, pally -- our pythons cost five dollars a foot.
Why you little... I'll teach you to trick your sister!	That's because I soaked him in slime!
Well, I can breathe out okay.	Homer, can you breathe?!
Don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants.	Well, I can breathe out okay.
I'm okay.	Don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants.
Hey, get your own yogurt!	Whoa, this is the source of the stench!
Woo-hoo! Business trip!	Simpson, you can take your putrid mess far out of my sight, you songless land-whale!
Apu, I'm returning a yogurt I wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with.	No, Jack, it's a joke name. You're being set up!
Hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!	What about the fat guy?
I'm still alive! You call that playing to win?!	I'm bulking up for football.
This is our life now, Milhouse. We're dumpster folk.	Dammit!
Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye.	Pink frosting fixes everything!
Ooh, it's that bar I like! Wait here in the car.	Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye.
Okay, Milhouse, what do you want to do?	Oh, sweet mother of Mary!
Ol' Betsy'll get us there.	Well, the school's having a bake sale.
Cops! Act natural!	So true.
Hello, Officer!	Cops! Act natural!
Rice Krispie Treats? Way to phone it in, Sarah Wiggum!	SKIP, SKIP, SKIP TO MY LOU...
Can I have some more money?	Raisin cake! Who wants raisin cake? Don't worry, it's not too moist!
All the other moms gave their husbands twenty.	I gave you ten dollars.
I had to fight! Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan, and I know he's not!	Well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
You butcher!	Once again, you have thoroughly misgauged my response. This is going on your permanent record.
Ooh, a thermos! With seven cups of coffee still in it! Oh wait, six!	Yes there is!
Here! It's yours!	Dad, that's a bomb!
Oh, I'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!	Oh, my special little guy. I'm so glad you're okay.
C'mon, everybody. Time for the family portrait. Let's bunch together now. Here we go.	It's okay. That was Shelbyville.
Move it!	C'mon, everybody. Time for the family portrait. Let's bunch together now. Here we go.
Perfecto. Everybody smile. I'm going to set the automatic timer.	Move it!
Almost ready! Here we go.	Perfecto. Everybody smile. I'm going to set the automatic timer.
Okay, here we go.	Yeah, Dad.
What'd you say?	Make room for Jumbo.
All right, everybody. Squeeze in real tight.	Nothing.
I wanna get us all in the picture this time. Closer.	All right, everybody. Squeeze in real tight.
Closer.	I wanna get us all in the picture this time. Closer.
Okay. Hold still. This is the last picture on the role.	Closer.
You watch your mouth you little Smartass.	Praise the Lord.
Nothing's gonna ruin this one. The timer's a tickin.	Yeah, Bart.
Bart!	Bart's makin' faces, Dad.
This one's gonna be the Simpsons at our finest.	Bart!
Smile. Look cheerful. Here we go...	This one's gonna be the Simpsons at our finest.
Here we go... Here we go.	Smile. Look cheerful. Here we go...
Why you little...	Here we go... Here we go.
Hey suckers, check it out. Marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery.	Oh Bart, you fall for that every six months.
"""Why the cemetery?"" I wondered. But my dreams were too strong."	You're going to the dentist too, Dad.
"Absolutely, all the time. I go to the floss store and they're like, ""Whoa, there he is again."" 'Cause I buy so much floss."	Mr. Simpson, have you been flossing regularly?
Oh God, my gums! They hurt so much!	Well let's just get started.
I know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth.	I haven't started yet.
I don't even have a special tooth problem! This is just a routine check-up! The bib is choking me!	Don't worry, sweetie -- I'm sure that man has some special tooth problem.
It's over? That wasn't so bad.	I don't even have a special tooth problem! This is just a routine check-up! The bib is choking me!
This is the greatest movie ever!	This film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. Mixed signals, hmm.
I have a right to my views.	Dad, that's ludicrous!
Sure do. Let's go get ice cream!	Don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?
I'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!	I can't wait to get the freshness out of my mouth!
"What the hell is a ""fundae""?"	Yay!
I like that. But I'm on a bit of a health kick, so I'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: Snickles, Gooey Bears, Charlottesville Chew, Nice 'N' Many, Kat Kit, Herschel's Smooches, Mrs. Bad Bar, and Milk Dudes.	It's a sundae that's fun.
Uh... cone!	Cup or cone?
Oh my God, this is amazing! Wait, I'm gonna be driving. I'll go for the cup.	Congratulations! You just purchased the one millionth ice-cream cone sold by this store!
Fine, cone.	Dad!
What's this?!	Fine, cone.
America West, please.	What's this?!
That's me!	Tonight on Smartline, a provocative discussion of the Middle East... will not be featured. Instead, we'll be talking to a man who bought an ice-cream cone.
I've never been to war, but I imagine it feels just like your first kill. The happiness swept me away!	All right, let's just get through this. Uh, Mr. Simpson, tell us how it felt when you bought the fateful treat.
Well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. That makes us friends, right?	No one saw my show... so no one heard my filthy faux pas! My career is safe!
Okay.	Uh... hey look, it's the airport bus. You should get on it.
The happiness swept me away!	And now to peruse the local news!
Oh.	Even the map thinks you stink, Kent!
Marge, the couch is lumpy!	Haw haw! Your distinguished career is over!
Kent Brockman!	That's because you're sitting on me, you lummox!
"I'm sorry Marge, but I won't live under the same roof as a member of the ""liberal media""."	I invited him to stay with us for a few days. His career is ruined, and I was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide.
Did you know that every day Mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?	You'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of Fox News.
Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!	We have to take in Mr. Brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
I'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. You can stay. But you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our Wall of Casual Acquaintances Who Came to Stay For A While.	And you're constantly flouting the law.
Apu sang a song. What are you gonna do?	I'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. You can stay. But you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our Wall of Casual Acquaintances Who Came to Stay For A While.
Liberals -- I hate them so much!	"It seems Liberals want to give NASA the right to ""abort"" space missions whenever they feel like it."
Woo hoo!	One thing I've always wondered: how can Fox News be so conservative, when the Fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? They don't fit together.
Liberals!	Liberals hate families...
Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals!	Liberals!
Woo--	Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals!
Hoo!	And swear like a lumberjack who hacked off a leg. Let's do it!
Woo hoo? Liberals? Woo hoo?	Hoo!
True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?	I guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
I know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. For years now, Fox has been--	Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!
I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. The truth is...	"...entertaining America with hits like ""House,"" ""American Idol"" and ""American Idol Results Show."""
Okay. What I was going to say, was...	I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. The truth is...
Hey, you're not a penny.	I guess this is the end. I just wish I'd spent more time at the office.
"""Me?"" But that's you!"	...me!
Uh-huh. See you at five then.	Got it!
Dinner with Mr. Burns! What a waste of my precious, precious Saturday night.	Uh-huh. See you at five then.
He is not my boyfriend!	Hey Dad, have fun with your boyfriend.
I do.	So Simpson, I hear you like pizza pie.
My favorite is Chicago deep dish.	I do.
Drive to Chicago? I don't have time for that. I have to be back at work on Monday. And my boss is a total jerk.	Chicago, eh? Well what if I took us there now?
A P-P-P-P-P-Private jet!	Who said anything about drive?
Yeah, but I'm on a plane, idiot.	/ Killer premise!
I'm aroused and confused.	And just so you know, she'll do anything for you. Anything except sex. And I do mean anything.
"Oh my God... Lionel Richie?! Can you sing ""Say You Say me,"" but make it about beer?"	Now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of Mr. Lionel Richie.
"Now make every word ""beer."""	Sure, I guess. HEY YOU, BEER ME / BEER ME FOR ALWAYS, THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE / HEY YOU, BEER ME / BEER US TOGETHER, NATURALLY
BEER BEER, BEER BEER / BEER BEER BEER BEER BEER...	"Now make every word ""beer."""
Um, wait, I forgot the words.	BEER BEER, BEER BEER / BEER BEER BEER BEER BEER...
No! If I leave the plane, I'll be just like everyone else!	Love you.
I wanna be back on the plane.	Ground control, this is November five four three Charlie. We're gonna need the extractor.
Svetlana! Svetlana!	We'll be back before you know it.
I came to relax -- you think of it!	Now I need a location.
Drunk!	Finally, an emotion.
I'm so happy!	While you were here, we felt like New York!
No way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! I flew on a private plane.	Homer, you smell like Chicago. Did you fly there on a commercial airline?
Please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.	Wow. Is it much different from a normal plane?
I had it all for one night. Now for the rest of my life I'll know what I'm missing. And all I have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again.	Homie, what's wrong?
"""High?"" High like a private plane? The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again."	Hi, Dad.
A fresh face!	That's where you're wrong, Homer.
"No way. I don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or ""guru""."	This is Colby Krause. I hired him to help you improve your life. He'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
Oh, tell me more!	I'm a life coach.
If you're gonna film me, I insist on a body double.	The first step in self-improvement is to take a thorough look at your life.
The camera's not on yet, right?	Is Uncle Fester still alive?
Okay. Uh... well uh... hm, I just uh. I forget what I do.	Okay, now I just want you to do what you normally do.
Wait, wait. Uh, this is some of what I do, I think. Sometimes I go places.	Okay. Uh... well uh... hm, I just uh. I forget what I do.
This is our relish tray. I'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.	Wait, wait. Uh, this is some of what I do, I think. Sometimes I go places.
What's the point of putting my socks on? I just have to take them off again a week later.	This is our relish tray. I'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.
Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch.	Homer, before you even head out the door in the morning, you're already a loser.
Think positive. Think positive.	Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch.
You were saying...	Think positive. Think positive.
Will you shut up? I can't hear the song in my head!	Homer, your journey downstairs would've been a lot safer if you'd remembered the N.D.C.'s of concentration: Never Don't Concentrate.
I've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say I suck. But it's no use -- I'm a hopeless loser and always will be.	Here's an important tip: stop doing that.
This I can do!	Homer, you're up!
Behold my two-seventeen average... and weep!	This I can do!
As I said, I've lost all hope.	Behold my two-seventeen average... and weep!
Is this going somewhere?	Homer, here in the bowling alley, you're a totally different man: relaxed, confident...
Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman, you're a genius!	I want you to wear those bowling shoes out the door and everywhere you go. It's crazy, but it just might work.
I wasn't talking to you.	That's not my name.
How many of those have private planes?	Homer, your shoe attitude is bowling people over. These are letters from companies interested in interviewing you!
Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing?	This one.
I'm gettin' that job. Bart, I'll need some clean urine. Stat.	They need a safety inspector to fly between their North American plants.
Well, I can see the position of handsomest C.E.O. is already taken.	You here for the safety inspector job?
I got the job!	I like you already. If you can write your name so I can read it, you're in.
I'm gonna get there early, so I can get in good with the lunch truck guy.	We're all so proud of you, sweetie.
Uh, yeah -- I have no job and nowhere to go. What do I have to buy so I can sit here all day?	An opera star!
One small coffee, please. And a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it.	Well, with a coffee you can stay till lunch. Then you have to order a solid.
Somebody's gotta do 'em.	They're all the same maze.
Look happy.	Somebody's gotta do 'em.
Oh, it was great! Flew to Tulsa on the company jet. Did my job in a way consistent with what I already told you. Because that's what you do. When you have a job.	So, how was your first day at your new job?
Stop peppering me with questions!	I'm so proud of you, Dad!
Well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... I lied. I didn't get the job. You see when I got there...	Why aren't you at your new job?
"So she said that's not my ""in box"" and he said that's not the Johnson Report!"	Well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... I lied. I didn't get the job. You see when I got there...
"Um... um...c'mon, say ""you're hired""!"	You sure know how to repeat the joke I just told ya. But as a formality I must ask: do you know anything about copper tubing?
Say it!	No.
Say it!	Leave your resume with Cheryl!
"Stop saying ""security""!"	Security! Security!
I couldn't bear to tell your mother, so I hang out here all day.	C'mon, just gimme the...
"Brands like ""Miser's Choice"" and ""Day-Old Delights?"""	But Dad, you've gotta tell her. She's been buying brand-name groceries.
Honey, there's something I have to tell you...	Hello?
No, it's, uh... good news!	It's bad news, isn't it? I should never get my hopes up. Nothing ever works out for us.
We're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. The company wants you and me to take the private plane to New York for the premiere! So meet me at Shelbyville Airport in an hour.	Really?
If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad.	We're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. The company wants you and me to take the private plane to New York for the premiere! So meet me at Shelbyville Airport in an hour.
Okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with Marge then maybe eat a devilled egg.	If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad.
Yeah, uh... semper fudge!	Well, anything for a fellow marine.
No, I said the right thing.	"Uh, did you just say ""semper fudge""?"
Honey... don't try to remember the whole day. Just what you're feeling this second.	Look at this business center -- fax, Wi-Fi, teleconferencing capabilities... I'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!
Marge... I've gotta be honest...	Sweetheart, what do you mean?
I don't know. Maybe we flew through a rainbow.	What was that?
I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?	Homie, what are you doing? You don't know how to fly!
Hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?	I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?
I'm trying to land a plane with no experience.	All right, Homer. What is it you're attempting to do? Win over a difficult client?
Duke? That's good.	Homer, I've gotta tell you, I'm not very good. I went to the Harvard of the South.
Vanderbilt?	Not Duke.
What? I'll show him. I'll show that guy!	Okay, Homer. I don't know anything about planes, but I know about you. You have what made America great: no understanding of the limits of your power, and a complete lack of concern for what anyone thinks of you. So you'll land that plane. And do you know why? Because I heard some guy say you couldn't.
And now, to taxi to the terminal.	Homer, you did it! You landed a jet!
Marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. That's why I've decided to go to the plant and beg Mr. Burns for my old job back.	Oh yes, of course.
You'd think so, but no.	And at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
So long, suckers!	This concludes our service. Go now in the peace of the Lord.
Move it! Move it! Move it! Do you want to be second out of the parking lot? Do you?	So long, suckers!
Leave her!	Move it! Move it! Move it! Do you want to be second out of the parking lot? Do you?
You'll never catch me, Lord!	We left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
Oh man, that church service was so boring. I did a whole book of Find-A-Words.	You'll never catch me, Lord!
Those are words.	"Dad, all you circled were the ""I's"" and ""A's""."
I wanna say one.	Bodacious Frittatas? Buffet the Hunger Slayer?
Denny's.	Be my guest.
Don't worry, we'll just go home. Your mother can cook.	Every place has such a long line.
Woo hoo!	There's a place -- with no line!
Lisa's right, son. Your Mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--	Bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house.
Dude! You don't think you know me, but you do!	Hi... you!
Mmmm, au jus! Not quite gravy, not quite blood...	Oh Homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus.
Oh, I can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!	It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
Come on, we're leaving! Mmm, after one more mini-quiche...	Um, listen, I'm outta town next week, so...
Will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?	Excuse me. My brother twisted his ankle setting up the chairs.
Of course.	Would you like to be a pallbearer?
I thought she said polar bear.	Of course.
My back! It hurts, and not in a good way!	Please sir, a little respect for the dead.
Stop that! I'm down here!	Well, time to move on with our lives.
Well, you're always telling me I should eat more dirt.	Homer, you have a mild back sprain. And you also ingested a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.
Which grow in what?	Not dirt -- vegetables!
My pleasure. IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU / IT WOULDN'T BE IN SUMMER. / SEEING YOU IN SUMMER I NEVER WOULD GO...	You know, Homer, your singing could help alleviate patient suffering, and save us a fortune in Demerol.
YOUR HAIR STREAKED WITH SUN-LIGHT /	My pleasure. IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU / IT WOULDN'T BE IN SUMMER. / SEEING YOU IN SUMMER I NEVER WOULD GO...
YOUR LIPS RED AS FLAME, / YOUR FACE WITH A LUSTER / THAT PUTS GOLD TO SHAME!	YOUR HAIR STREAKED WITH SUN-LIGHT /
BUT IF I'D EVER LEAVE YOU, / IT COULDN'T BE IN AUTUMN. / HOW I'D LEAVE IN AUTUMN I NEVER WILL KNOW...	YOUR LIPS RED AS FLAME, / YOUR FACE WITH A LUSTER / THAT PUTS GOLD TO SHAME!
AND COULD I LEAVE YOU / RUNNING MERRILY THROUGH THE SNOW?	Well, young people are my future.
KNOWING HOW IN SPRING I'M BEWITCHED BY YOU SO?	That beautiful voice! It's making my heart race!
OH, NO! NOT IN SPRING-TIME! / SUMMER, WINTER OR FALL! NO, NEVER COULD I LEAVE YOU AT ALL!	To the Betty and Herbert Weinstein Pavilion!
But I can only sing lying on my back.	The Springfield Opera House, of which I am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing La Bohème. I want you to sing the lead.
Oh, oh, I just have one question: what is this movie about?	Places, everyone!
"Excuse me, ""film."""	For the last time, it's not a movie!
HO DANNEGGIATO IL MIO PIEDE!	RODOLFO, PERCHÈ SIETE CHE VI TROVATE GIÙ?
NEI CIELI BIGI GUARDO FUMAR DAI MILLE COMIGNOLI PARIGI.	HO DANNEGGIATO IL MIO PIEDE!
MIMI!	Yeah. But these seats are terrible.
MIMI!	MIMI!
Woo-hoo!	My boy, you are a star!
Well I didn't mean to!	And you contributed to our culture!
Oh, good. This makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance.	No, no. It's a good thing.
Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future.	The dance isn't till next week.
AND THE HOME OF THE BRA-A-AVE!	Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future.
Wow, praise from Placido Domingo.	Nice set, Homer. That was a hot one.
Eh, I'll think about it.	Call me P-Dingo.
Thanks! You know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! No wait, I forgot about that other guy. Sorry, you're third.	You know, Homer, there's one thing about opera that has always bugged me: everyone sings instead of talking. But you made me believe I was in a magical world where singing is talking.
Hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor...	Wait, Homer, before you go, there's this new note I'm working on. Tell me what you think...
Keep reachin' for the stars, kid.	Like this...?
But I need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. Would you have me keep it fake?	You know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage.
My pleasure.	Would you mind signing autographs for my mother and me?
To the hottest girls in the room.	My pleasure.
I said you look hot! Hot! Ay Chihuahua!	What is he saying?
Hua-hua!	Ay chi-what?
No problem.	I want you to stop flirting with women.
And may I say I'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?	Sir, may I say I thoroughly enjoyed your performance.
What? That's how guys talk.	And may I say I'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?
You guys go on, we're gonna walk home.	Want us to take Marge shopping?
Marge, when I'm onstage I can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. So in a way, my groupies are really our groupies.	Now we both know that ain't gonna happen. But uh, I'm right here.
Not me, they love me.	We're trapped. Your fans will rip us to pieces.
Die, you stupid cobra, die!	Get on.
A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?	That's right, I'm a woman!
"So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang ""Uh-oh Spaghetti-os"". I'm hoping they send me a case."	That's a great idea! To celebrate, I'll go whip us up some Chex Mix pie.
Marge!	Now listen, Homer. You can have me any time you want me.
Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here.	What is it, sweetie?
Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out.	She's perfect! For the first time since you became an opera star I can finally relax.
That's it! Let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to Marge and you can never, ever have it. This opera's over when the fat man sings.	Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out.
That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left.	All right, Homer. I understand perfectly. You shall never be mine.
Julia, wait!	That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left.
Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? But make sure she's not crazy like you.	Yes?
Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol.	Dad, I think someone's trying to kill you!
D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH / WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO HOO / STU STU STU STU-PID FLANDERS...	Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol.
GET LOST, YOU WASTE OF A MOUSTACHE!	Why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?
Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular.	Let's go, Hagliacci -- or should I say, Madame Butterface! What? What? I had two.
And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.	Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular.
Singing opera made me good at painting.	And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.
YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WANNA	Come on, sweetie. Everyone's going to sleep.
THROW MY HANDS UP AND	Shout!
KICK MY HEELS UP AND	Shout!
HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!	Shout!
A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!	HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!	A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!
No problem.	Maggie's so clingy! Homer, hold her while I pour the milk!
My, you've grown.	No problem.
All over the floor.	Spilled milk?!
Hey Apu, what happened to all your milk?	All over the floor.
Does it work?	I sold it all to teenagers. There is a rumor you can mix milk, Mentos and Lotto scrapings to make jetpack fuel.
Hey Moe, got any milk?	Kinda.
It's paint. Or is it?	It's either milk... or paint.
Yeah, it's paint.	It's paint. Or is it?
I've gotta find milk somewhere!	What'd I miss?
At first I thought you were pointing to your crotch.	You want milk? I got yer milk right here!
That's my car!	Listen up, ya humps! Which one of yaz parked at the bank? 'Cause they're towin' yer sorry ass.
Aw, please, give me a break. I've been driving all night looking for milk for my kids.	This don't mean nothin'.
Okay. Let me just grab my registration.	I'll tell you what. I'll give you a ride to the impound lot.
I can't believe your boss lets you listen to rock music while you work.	Okay. Let me just grab my registration.
Wow, I'd really like to meet this guy.	I don't think my boss has a problem with anything I do.
But it's just you and me... That must mean I'm your boss. I'm sick of you! You're fired!	Well, he's in this truck right now.
Shut up! When you call in sick, who do you call?	No, ya Dumb Dominic. I'm my own boss.
Sometimes you want to work?	I don't call in sick -- I work when I want to.
Street cattle?	...and lasso the street cattle.
I think it goes here.	Street cattle?
Some of those were pretty funny.	The cars I tow. I got all kinds a names for 'em: She-atas, Hebrew canoes, spam cans, Swedish speedballs, and of course, stretch lame-os.
Wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. Just like God.	My blow better still be in the glove box.
Man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!	Wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. Just like God.
I would love to! But I don't have a tow truck.	You know... if you're interested... we could use another hook jockey. The Springfield territory's wide open, since Flatbed Fred got killed in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.
I'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.	For five hundred bucks, I'll sell ya this old bucket.
Uh, that's still too sexy for my wife.	Not to worry. These are the ones you show at home.
Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life.	No problem.
"...which I previously alluded... Are there two ""l's"" in ""alluded""?"	One, stick to Springfield. If I catch you on my turf, I'll rip off your head, vomit down your neck, pull out your heart, show it to your head, then shove 'em both down your neck hole, to which I previously alluded.
Why? What happens if I point it this way?	Rule two, always keep your hook pointed out.
Ah, my first tow.	/ Oh, spoil sport. / Oh, You're no fun!
Ah, my first tow.	Ah, my first tow.
Really? What's your handicap?	Stop! Stop! I'm entitled to park there.
I'm doing my job!	What the Hell are you doinG?!
You're hovering over a hydrant!	I'm doing my job!
I'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.	Huh?
Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.	With those jerks out of the way, I was able to park right outside!
Marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end.	Homer, where have you been?
Hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be.	I don't want to live like that.
Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principal's car.	Well, no one's disputing that.
It's Homer, idiot.	Top of the mornin', Tow-mer!
I guess I'm more powerful than God now.	So it is! I'm just here to pay the fine for the Sunday School bus. You towed it with the kids still in it!
Who said that? I'll kill them with my power!	"You know what they say: ""With great power comes great responsibility."""
If my life as a tow truck driver were a teleplay, this would be the end of act two.	Oh my God... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...
What? I'm still in Springfield.	I told you to stay off my turf!
Okay, I made a mistake. Why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?	What? I'm still in Springfield.
Put me down, you lousy-- Wheeee! Okay, I'm warning you-- Wheeee! I'll kill you, you son of a-- Wheeee! All right buddy, that's it, I've had-- Whee--!	Okay, I made a mistake. Why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?
Ooh, a trap door. What's down there? Your meatball collection?	You... let... go...
I thought we were friends! I was kidding you in a friendly fashion!	Goodbye.
Who are you guys?	I thought we were friends! I was kidding you in a friendly fashion!
Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?	We're just like you -- tow truck drivers who got greedy.
Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid. It's number two, right?	The truth is, we're just waiting for each others' hair to grow so we can braid it.
Do not worry. I am working.	Dad? Where are you?
Ask no questions. And do not call the police, or I will kill me.	Working? Where?
All is well. Goodbye forever.	You sound weird.
And all the Transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. The end.	I need a camera battery!
Okay, we've got time for one more.	Oh, that's great. / Great story...
Once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named Shrek Three. He lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times...	Homer, you do know what tomorrow is.
Maggie!	And if elected president of our small community, I will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay.
We're free!	Maggie!
Maggie! You did all this?!	We're free!
And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose.	Maggie! You did all this?!
Here's your nose. Daddy's putting back your nose.	And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose.
Thanks to her!	Homie! You're all right!
Wow, Bart! Lookin' good!	Are you sure? Hugs are dru--
Right... tomorrow.	Well, I have to look good for tomorrow.
Think. Think.	Right... tomorrow.
You have to think, it's your job!	Think. Think.
Why you little...	You have to think, it's your job!
What?! Name twelve.	You have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
American sober or Irish sober?	Homer, you cannot miss Lisa's big day. And you have to come sober!
Point one five.	Point zero eight sober.
Point one oh with a stomach full of bread. My final offer.	Point zero nine.
Goodnight, sweetheart.	Deal.
I'm gonna make it! I'll be on time for Lisa's thing!	Can't be late for Lisa's big day...
Ooo, an awesome accident! Easy, easy... I'll just take three seconds to gawk. Aw, everyone's okay.	I'm gonna make it! I'll be on time for Lisa's thing!
Gonna make it! Gonna make it!	Ooo, an awesome accident! Easy, easy... I'll just take three seconds to gawk. Aw, everyone's okay.
Woo hoo!	Gonna make it! Gonna make it!
Hmmm. Well, Marge, who's the unfit parent now?	Woo hoo!
"An hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. With my free time I can finally work on my ""Superman"" novel."	Hmmm. Well, Marge, who's the unfit parent now?
"""Make way for Superman,"" said Superman as he punched everyone at the Coffee Bean. Chapter Two..."""	"An hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. With my free time I can finally work on my ""Superman"" novel."
Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No.	And now the reason we're all here today... Lisa Simpson!
What?! Oh my God, my sweet Margie! Okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero.	Homer! I'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
Chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!	Worse than Scuzzo, Scummo, Oopsie, Carlos Mencia, Stinko, Blumpy... even worse than Sergeant Serious! How could I do worse than him?! I stole all his jokes!
Oh Marge, I was afraid I was going to lose you! Ohhh! Now let me help you make your slow transition back to society.	Okay. I'll visit you, Dwight.
You have a new home now... with us.	I just want to go home.
You don't owe him anything. Moe was in the hospital for three weeks and I didn't visit him once.	You're disgracing America's pastime. You should be ashamed of yourself... what the...?
Moe the tavern, not Moe the person.	You said you visited him every night.
Hey Marge, look at us -- the four amigos! They're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside.	Dwight, that was the most unselfish thing I've ever seen. I'm sorry I didn't visit you before.
The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you.	You see, the problem is, we've grown apart.
Why does he always bring up my weight?	Greetings, Two Forty-One.
Don't worry, sir. I'll handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart!	I want you to eliminate this reporter: Kent Brockman. He found the gully where I dump electricity every summer to jack up prices.
Marge, I'm gonna be home late tonight. I'm going to... Midnight Monkey Madness at the zoo.	What?
Have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.	Well I won't be home either. I'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains.
Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself.	Ninth floor -- assassin's perch.
Out of my way, mystery skank!	Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself.
Hey! Now I don't get paid!	Out of my way, mystery skank!
Now I'm mad!	Hey baby! / How ya doin'?! / Hello!
Now I'm .	Now I'm mad!
Marge is a professional assassin!	Now I'm .
Hey, what's that?	You just can't get Russian gangster blood out. Must be something they eat.
Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing.	How was your night?
Seconds, please.	"Homie, I made you my ""killer"" lasagna."
I'll kill her after dessert!	Seconds, please.
You ruined that pie!	You're a killer for hire!
How could you not tell me?	How could you not tell me you were an assassin?
Well, they're not as pretty as you, Marge.	I told you twenty times! You never listen!
Okay, here's the deal, I'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids.	Listen, I...
I just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.	I get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
I was out getting drunk, then killing people!	All those nights I thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!
Why do you think I'm kicking it?	Stop it! That's my favorite couch!
Hey, who wants ice cream in bed?	It sounded like you were.
At your funeral.	"Great. Now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will ""super dad"" be then?"
Oh, that was so hot! I love watching you do other guys!	I would have taken a bribe!
That can be arranged.	I'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom.	Oh, what a wonderful night.
Crème brûlée! Crème brûlée! Or in English: Burnt Cream! Burnt Cream!	That's terrific, but I called you here to discuss your son's misbehavior on the school bus.
Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes.	WE'LL BE KILLING EVERY HUMAN IN TWO DAYS / WE'LL BE KILLING EVERY HUMAN IN TWO DAYS / WE WILL COOK THEM / WE WILL EAT THEM / 'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY TO TREAT THEM...
How about a little neck rub, baby?	Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes.
Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt...	How about a little neck rub, baby?
Oh Marge, your tentacles feel so good. Wait a minute... why am I getting words in edgewise?	Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt...
Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy.	Kodos the Destroyer!
Who is it?	Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy.
Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!	Open this door at once!
Can I help you, gentlemen?	Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!
Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here in the living room.	We know it's you, Mr. Simpson. Now where's the alien?
Homer -- bored!	Bart... friend?
Quiet -- we're missing the dissection!	Definitely -- especially if you count the inside flap as part of the cover. It usually gives you a great idea of what the book's about.
No one likes a know-it-all.	Actually, I'm still alive, so technically it's vivisection.
Oh, lighten up. It's Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment.	Excuse me, but this is not good!
Hold still! I'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!	I've got something that will scare the H-E-double sippy straws out of them.
Hm, I thought I was killed by that magic spaghetti!	Sloth!
Okay Maggie, just calmly and carefully back away.	There's a bee on Maggie!
Beehive!	Okay Maggie, just calmly and carefully back away.
Blueberries!	Beehive!
Way to go! Many happy returns.	Cool.
There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?	Homer! The wedding's in twenty minutes! Just pick a tie!
The cornerstones of the Brewish faith.	There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?
And what color would that be?	Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
Of course I know!	You don't know what color my eyes are?
Uh...	No peeking. I'm wai-ting.
"Is ""beautiful"" a color?"	You really don't know, do you?
Marge, give me a break! I don't notice the color of people's eyes! I just judge them on the color of their skin.	No.
She's wearing white? She must have rolled the odometer back to zero.	Fine. Since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
Spaz.	Little help?
...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms.	"Why does every kid who stays with us bring ""mommy meals""? So I put pineapple in my potato salad. Live a little, huh!"
Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me.	But why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
Sleep tight. The Container Store now has five convenient locations!	Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me.
And we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.	And until they do, you can stay here.
Hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of Ocean Spray? Oh boy -- forget that. How about some... Cap'n Crunch? Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing? No, no! Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna? Billy Ocean CD? The history of Atlantic Records?	Who is it?
I want to, but I can't!	Stop naming things!
Good idea. I'll drown my sorrows in Anchor Steam Beer! Oh, I'm sorry!	Then go to Moe's!
Where is it?	I can't be a baby anymore. I'm alone now. I have to be a man! Thanks, Mags.
I gotta find out what color Marge's eyes are.	Where is it?
Cha-ching!	I gotta find out what color Marge's eyes are.
Oh Marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?	Cha-ching!
Boy, stop talking to yourself!	If he could go back to being happy, I could go back to being cool.
Your thoughts should stay in your head! Heh, heh, I sure told him. Now, what am I gonna do about Marge?	Boy, stop talking to yourself!
Oh, I'll never remember what color Marge's eyes are!	Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Brown? No. Orange? No. Elm? Rake? Guessing?	Oh, I'll never remember what color Marge's eyes are!
A song? Wait, it's coming back to me.	Well, well, look who's strollin' down Alzheimer Avenue. You used to know everything about that wife of yours. Even wrote a song about her.
THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL HAIR / A BLUE BOUFFANT FROM HERE TO THERE	A song? Wait, it's coming back to me.
SNOW WHITE TEETH AND LIPS SO RED / SHE'S THE WILMA TO MY FRED	THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL HAIR / A BLUE BOUFFANT FROM HERE TO THERE
OH THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL... EYES	SNOW WHITE TEETH AND LIPS SO RED / SHE'S THE WILMA TO MY FRED
/ WHEN HAPPY THEY SPARKLE, WHEN SAD THEY CRIES	OH THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL... EYES
/ THOSE EYES ARE GEMS BEYOND APPRAISAL / STUNNING SHADE OF PUREST... Oh, what is it?! I was so close! Let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! Oh, it's hopeless! She'll never love me again.	/ WHEN HAPPY THEY SPARKLE, WHEN SAD THEY CRIES
Hazel! Your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw I ate after we first made love.	Oh Homie, I'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me.
Mmm... porkpie.	"You're cool, you're not ""mainstream,"" you wear a porkpie hat..."
Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?	"""Rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame""."
We're gonna be rich! We can finally start a family!	Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?
A better one!	We have a family.
Oh yeah, Marge, I love these business trips of yours. The TV remote isn't nailed on. My whole life, I've never been in a hotel that trusted me.	You're getting a cuckoo clock! And you're getting a cuckoo clock! And you're getting a cuckoo clock! And you're getting a cuckoo clock!
Hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. Now I know why pimps are so happy.	Oh yeah, Marge, I love these business trips of yours. The TV remote isn't nailed on. My whole life, I've never been in a hotel that trusted me.
I hear that.	"Yep, nothing beats living on ""wife-support""."
Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!	Yo guys, come meet a new husband!
"Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Homer. My wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women."	Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!
I pay ten dollars a tube for those!	"My wife invented ""SkyPills."" She uh, mixed vitamins with Alka-Seltzer and pretended it was medicine."
Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get.	That's why I drive a Bentley.
Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.	And they're not talking about cars.
Marge won't dump me. I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.	Yes!
That will never happen!	Here's how you know she's really about to go: your wife seems happy and full of life.
Marge! Marge!	That will never happen!
A makeover!	Marge! Marge!
Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled.	A makeover!
Um, so... tell me about your day.	Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled.
I do! I do!	Oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day.
Hey, the networks have different channels in this city.	Well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed Mount Everest and got everyone else killed.
Are you happy and full of life?	That's okay. I don't care that you don't care. Go watch your thing.
Old one?! They're convincing Marge to dump me!	Really? But I'm so used to my old one.
You guys gotta help me! If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make.	I'm going to the successful ladies room!
What's your secret?	Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a secret. I'm a first husband. I used to look like this.
Uh-huh.	Oh, there's no secret. Just hard work...
Okay.	...exercise two hours a day...
Fashions.	...keep up with the latest fashions...
Uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. I know just what it'll take to hang onto Marge.	...and of course, cut out all fatty foods and alcohol.
Please, Doc. I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but I took care of my family, and that used to be enough. But not anymore.	It's a very, very serious operation. You should only undergo it as a last resort.
And I know how I can knock myself out. I'll look at your bill.	Very well. If you wish, we can perform the procedure in the office, today.
Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And--	Oh, get a life.
Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother.	Dad, are you okay? I see food on your plate instead of blurring motions.
No, I had my stomach stapled!	You had your hot dog plumped?
All food tastes like barf now.	No, I had my stomach stapled!
Welcome home, Marge.	Homie, I'm back!
A smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.	You remembered I like romance!
Do you like guys who are... attractive?	You also remembered I like flattery!
All for you, baby.	Homie, you look good!
Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front?	Let me get a good look at you!
Uh, it used to be.	What are you hiding from me? Is it chocolate?
Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now.	Whoa! Those buns are poppin' fresh!
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.	And I'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery!	Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?	You want me to unstaple your stomach?
Did someone order a super stud?	And so, to honor her success, I bestow upon Marge Simpson this hundred dollar gift card to Sweatpants Etcetera.
My implants feel itchy.	Did someone order a super stud?
You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.	Listen, Homer, I gotta be honest with you...
Noooo!	Okay.
Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.	The doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. And I said no. But I did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man I love.
I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it.	And Dad, I hope you learned something from this.
Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better.	Amen.
Aw...	Well, maybe I could. But every time I look at you, I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with.
Now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. We're just gonna get a camera battery and go home.	Oh no, wait. He's hangin' out with Derek Jeter.
No thanks -- just here for a battery.	Interested in a car stereo?
All I want is a battery.	Big special on camcorders!
Battery, battery, battery!	Care to make love, sir?
Hmm...	Battery, battery, battery!
No...	Hmm...
Bingo!	No...
One battery, please.	Bingo!
Sold! Sucker.	That'll be fifty cents -- or free, with the purchase of a $200 TiVO plus a two-year contract.
My what now?	Sir, your TiVO?
C'mon, Lisa! The TV's been off for five whole minutes!	My what now?
Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?	"I've gotten so much accomplished: I saved ""Lost"", watched all of ""Rome"" in a day, and got through ""Two and a Half Men"" in two and a half minutes. Then I ran out of space and had to choose between ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Schindler's List."""
Sometimes I think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.	Howdy, folks! Are you tired of family arguments over where to go to dinner?
Good luck, with my finicky appetite.	Why not try Wes Doobner's World Famous Family Style Rib Huts! The rib joint with something for everyone.
Sold!	We've got ribs...
THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA!	WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NIIIIIIIING... / BUT DON'T FILL UP ON BREAD!
More ribs for me!	That's odd -- there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
More ribs for me!	There aren't any tables or chairs.
More ribs for me?	I see no grill, oven, or food of any kind.
Finally, some service. Now listen. We wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- Michigan or better.	Hello, Simpsons.
Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can.	And now you're all going to die -- just because you watched a television commercial!
I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.	Before you die, perhaps you'd like to know how I engineered my ultimate revenge.
Mr. Doobner, I have a complaint: I work hard, and when I go out with my family, I expect a certain level of basic--	I'm Wes Doobner.
Nobody do it.	Shut up! This time, to liven up my tale, I brought along some visual aides. Just call me... Slideshow Bob!
Finally, the ribs.	"""The Hills Have Eyes Three: The Hills Still Have Eyes"". And now, the moment we've all been waiting for..."
Yet another new restaurant fails.	I shall.
He cheats at Uno!	He mocked my folksy ways!
Yeah, well, between you and me, I still can't stand him.	Well, I guess the rest of us should pay our respects.
I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him...	Yeah, well, between you and me, I still can't stand him.
I don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...	I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him...
Now?	Feet? Killing?! We gotta save Bart!
But I'm getting a home perm!	Now?
Uh-huh.	Bob planned this from the beginning --
Yes.	He wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
No.	He would never get a Shakespeare quote wrong --
Oh yeah!	His mother was a Shakespearean actress!
A doctor, huh?	His father is a doctor...
I remember.	...so when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...
Uh-huh.	...his father could take that opportunity to inject Bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.	It was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!
Hey, what smells so good?	Stop that cremation!
Eat hobo remains!	You're too late, Simpsons!
Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins.	Get me outta here. What are you doing? I can't breathe!
Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!	Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob is finally locked up for good.
No more drinking.	Wow, I must have really tied one on last night.
Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.	No more drinking.
Where's Marge?	Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.
Hey, kids! Have you seen your mother?	Where's Marge?
Or yourselves?	Hey, kids! Have you seen your mother?
Maggie? Has anyone seen anyone?! Oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. Without me!	Or yourselves?
Save some suds for--	Maggie? Has anyone seen anyone?! Oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. Without me!
Daddy...	Save some suds for--
Hey boy! Do you know where the family is? Show me on Mapquest.	Daddy...
"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it."	"Was you ever. You came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got... the ""Forget-Me-Shot."""
Mmm, pickle...	You start with a splash of Jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, Triple-Sec, Quadruple-Sec, gunk from a dog's eye, Absolut Pickle...
Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...	There was a domestic disturbance at your address yesterday.
Marge had a black eye?! I could never do something like that! Could I?	All right, door -- you're coming downtown.
Flanders!	Why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint? Not that I am authorized to release that infor--
The queen's private surgeonnn!	Fine, it was Flanders. Now since you know everything, who was Jack the Ripper?
What did I do?	I had to -- I heard a hubbub, Bub.
What happened in this room? If only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. And I could use that money to-- Hey, a memory!	I can't say for sure, but as a Christian, I assume the worst.
Dad, I can't remember what I did last night. Do you have any idea?	You'll eat our cookies but you won't look at us!
Your memory bubble and you.	Dad, I can't remember what I did last night. Do you have any idea?
I'm afraid I did something to make Marge and the kids leave me.	You come to me for help rememberin'? That's like asking your horse to do your taxes, which I did back in nineteen ninety-eight.
Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?	Wait, I know someone who can help ya -- a doctor who helps people dig up old memories.
Done.	Punch that orderly who takes sips out of my juice.
How 'bout The Deja Viewmaster?	Mr. Simpson, I have built a device that will enable you to explore your memories. The science was easy, but now I've got the hard part, coming up with a name.
Remembrance of things fast?	Uhh...
The Rememberererer?	Hmm...
This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!	Ah, my first Christmas. Such great Chinese food.
Bo-ring.	Now you'll feel a slight pinch... followed by an extremely painful pinch. Signaling that the spike will begin boring into your skull three seconds later.
Ow. Ow. Ow!!! Three, two, one. Owwwww!!!	Yes, that's right, boring.
What the hell?	Ow. Ow. Ow!!! Three, two, one. Owwwww!!!
"""This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life."" It's got that new bubble smell."	What the hell?
Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them.	"""This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life."" It's got that new bubble smell."
Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?	Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way.
I've gotta find out who that guy is, but I need help. Someone like Bart, only smart. Lisa!	Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?
Lisa, I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?	Another me? You can watch the kids.
Bring it on.	Yo, Homer! Can you take me to when you were ten to see if I can kick your butt?
Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer.	You're superior to me in every way!
I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!	What is it you want from me? Money? Weed?
Who was it with?	Dad, you just destroyed your first kiss.
Right.	Uh... Apu.
Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?	Right.
It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind.	Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?
Really? Then if I created all this... that means I can have pizza anytime I want!	It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind.
Hello, I'd like to order a pizza. Thirty-five minutes?!	Really? Then if I created all this... that means I can have pizza anytime I want!
See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?	Hey, what's going on here?!
What if you just moved the bottle?	See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?
All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.	What if you just moved the bottle?
How can I get my memory to work?	All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.
The mother of my children with the reason for my children!	Duffman!
Noooo!	I'm just givin' it to your wife. She is gonna be sore tomorrow.
Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!	Noooo!
My life is ruined.	My wife left me. I've done horrible things. My family's gone.
Goodbye, cruel world.	My life is ruined.
And goodbye, Cruller World.	Goodbye, cruel world.
Wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then I'm not gonna do it.	Good one.
A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.	My life's flashing before my eyes.
Hey, what's going on here?!	A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.
A surprise party?	Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way. We were planning a surprise party for you.
Are you kidding? The mother of my children with the reason for my children! This is gonna be the greatest party ever!	I'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
Oh my God! It's like Christmas in December! Let's celebrate now.	Oh yeah! Duff beer is sponsoring the party, featuring new Duff Champagne -- the beer of champagnes!
Don't worry honey, I'll get you an ice pack. Where's the ice pack?	My eye!
So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid.	Homer, we wanna get him away from Burns!
Oh, right.	So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid.
This is great! I must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.	Homie, this is your party!
What plan?	Geez, Homer, I can't believe your plan actually worked.
Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.	Your plan to make the surprise party a surprise again. Remember?
Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--	I've spit in every drink I ever served you. Bottoms up!
For the love of God, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce.	Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--
And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here.	Because I didn't want him finding out about the party. I mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring Sarah, and I just don't care for that woman.
Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.	This is good for two free drinks.
Oh yeah.	Because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee.
Who's an angry dog? Who's an angry dog?	Oh yeah.
No, this is a moment I want to remember.	Aren't you going to drink?
Oh no! He's talking to that mailroom guy.	We can't leave work till you do!
Now, back away from Burns and I will let your dog live.	Listen carefully. I have taken your wife hostage. If you don't have a wife, I have kidnapped your brother. Nod if you understand.
Good. Now stop and dance like a happy prospector.	Now, back away from Burns and I will let your dog live.
Happier!	Good. Now stop and dance like a happy prospector.
Happier!	Happier!
Happier!	Happier!
Oh right. Just leave! But kick like a Rockette!	Time to make our move.
Set the table, Marge!	Empty apartment here I come!
I can already taste those deep-fried pork chops!	Set the table, Marge!
When you ask me that it's never good.	Don't you remember what today is?
Marge, that was a joke!	I'm just really worried about your weight. Bart says that we got a call from NASA and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
I think I'll miss you most of all, Captain Corndog's Schnitzel Palace. No tears, Homer.	Well, if I'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap I love.
Uh-oh, can't let Marge see this.	I think I'll miss you most of all, Captain Corndog's Schnitzel Palace. No tears, Homer.
A drive-up trashcan!	Thank you!
This must be how the rich toss out their gold. And as long as I'm cleaning out the family chariot...	A drive-up trashcan!
Cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...	This must be how the rich toss out their gold. And as long as I'm cleaning out the family chariot...
"Hmm... ""Dispose of proper--"" This book is too hard."	Cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...
Now for a victory cigar.	"Hmm... ""Dispose of proper--"" This book is too hard."
I can't stand to see a grown burger cry. We must rebuild Fast Food Boulevard!	There, there, Cheesy McMayor. No one likes weepy meat.
I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where I can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. I say we rebuild the Fast-Food District -- bigger and better than ever!	I can't stand to see a grown burger cry. We must rebuild Fast Food Boulevard!
C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!	This election is on every channel.
Think tank, eh?	I think it's exciting -- Springfield is the center of the political universe. I feel like a pundit in a think tank!
Die Hard Two!	"But I was in ""Die Hard."""
I live in that place!	Opinions about the ads.
He's got my vote.	"Former governor Vincent Aleppo said in the New York Times, ""I will protect the nation from attack."""
Dear God. What have I done?	But in that same issue of the New York Times, they also printed an article about terrorist leader Nussaf Al Mustaffi.
Oh my God, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!	And ye shall judge them by the company they keep.
That was the best milkshake ad I've ever seen. It makes me want a milkshake!	I feel exactly the opposite but the same.
If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!	Stop all this pandering!
You too, Fred Thompson.	If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!
Is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as I am?	You too, Fred Thompson.
Why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?	What're we gonna do? We can't not vote. Nobody does that!
No, no. This candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous.	Sorry.
No. But you're close.	Chief Wiggum!
What I did made the TV thing happen.	Shockingly, this new face is now favored by fifty-three percent of likely voters. A new frontrunner has been crowned!
I dig the Wig! I dig the Wig!	Lisa, I'm sure this Wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter.
Lisa, being President is easy. You just point the army and shoot.	Ow!
Oh, the Patriot Act is so terrible! The government might find out what library books I take out. What's next -- finding out what operas I go to?	The Constitution? I'm pretty sure the Patriot Act killed it to ensure our freedoms.
Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm.	Dad, I'm freezing.
I thought global warming would take care of it. Al Gore can't do anything right.	We wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
Like which kid's their favorite! It's Lisa.	Hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets.
Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.	We're in every kind of therapy!
"Oh, it was a wonderful time. The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created ""Futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called ""Melrose Place""..."	The nineties? Never heard of it.
Your mother and I were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together.	"Oh, it was a wonderful time. The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created ""Futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called ""Melrose Place""..."
Like all young people, I had a musical dream.	We didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love.
A dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.	Like all young people, I had a musical dream.
But Marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.	Die! Die! Die!
I was so depressed, I spent all my time in a bar.	Whatever, Homer and I had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life...
I had finally realized every rock star's dream...	Ah. Continuing in that line of thought, may I kiss your mouth with my mouth?
...hating being famous.	I had finally realized every rock star's dream...
A tale of two young outlaws in love...	Oh Marge, it's statements like that that make people say women are stupid.
I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.	Homer really did need those injections.
With the nineties drawing to a close, and the Sydney Olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled...	I'm getting you off this stuff.
And one moonlit night, I finally had fun at a mini-golf course.	With the nineties drawing to a close, and the Sydney Olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled...
Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart.	Did you two ever get back together?
I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach.	Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart.
And once we were back together, I was too happy ever to grunge again.	Well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- Homie is where my heart is.
Good, 'cause I'm parking at it right now.	I can't wait to see my Valentine's Day surprise!
For the next two hours, we'll be kid free. It'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall.	You're right. But I'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, Britney Spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit.
Ah, the Tunnel of Love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy.	That was the best Christmas ever.
What if I told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?	This is a terrible Valentine's Day.
They were the Bonnie and Clyde of their day. Their names were... Bonnie and Clyde.	You'd think so, but...
Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. Why can't this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?	Ruh-roh.
Happy Valentine's Day, and shut your gob.	And I love you, Tootsie Roll...
Loa...ner?	While your car's in the shop, you can drive this loaner.
Wow. This is the kind of car you see in commercials! How much am I paying for this?	She's right here.
Hm, it seems like a lot...	Nothin'.
Really? You people are idiots! That's the dumb-- What a stu-- I mean, that sounds fair.	On the contrary. The loaner car is complimentary. It's standard policy.
Look at you! Idiots!	Okay, so--
DRIVER OF A LOANER CAR / MUCH BETTER THAN A / DRIVER OF MY NORMAL CAR...	Look at you! Idiots!
None.	Whoa, fancy wheels. What song does the horn play?
Wanna take a ride with your old man?	Cut it out!
C'mon. C'mon. Oh c'mon.	No.
Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to.	There's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. But since then, I've really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect can't be bought.	Really, Dad?
That's my boy! Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!	You're right. I'm gonna go to school tomorrow and show everyone I'm awesome.
Twister! Get down!	Now let's add the rear window defogger!
Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive? Our loaner awaits!	No, I'm kind of embarrassed about it.
Uh-huh.	Did you just unlock the car from here?
That wasn't us, that was the transmission.	Hello, you've reached the snug bug. What do you mean my car's ready?! Well you can keep it, 'cause I'm never giving up this one. Now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love.
Yeah, I can't believe all those years I used to drive that old piece of... What the?!	I never dreamed an American car designed in Germany, assembled in Mexico from parts made in Canada, could be so amazing.
My old car!	Yeah, I can't believe all those years I used to drive that old piece of... What the?!
So you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?	My old car!
Well, we're gonna start by shootin' her full of holes. And then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her.	Sure! Why, what did ya have in mind?
Sorry, Maggie.	Dad?
Just gimme a minute. But feel free to go nuts on me.	Jeez Louise. Are you okay?
Wait, what's that smell? It's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water.	Oh boy, dinner time! The perfect break between work and drunk.
But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.	It's your new diet!
I'll bet no man would touch you.	Homer, did you know I used to weigh four hundred pounds?
It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!	"Well, I went from fat to ""all that"" using my simple, foolproof diet. It's all about little substitutions. Instead of French toast for breakfast, why not eat a bell pepper? When you crave something sugary, eat a bell pepper. Want a beer? Bell pepper!"
Three please!	Bell peppers! Pipin' cold! Crunchy and bland!
Not quite.	Three please!
Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat.	You've gained seven pounds!
What?! I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.	Homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one.	Searching for evidence. I know your father's cheating on his diet.
Wrong again.	Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one.
Work.	That's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
I, uh, I have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass -- it's the law.	It's four o'clock on a Saturday.
I now declare you chips and salsa.	Hmmm.
Oh, hey, kids! Um... What's up?	I now declare you chips and salsa.
Nothing!	Nothing!
Mmm, lamb.	Nothing!
C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there.	I can't live with the guilt. I'm going to Martin's house... to end it all!
Listen, baby. The other night was great, but it can never happen again. Oh, who am I kidding? I have to see you right now!	C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there.
Pudding power activate!	Homer Jay Simpson!
Sweetheart, I didn't want to deceive you. I just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes.	Let him have it, Marge!
"I'm Lord Evilton from the ""Angelica Button"" books."	Bart, it's me!
C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it.	"Wait in line for a book? You tell 'em Bart says ""Hey""."
Move or die!	Okay, I'm gonna hand out colored bracelets. The color on your bracelet will determine--
But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m.	TV! TV! TV!
That's right. Now I'll cut and you soak.	Oh. Oh.
Go-go or boring?	I think you've got a point! Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!
I said secret.	You have a drinking problem?
Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?	I said secret.
Well wonder no more!	Gay out?
Thanks, son.	Dad... marinating with you is cool.
My Hindu friend, this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation.	I dan't dear dou!
Where's our jerky?	What the?!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You haven't seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?	You have wasted my time! You have made a very powerless enemy. Good day and be well!
Who could have done this?!	"You can skip the ""K"" and the ""Y"" -- I do not thank you and I will not come again."
This can only mean one thing.	Well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints...
Flanders! You ate my jerky!	This can only mean one thing.
I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!	"As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these Hardy Boys books."
You stay right here.	I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!
Yeah, that's it, don't be shy...	Puff with us! Puff with us! Puff with us!
Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits Homer Simpson... Hey, they're not sleepy. They're just turning fuzzy...	Yeah, that's it, don't be shy...
I thought this might happen, so I brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow.	Homer, you ate their jerky.
That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.	Dad, you never win a fight with animals. Remember when you lost that war with the worms?
You're on your own.	Dad! Dad, a little help?
When you cut 'em they multiply -- I can't fight that! Now let's take care of those raccoons.	You're on your own.
Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!	When you cut 'em they multiply -- I can't fight that! Now let's take care of those raccoons.
Enjoy your jerky, little critters, and one day you'll grow up to be people. Bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend.	Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!
Lisa!	I need firsthand smoke!
Gimme that!	Lisa!
I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.	Gimme that!
I can't believe you were smoking. Do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?	I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
And a very wise fish he is!	A sturgeon is a fish.
Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?	And a very wise fish he is!
Uh... are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?	Oh Homie, I've been so happy lately. I'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! Now what did you want to say to me?
Maybe you're drunk.	There's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. Look at me, I'm glowing!
Okay.	Homie, Lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy.
Fatherhood hurts my brain.	Okay.
Because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. But you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!	Fatherhood hurts my brain.
What'd you say?	That's easy for you to say. You've never had to be thin and focused.
I thought you might have trouble with this. That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. Someone you'd never expect.	I'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital.
Come on out, boy.	Is it Bart?
Wrong number.	Who was that?
Okay, Bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. Step one: we chuck the raccoon in there.	Five minutes, ladies.
Don't worry. I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.	What if someone catches him?
See? Now go, boy!	Don't worry. I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
Not keys, cigarettes!	See? Now go, boy!
Yeah, that's what I mean.	Not keys, cigarettes!
Hee-hee. Okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes...	For three boxes?
This is my favorite family tradition -- ice cream after a botched recital.	You'll never take down big ballet! Never! Now good day.
No!	Does that mean I can stop training to be a Mexican wrestler?
Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo.	No!
Come on, preen harder! Make them hate you! You feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!	Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo.
Dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?	No me gusto. Que lastima.
All right, that's it, pull over.	It's night?!
I was having the most wonderful dream. I always wake up just before the good part.	Dad... Dad? Wake up!
I'll see you later, honey.	You can just drop me off here.
Homer Simpson. I know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. And I'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together.	Order! Order!
Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news.	Oh, right. Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! But I forget how Mom felt about it...
I told her not to go into one of those.	Ms. Lumpkin owed fifty thousand dollars in back taxes. With penalties, interest and the celebrity resentment tax, that sum has grown to twelve million dollars. However, she's been missing for several years, since her career went into a downward spiral.
Don't worry, you can stay with us. I'm sure Marge will be cool.	Shh! I'm more wanted than the last petal on a bloomin' onion.
Confederate degenerate?	Listen, I'm sorry I called you all those mean things like, oh, I don't even remember...
Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks.	Sadly, no. Most of my money went to my ex-husbands.
How could a man just abandon his family? By which I mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?	So that's it. She's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
Where you going?	How could a man just abandon his family? By which I mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?
Wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a Dad too lazy to run away!	I made that hug happen!
And he has hair! Bart, get me my suicide axe.	Wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a Dad too lazy to run away!
Just sit still in my lap!	Aww, well, you don't need a t-shirt for that, Tootsie Pop. 'Cause I ain't ever gonna leave you again.
Why you little--	Yeah, all I see is a gut with knees!
Get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!	Why you little--
Lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. Why can't I leave for thirty years?	All right, I get it, I get it.
Well... it might be cold outside.	Fine with me. Look, I packed you a bag.
Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology. Well in that case I'm not going and I'm not staying. And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling.	No problem. I bought you a hat.
Song's over, Dad.	AND HERE COMES GRAMPA WITH AN OTTER!
"Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."	I'm really worried about Lurleen.
Marge, my fringes are knotted again.	Uh, yeah...
And remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and TV movies. Regular movies, don't hold your breath. But TV movies, the sky's the limit.	By the way, I'm Mary.
Ten percent Lycra.	Colonel, you're still my knight in white polyester.
Ooo, I think he's a keeper.	Babe, I need a hundred bucks for beer.
That's right.	So Dean Martin would show up at the last minute and do everything in just one take?
Don't you worry about Wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. We'll change a lot of things.	But Wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.
Yeah, what's the deal, loser?	Martin?! What's a tool like you doing on something cool like that?
Son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--	Can I join, Dad? Can I? Can I? Can I?
Sold.	Not this one.
See ya!	Sold.
Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow.	Oh man.
And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.	I'll get your fabrics!
Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!	Ow! What was that for?
Okay, they bought it.	I mean
Have you got Lou in your car?	Okay, they bought it.
You guys come and get me as soon as they dump me back in the feedlot.	Roger that.
Ready... for... pick up. Ready! For! Pick up!	Okay Lisa, I'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. Huh, I have over four hundred text messages.
I'm a human being -- let me go!	Ready... for... pick up. Ready! For! Pick up!
Hmm... that sounds like Tress MacNeille.	You are now entering the killing floor.
Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human.	Marge... kids... the things I saw. It makes me never wanna eat meat again...
We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!	Why do we have to get here so early? The football game doesn't start for hours.
The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this...	We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!
Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!	The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this...
Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged.	Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!
What could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?	Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged.
All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need.	No, no, no, I'm sorry. It's food, it's food. Everything's what you say it is.
The food is all around us.	It's just forks and plates. Didn't we bring any food?
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching.	You brought us here to beg?
Moleman! Come here, ya big bag-a skin! How the hell are ya, huh?!	Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching.
Can I be Smithers?	No, us!
Why, 'cause I'm fat?	No Dad, I want you to play Homer Simpson.
What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!	Okay everyone -- just be yourself. Don't look in the camera, pretend I'm not here, and... no toupees...
Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.	And... let's roll.
"""Film Festival,"" eh?"	My movie got in! I'm going to the Sundance Film Festival!
Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!	I can't believe I'm a director with a movie at Sundance.
Who are you?	Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!
What else?	I try to answer that question in my films.
Prove it, Hollywood!	I can eat a raw onion without crying.
Hey, you're crying!	Prove it, Hollywood!
What?	Yeah, but I'm crying about something else.
We can't wait to see it, sweetie.	This is it! My premiere!
A documentary?!	We can't wait to see it, sweetie.
One, two, three... Another chute?!	I'm Lisa Simpson. And this is my family.
Why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!	One, two, three... Another chute?!
You stupid kid! What if I walked in here barefoot?	They're like the family from hell on acid that's on steroids!
Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!	Oh, I was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life.
Don't you dare post that review.	"""Lisa Simpson's unflinching, darkly comic family portrait is the can't-miss hit of the festival. Landspeeder, do not Bantha, to your nearest cinema to see Lisa Simpson stab her family in the back with her camera."""
Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!	I'm sorry. You're too late. I have just hit enter, sending the wi-fi beams along their way.
No.	Let me get a picture of you strangling my kid!
I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.	Hey, we pay your salary.
I know! Kinda miss it.	Thank God they're not jeering at us anymore.
Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!	Lead-based toys! Lead-based toys!
Well, this is kind of a cute outfit.	Wow -- this guy could put Milhouse out of business.
What did you say?	Homer is a LARD butt.
It's a medical condition!	Homer has booger breath.
Who told you these things about me?!	Homer is a big jerk.
I don't want to get mad, but I will!	Dung muncher. / Stink brains. / Cheese wang. / Captain Crud.
That's it...	YO WE'RE ROCKIN' OUT BALLS / Tub of Tard. / Crapper Clogger. / Fatty-watty.
It didn't have to go down like this!	Uh, Mom? We've got a code four.
"Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch ""The Defender."""	The door's open! I think someone broke in!
That's where the food sleeps!	I hear noises coming from the kitchen!
Wait a minute, I smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie!	That's where the food sleeps!
Why would a robber make pie?	Wait a minute, I smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie!
You're right, boy!	Who cares? If you kill him, we'll be on TV!
Mom!	You're right, boy!
You're alive! And you baked a pie!	Hello, Homer.
I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!	Homie, what's going on?
"Mom, I can't believe you're here. You keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. You're just like that show ""Scrubs""."	I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
No thanks.	Homer, I'm sorry I had to pretend to be dead. But it worked, because the government isn't looking for me anymore. I can finally stop running and be your mom.
Every time you go, I feel abandoned. But not this time. I'm not gonna let myself get hurt.	What do you mean?
That's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. In fact, I don't even want your pie.	Homer, I'm through protesting and chaining myself to things. I've realized that the most important thing in my life is you.
Well I'm not going to digest it!	You already ate the whole thing.
Oh, I don't even care.	Anyway, the Right Guard Keeping Cool Under Pressure Award goes to--
I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.	Homer, are you okay?
No! I can't forgive you -- and I don't accept your tuck-in!	Sweetheart, when I left you, it was because I thought I could make the world a little bit better. Maybe all I did was make my own world a lot worse. I only hope you can forgive me.
I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card.	I understand -- these things take time. Goodnight.
Mom?	I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card.
Are you asleep?	Mom?
Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?	Are you asleep?
Mom!	Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?
My mother's dead.	Mom!
Oh, this just gets worse and worse.	I'm still with you, son.
I'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.	Come on, Homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever.
She said I didn't suck?	Okay, comforting, comforting... Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And I'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad.
That bad. Wow.	That bad.
I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.	Sorry about your ma, Homer.
I mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? Does she know I feel bad about things I said?	Yes, I will.
That's it.	Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it.
A donut from the future!	Homer, look what I found with your mother's things.
Woo hoo!	And lastly, for Homer, I leave you something very special.
Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right.	At exactly three o'clock, release my ashes. I love you, Homer. And now, because they're your favorite, please enjoy some animal bloopers.
It works on so many levels.	Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right.
I've gotta get out of here!	It works on so many levels.
No...	I've gotta get out of here!
Okay, this is it. I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom. I will avenge you!	No...
I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected.	It's not really avenging her, Dad. Just the fulfillment of her last wish.
This is hard work. Isn't it, boy? Boy?	I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected.
Why you little...	Hey, Homer! Your butt still looks big from down here!
I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me.	You know, spiritually speaking, Grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... So, in a way... uh... I'm lying down now.
To spare, eh?	Excuse me, I think I'm holding up better than you are. In fact, I've got energy to spare.
Marge, your back is so sweaty. I'm starting to slip off.	To spare, eh?
Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere.	Made it!
Three o'clock. Goodbye, Mom. You're finally free.	Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere.
Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?	Guidance system destroyed. Launch aborted.
Hm, what could I make from those two things?	Judging from the wind direction... distance... time of day... the ashes must have come from... him!
I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.	Hm, what could I make from those two things?
Wheee!	I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!	You're not supposed to like it!
I don't think so.	Are you hurt?
You can have her. To me, she's been nothing but trouble.	Here's your mother.
Just what are you guys up to?	Hey, I've seen your wife. She's no Mamie Van Doren.
The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!	I suppose there's no harm in telling you. I'm using the rocket to dispose of Springfield's nuclear waste -- by sending it straight to the heart of the Amazon rainforest!
You monster! On another subject, next Thursday I have to leave work early. I assume that's cool.	Well, maybe she'll like it better filled with dying trees and mutated animals.
Mom, I'm so sorry. You just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. Well, if I get out of this I promise you I'll grant your last wish.	Excellent.
Toss it down!	Here's Gramma's knife!
Thanks, boy.	Toss it down!
How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?	Thanks, boy.
God Bless America!	That's already a thing -- thimbles, right?
That'll do, brick, that'll do.	Fine.
Now I'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.	Homie?
Well then, Mom, this was for you.	But she'll live on forever in what you did today.
Pee?!	"Thank you! Thank you! Wow, four thousand episodes -- seems like just yesterday Krusty stole his first joke from me. Seriously, though, I remember watching him as a kid, and I thought ""I could do that -- and I'm a kid!"" What I love about Krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee!"
Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.	Krusty Klovnen Baby Visker?
I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.	It's clown trouble. That's your responsibility.
"Fine -- but you just bought yourself ""ear piercing"" and ""strange new feelings."""	Yeah, well, we're adding clowns.
Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now.	I don't know why I agreed to this.
Uh, we'll stick with the coins.	Wait, wait, wait! I'll start you off with this bicentennial quarter...and I'll throw in my man scrunchie.
Son... all hobbies suck. But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time.	All right, time to fill these slots with coins. Specific coins? This hobby sucks!
Do you wanna collect coins with your old man?	Wow, I never thought of it like that.
To your mother's purse!	You bet I do.
This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.	Slide in the eighteen sixty-three confederate half-dime... and every slot is full.
We missed one!	This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
The one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. Son, we are getting that coin!	"""...was mistakenly minted in December of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the Philadelphia Mint."""
Wait!	Nope... Nope... Dime... Button... Pepperoni slice...
This is a classic nineteen seventy-eight Pizza Hut! Mmm... terrible.	Wait!
Son, coin collecting's a lot like life. It stopped being fun a long time ago. But unlike life, I have a solution for this.	Nope... Nope... Nope...
Okay boy, this is it. Five dollars!	"Our last item up for bid is a mint-condition 1917 ""Kissing Lincoln"" penny."
Five dollars cash!	Five hundred.
Five hundred and one!	Dad?
Objection, your honor.	Ten million.
Mr. Burns, my son and I have been collecting coins. It's really brought us closer together. That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him.	Mmm... I paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it.
Yeah. I'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. Do you have change for a nickel?	Yes, but the problem is, if you had it, I wouldn't. You see the difficulty...
Aaaaannnnnd done.	I only gave him four cents for that nickel! Monty Burns wins a--
You got it, boy.	Now, let's put it on a shelf and never look at it again.
I'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!	I already don't! Homer, I've got great news!
Three-peat.	Homer Simpson?! You are a repeat offender.
I make that in a year.	Bail is set at twenty-five thousand dollars.
And if I don't show up?	We'll put up your bail money. Just pay us ten per cent and show up for your court date.
What a great job. And I could use a job right now.	Well, time to go back to my world of sleazy bars, tattoo parlors, and greasy spoons.
Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!	So wait -- are we telling people now?
Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to...	Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life.	Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to...
Flanders!	Bullet-proof glass.
"This case is ""in the bag."""	Maybe you're right. Maybe I should...
I sure could've, thanks to you.	Homer, you could've killed him!
Hey, Ned.	Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
I brought you something.	Hey, Ned.
He hands a greeting card to Ned.	I brought you something.
ANGLE ON: GREETING CARD	He hands a greeting card to Ned.
It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.	What the?
Ned, I never thought I'd say this, but we make a great team.	It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
Sure. What is it?	Well... I could use money. But you have to promise me something, Homer.
And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.	We have to do everything by the book.
This taser is awesome. Finally, a practical use for electricity.	Well... okay.
Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.	Did you just taser my coffee?
No problem.	Homer, can we take it easy on the taser?
Let's roll.	Our first bail jumper!
No, it looks cool!	Homer, take the taser out of your pants.
Daddy's home! I brought you kids some stuff from work!	Bible salesman!
Here you go, son. Shell casings.	Daddy's home! I brought you kids some stuff from work!
Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.	Whoa! There's still bullets in some of these!
Something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. A new chemistry set.	What'd you get for me?
The biggest one in town.	Dad, is this from a meth lab?
Evidence that I love my little girl.	This is evidence.
Marge, I brought you some flowers! A full dozen this time! No tricks!	Evidence that I love my little girl.
Yes, for now. I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday.	A sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
What'd you do that for?	How dare you?!
I'm not convinced.	Sorry, sorry muscle spasm.
Still on the fence.	I'm not convinced.
Now I believe you.	Still on the fence.
He'll be here sooner or later.	Now I believe you.
So, how 'bout a little stakeout music?	He'll be here sooner or later.
Well, I like A.C.-D.C.	Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes.
DONE FOR FREE	I like their Christian cover band: A.D.-B.C.! KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS
Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!	Hm. I've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
You've got to roll it from the point. Here, let me show you.	Man, that's harder to swallow than evolution.
Now let it unfurl in your stomach.	Not bad.
There's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!	Oh, kitten whiskers!
Hey, it worked, didn't it? Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag.	Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?
You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!	Homer, no! You promised... Everything was supposed to be by the book!
I'll tell you what's over! This partnership!	This partnership is over!
I can't take another word out of you!	You know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas.
I can't believe Flanders dumped me. Marge, do we have any more of your extra-long Twinkies?	I can't take another word out of you!
Marge, what's going on?	Oh no! Those were for Mr. Smithers' commitment ceremony!
Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how.	I hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?	Homie, what do you say we go to bed? You, me and the cake?
Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Hello?	I'm sure they're all competent professionals, but you'd best leave it to me.
What have you done to my family?	You jumped bail, Homer. I gotta bring you in.
And how did you know I wouldn't be there?	I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
Well, you'll never take me alive!	Lucky guess.
Forgot my keys.	Well, you'll never take me alive!
I loved you, man!	Forgot my keys.
You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow.	For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!
Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you.	I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
So, it's gonna be like that, eh?	I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in.
I've got you, my friend.	So, it's gonna be like that, eh?
Well, I'm--	Thanks, but... what are you holding on to?
Phew. Now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.	Well, I'm--
Aw, dammit!	Phew. Now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.
Make it life and you've got a deal.	Simpson, we're gonna put you away for a long, long time.
Oh, baby.	Don't feel too bad, Homie. You'll be free tomorrow. And I used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me.
Thanks, Marge.	Oh, baby.
Huh?	Bonehead.
This counts as a parent-teacher conference!	Huh?
Did he take the bait?	Lady, you are the best Mom ever!
Hey, he went into a construction site!	Bullies!
We're doing laundry.	What are you two doing in the laundry room?
No problem.	Dad, do laundry.
Eh, he won't get far. Not on the crappy breakfast I made for him.	Look at Bart go! He must be running away!
Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.	He's circling the Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.
Bart! Where are you, boy?! Don't worry, I won't strangle you.	Pull over -- Bart's in this field!
Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds.	Are we ever going to find him?
Is that him? No, it's just a bush. Clearly the work of Wirakocha, the trickster god.	Bart! Where are you, Bart?
The computer says Bart's standing on the computer. All I see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! It doesn't add up!	So I can't always be there for Bart. He's got to learn to take care of himself.
Oh, uh, she's uh...	Where's Maggie?
Stupid shopping list, turning food into work. Bart!	Oh, uh, she's uh...
You better settle down, boy, or I'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera...	Look at me! I'm doin' something!
...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!	You better settle down, boy, or I'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera...
Hmmm, you make a good case. I'll take it!	Mr. Homer, why don't you forget your worries with this -- the last lottery ticket on the roll. They say the last one is lucky! Unlike all the others. Lucky! Or not.
You just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!	"That is true. Another ironic ""Tale of the Kwik-E-Mart""."
I was gonna bet it on the dogs!	I thought it was fifty.
That kid has become a Dennis-level menace!	Hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger.
Bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.	Now Homer, boys will be boys.
I don't want your pity booze. I'll pay for it myself.	Oh cheer up, Homer. The drinks are on Lenny.
Oh, you look great.	Dang that Bart! Thanks to him, I have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat.
Well Marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant...	Why can't our son just behave?
Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!	They're not boogers! They're clumps of rubber cement. That I stored in my nose.
Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals...	Thank you for being a friend...
Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!	Hm, I don't know. I'm pretty attached to my family, and...
You ruin everything! /	As you say, sir. Watch your head.
Human garbage can to the rescue!	Maybe I'm just not hungry.
So at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs.	Human garbage can to the rescue!
"Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said ""No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!"" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--"	Father, could you--
Huh?	Please stop spitting food on me!
That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!	Keep your food in your mouth, you semi-literate spew-monkey!
If that boy thinks I'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! Stupid kids... think I'm made of hormones...	Maybe he's going through... certain changes.
Give me back my newspaper!	Yeah, but that was never gonna happen.
"For your information, the ""Daily Growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"	Homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!
How's the war going? We're winning, that's great! And our standing abroad? Fantastic!	"For your information, the ""Daily Growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"
ALL AROUND THE SOMETHING WORLD,	I don't like the look of those air quotes.
Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!	So now Bart is on his way to Aspen, where they're going to try to kill him!
This looks like a job for Captain Crazy! Up, up and away!	There's Bart!
Aw come on, gravity. You used to be cool!	This looks like a job for Captain Crazy! Up, up and away!
Occupied!	Aw come on, gravity. You used to be cool!
No.	Are you guests at the lodge?
Y'know, I feel sorry for you, kid. Going back to that cold, loveless family.	No.
Take me with you!	Your favorite, sir. Hot fudge sundae with gold leaf and diamond flakes.
I'll be anything and everything you want! Don't leave me here with them!	Take me with you!
Nobody shuts out my blather!	I can't listen to this anymore.
Were we ever that stupid?	Aw... young love.
"Marge, I thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" It's a combination of biking and making out."	Of course we were.
C'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it.	I don't know...
Marge! I love this guy!	As the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!
He rhymes! Oh, happy day!	Put 'er there, muddy buddy.
I wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.	Really? Not married? And you were bicycling two abreast?
Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?	Since two this afternoon. Welcome to our honeymoon!
"Then I now pronounce us ""just dating."""	Homer Simpson, I would be delighted not to marry you.
I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.	"Then I now pronounce us ""just dating."""
Knock it off!	I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.
How dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! Bart! Don't you dare take your eyes off that Gameboy!	Knock it off!
Videogames -- the reason this generation of Americans is the best ever.	I'm cuckoo for killing stuff!
Hey, everybody pees in the pool!	I can't believe Homer ruined another family picnic.
That's it!	Your neck looks like a sideways ass!
Eat gravel, hags!	That's it!
I have the situation under control. The compass needle is pointing east.	GONNA DO THE LIMBO ROCK
Uh-oh.	That's the fuel gauge.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?	Uh-oh.
I know -- I was hoping the number might be zero.	You haven't said you're sorry.
A really fun party? Full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge.	And feel free to stay. We just put out the cheese -- we have cubes of yellow, cubes of orange, and cubes of orange and yellow.
Eh, let my Dad enjoy 'em a little longer.	We'll stay for one hand roll or two Nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!
No, get two of your own.	Oh, for me?
No, I'm trying to get me drunk.	That's strong -- are you trying to get me drunk?
Well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you.	You know, my horoscope said I'd meet the man of my dreams tonight.
No, I'm talking to you, at this great party!	You are adorable! Are you... alone?
Limbo? You mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? Either way, I'm in.	Well then, would you like to limbo?
Or you!	EVERY LIMBO BOY AND GIRL,
SOMETHING SOMETHING LIMBO SOMETHING	Or you!
She's not strange! She's fun! And she doesn't get jealous when I talk to other women!	Why are you dancing with that strange woman?
Sushi fight!!	How about a sushi fight?
These fish died for nothing!	Sushi fight!!
What a cute couple. She's gonna take him for a lot of money.	Thanks for the lift.
Here we are.	What a cute couple. She's gonna take him for a lot of money.
Kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me.	A log cabin? What am I, Davy Crockett? Also, who's Davy Crockett?
I'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.	They're worse than wal-king!
I'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.	I'll take ten bucks no-ow.
Why Flanders, you rogue.	Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye.
"All Marge and I need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""Do Not Disturb"" sign."	Why Flanders, you rogue.
What?! But I have urges!	Sorry, Homer, I'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds.
He's not talking, he's yelling!	That's just your trouser devil talking!
I never thought I'd say this, but... Stupid Flanders.	Aw, Maude. Your dead grandmother's pajamas. You know what that does to me.
Marge?	I'm just happy you're talking again. You didn't say a word for forty-five minutes.
Do you have a pineapple pizza?!	You don't need her, baby. Sylvia's got everything you want.
This is all going so fast.	Pineapple and pepperoni.
I came here once with Marge. Are you Marge, Sylvia?	Eh-eh-eh! First we make love, then we decide if it was a good idea. That's the European way.
I want you to be Marge.	Homer, I can be whoever you want me to be.
Marge?!	I want you to be Marge.
Marge? Is that you?	Marge?!
Marge, what are you doing here?	Why do married women always have husbands?
You better not be! I mean, great! We both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. Right?	Uh... the same thing you're doing here.
Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here.	We sure did. Rekindle, rekindle... Okay, let's go.
I feel the same way about that lamp.	Fine. But I don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
Okay.	Okay, but first the chest.
Listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. But you're goin' in the box.	Homie, what's taking so long?
Coming, Marge!	Homie?
Now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--	No, but don't stop twisting it.
Kids?!	Now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--
That takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?	And we'll stay up forever!
Well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside Boggle?	Homer Simpson, you devil!
Hmm, all right. The trick is to ease them off--	Homer Simpson, you devil! But I think we should unpack first...
You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again.	I can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!
Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare.	You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again.
I wish I'd never met you!	Okay.
Yeah. I missed her like five times.	So... I'm sure you missed Marge last night.
Forever? That would be awesome.	What a charming single entendre. Now look, I know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever.
And I suppose you and Maude will be coming along as well?	Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?
Marge, when I'm with you, I get that feeling like when I got that smart kid's report card by mistake. For a minute, I thought I had all A's. And that my name was Howard Simberg.	She's not here!?
I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it.	You make me feel that way too.
I hate other people's love.	I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it.
"""4 Ever."" I couldn't even keep a promise I made to a tree. Maybe it's not too late! Maybe I can still save our love. If I just show her that carving..."	So that wasn't Marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! I'm getting out of this marriage while I'm still young and handsome.
Saving our marriage!	What are you doing?
I don't want to let go of our special carving!	Take my hand!
Marge, I don't want to die with us mad at each other.	/
I know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, American history...	Me neither, Homie.
Awww.	I know. We had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. The important thing is, we love each other.
She blew it again! Woo-hoo!	Hey, you guys want a lift in my pedal boat?
But we're married.	Knock it off back there.
How about R?	Okay, but keep it PG.
Woo-hoo! Adult situations!	PG-13.
Lemonade!	Lousy dog. If you had your way, I'd walk you every day.
Six cups, please. And put it on my tab.	Lemonade!
Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only.	Six cups, please. And put it on my tab.
Fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! I'm going to Moe's, for beer! Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!	Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only.
Lisa, can Daddy borrow your bike?	Fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! I'm going to Moe's, for beer! Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!
Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you.	Any of you lugs wanna break up with my boyfriend for me? I'll buy you a beer!
No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up.	Splendid! Shall we discuss music, or the weather?
Yeah.	She wants to break up?
Yeah.	With me?
Look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. You have all your hair... unlike me. No kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... Oh, God, I hate my life!	Yeah.
Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?	Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day!
Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead.	Is Lenny here?
And you will again. Because he isn't really dead. And now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...	What? I just talked to him.
Y'ello!	Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
The gay guy?	Homer? It's your old roommate, Grady.
Uh-huh, got it. Marge, I'm going to a hardcore gay club, and I won't be home till three in the morning!	Someone much more cool and refreshing.
You'll always have a special place in his heart!	Grady is breaking up with me?!
Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?	Oh, baby, you are the breakup king. You have made the seven minutes that I'm gonna go without love so much more bearable.
Okay, everyone. Rotate one to your right.	Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?
I'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!	Sweet Conclusions Break-Up Service. Oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented TenderDump System.
Marge, if I had a hundred dollars for every customer I'd broken up, I'd have exactly this amount. 'Cause that's what I charge!	My mistake.
I know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best.	Homie... I'm not sure about this new business of yours. You're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch.
Who are you?	What would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time I had my doubts about you?
Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again.	Homie?
Wow, so this is what this is.	Well maybe...
Surely some holds are barred.	Cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me...	No, none.
Hey, what's going on?	Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me...
Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money.	We found a way to make this tournament interesting. We bet on the matches.
And these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment.	Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money.
I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid.	Agreed. So, who are you gonna bet on?
What is it?	He has a name, you know!
She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never!	I win!
And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed.	Dad, I could actually win this thing!
You what?	My only fear is, I always sabotage myself when I'm on the verge of happiness.
Right, right. But will it happen this time?	"In my young life I've seen that every time I'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" And another little piece says ""I agree."""
Just be yourself.	Wish me luck.
I wanna change my bet... I'm going against my daughter.	Just be yourself.
Fine. I won't look you in the eye.	I'll take your money. But I won't look you in the eye.
Have I made the bet yet?	Fine. I won't look you in the eye.
You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental.	Here's your money. Drenched in your daughter's tears.
No.	Dad? Did you come into some money we don't know about?
Uh... the sun did that.	You got highlights in your hair!
Well, sweetie, Daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. You'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. I hope you're not mad.	What's goin' on?
You sure you're not mad?	No, I'm not mad.
You sure you're not mad?	No, I'm not mad.
Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad? What's that, Mr. Teddy? You're saying that you know women? And that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?	No, I'm not mad.
She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk.	Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad? What's that, Mr. Teddy? You're saying that you know women? And that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?
Lisa? Lisa?	She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk.
Lisa, sweetie... please, look at your Daddy.	Lisa? Lisa?
Nooooooooooooooooo!	Hey, Mr. S... Lisa B...
Yessssssssssssssss!	Would you like to buy some band candy?
Lisa's mad at me, and now she's using Marge's maiden name instead of mine.	Yessssssssssssssss!
Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.	She may never take back your name, but there's still a chance she'll take you back as a Daddy.
Well, I had a little help from this guy.	Dad, I know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the New York Times crossword puzzle?
Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you.	Take a look at the first letters of all the clues.
Kitten calendar.	Um... I'm also returning this kitten calendar.
What does it do?	I see you're admiring our MyCube. It's fueled by dreams and powered by imagination.
Okay. What can I do for you? Please, I'm begging you!	"You should ask yourself, ""What can I do for it?"""
But it's glowing.	Sir, it's not even turned on yet.
Marge, I installed all the low energy bulbs!	Stop!
Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!	What have you done with the old ones?
Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!	Salaam alaikum!
Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid.	Bart forgot this, sir.
I'm really thirty-eight.	You know, Bart never told me he had a handsome teenage brother.
Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view.	Homer, this is serious. This Bashir kid is Muslim, and therefore up to something.
Oh my God. What can I do?	And she loved it!
But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.	Oh my God. What can I do?
Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging.	Homie, it's very open-minded of you to have Bart's Muslim friend's Muslim family over.
Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs.	We met while studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology.
Why don't I get us dessert?	Now bait the trap.
I made us a little cake.	Why don't I get us dessert?
Care to cut? Watch this, Lenny.	I made us a little cake.
What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom?	No, thank you.
Shut up, old man.	I like the way you Italians think.
That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!	I think it is time for us to go.
I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.	You're teaching Bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
Okay, I'll apologize.	Well, I want you to go over to their house and apologize!
Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison.	Okay, I'll apologize.
I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...	Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison.
Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.	I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...
So far so good.	Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.
Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are.	So far so good.
I saw them unloading dynamite!	Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are.
All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it.	Homer, I'm sure you didn't see anything. Go to sleep.
Now do Flanders!	Heeeeere's Genie!
Nooooooo!	No, now I will destroy your decadent Western society.
Hm. Usually that ends the dream.	Nooooooo!
The power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!	Hm. Usually that ends the dream.
Gotta prove the genie was right...	Oh, it's my first MyBill. Twelve hundred dollars?! But I only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!
Oh my God!	But I love blowing up buildings.
I want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. And I thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.	Oh, it's you. What do you want?
Wait, wait, wait, wait... I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. Is that true?	Mr. Simpson, I accept your apology. Goodbye.
Praise be Oliver.	Yes.
We'll look it up in the Corona.	That's Allah!
So... now that we're alone, um... death to America, right?	We'll look it up in the Corona.
Homer, why are you really here?	So... now that we're alone, um... death to America, right?
Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste. Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself.	Homer, why are you really here?
A computer!	Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste. Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself.
I'm in!	A computer!
Springfield mall?!	I'm in!
They're gonna blow it up!	Springfield mall?!
Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you.	Homer? I don't hear almond grinding!
Ow! My finger!	Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you.
Everyone get out!	Ow! My finger!
Run for your lives!	Everyone get out!
Run for your--	Run for your lives!
Uh... stay where you are!	Run for your--
Bart?	Uh... stay where you are!
Boy, don't blow up this mall! It has the cookie store that gives free samples!	Bart?
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!	No, I...
What about the bridge?	Dad, it was an empty building. It was supposed to come down!
Did we really need a bridge there?	That was supposed to open tomorrow.
I'll save you!	The Duff brewery is on that island.
That banner has really paid for itself over the years.	I'll save you!
Oh no, no bees? Oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?	All the bees are dead!
Pfft! Knew it.	Fortune Four lotto numbers are: nine...
Duh!	Seven...
What?!	Three...
Bo-ring!	And...
Flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.	But Dad, bees pollinate flowers.
Thank you.	Honey?
Worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!	Bees.
Animals can get sick?!	"...in there. Close. See these red dots? This bee has been felled by bee measles -- or as I call it, ""beasles."""
You're the nerd.	I'm going to talk to the girl from now on.
Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it. And this time no screw-ups.	There's one on Lisa!
And mine was snakes and yours was...	Uh-huh...
Really? I thought it was Lisa with a beard of bees. Well whatever, brace yourself.	Never being a grandmother?
The secret is not to swallow the stingers.	Um Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes.
They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart.	Dad, don't eat the bees!
Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it.	Listen Lisa, I was trying to think of a way to help your bees and I remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town.
I knew it!	Silence! Now, let's make some noise for everyone's favorite basketball team, whom I have renamed the Springfield Excitement.
I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.	Okay, okay! Don't know why I had 'em in the first place.
Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?	Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited African honeys, and that's what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment.
You and me?	Actually Homer...
Oh yeah, yeah, that's what I meant too. I have no... inclination...	No, the bees!
Yep.	Got the queen?
And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.	Yep.
Sweetie, I have a very special surprise for you.	Wow, this must be important, Dad! I've never seen you walk up an incline before.
Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment.	He's not a billionaire at all!
Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check.	They sound awfully mad. Are they dangerous?
Are you guys dangerous?	Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check.
"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."	Are you guys dangerous?
When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities.	Why do we have to go to the rec center? I wanna play with my friends!
Uh, 'cause no one's making me. Buh-bye.	You're older. Why don't you do these fun activities?
Could've been. If we hadn't had kids.	We could be murderers.
Toldja, Marge. Tol. Dja.	"He found several undiscovered plot twists in ""The Client."" And he proved that the real villain in ""A Time to Kill"" is the legal system itself."
Friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. Also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it.	"Great! Here are a few ""best friend"" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. If her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--"
Okay, honey. If it's that important to you, you said it.	I just said that.
"Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell."""	Now remember, Juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior.
Hey! That was--	Nice doorbell. Is it computerized?
We... I... You come up with an excuse!	Homer!
If you say so, M'lord.	Homer, isn't it wonderful that my Juliet and your Lisa have become such fast friends?
If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands.	Dinner's ready!
When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?	Oooooo!
Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?	I'll go get her!
Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks.	I'm not that kind of doctor!
What a racket.	That's chewing gum.
Well, that's Bart for ya.	Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we need to talk about Lisa. She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own.
Seems like you and I are always talking about Bart, my son.	We're talking about Lisa, your daughter.
Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy.	I search all the children's Facebook pages for unflattering references to me. By the way, I enjoyed the photos of your trip to Yosemite.
I doubt it -- Friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.	I wonder if Lisa has threatened the Model U.N. with her rice tariff yet.
Wait!	"A ""castle""... I know where they are!"
Is it some place I have to put on a tie?	Wait!
Is it a place I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie?	No!
What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?	You probably would.
And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad.	You got a letter all the way from New York City, and that's something!
Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard.	And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad.
No, he's ten days younger.	Homer, that guy's your age?
If he's lucky.	So you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God. Well, God doesn't need his own special day!	If he's lucky.
Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy.	What about Sunday?
If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now.	Your father's just jealous because Vance was our class president in high school.
Yup -- back in high school, right before I met your mother. A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation...	Dad, you ran for Class President?
Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.	There they are, my favorite mixed-race couple!
Tears of a clown.	He looks happy.
Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it.	He's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
Angry nut coming through.	Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it.
Hey, Vance?	Clear a path, boys.
Great, thanks. Listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?	Hey, Homer Simpson! How you been?
Please! You've gotta have some secret agony! I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.	Behind this smile is a bigger smile trying to get out. Oh. Oh here it comes! Oh yeah!
No. Yes.	Got 'em from a buddy of mine with a store in Shelbyville. You want his number?
I'll just stick with my beer.	Hey, Homer, you wanna try my new Vance Connor-politan? Like Vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated.
Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.	Yeah, me too.
Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?	Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.
Al Gore?	Just let it go, Homer.
Ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...	Isn't that right, Alfred? It sure is, Albert.
I've gotta know.	Ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
Lenny! Wake up!	I've gotta know.
That's not why I'm here. Get dressed.	Finally, you returned my shovel.
California casual.	California casual or business attire?
The ballot box?!	There it is!
What will this box reveal? And what will I use this box for afterwards? Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.	Right under this.
Woo-hoo!	Homer Simpson...
Woo-hoo!	Homer Simpson...
Woo hoo!	Homer Simpson.
, or woo hoo?	Please stop doing that.
Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!	Both. Homer Simpson... Vance Connor... Fonzie... Homer Simpson... and the winner is Homer Simpson!
Wait a second. If I'd been Class President like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion and the color TVs and the hot wife!	Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!
Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter.	Hey!
That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!	Dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better.
Dondelinger!	No other foursome would have me. My legs gross people out.
Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me.	Uh-oh. Looks like one of my former students on a quest for truth.
Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame.	I can explain. But... are you sure we should talk in front of your son?
I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.	I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you.
Virgin? What are you, a girl?	With a virgin Tom Collins for me?
Now, Dondelinger, I want some answers.	Virgin? What are you, a girl?
You lie. You love me!	Very well. It's a fact I didn't like you, Simpson. Still don't.
I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.	Very well. Now we must once more stare madly into the sauce.
Huh? Who said that?	Oh, you could know. If you dared.
Okay.	Now, watch the sauce of bubbling red and see the life you could have led.
I would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. Why did fate do this to me?	Ho-mer! Ho-mer! Ho-mer!
Why? Why?	Ask-a the garlic bread.
Come on, stir! I must see more!	Hey everyone! The stupid fat man's talking to garlic bread!
Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know.	Homie, please, nothing good will come of this.
...Debbie Pinson.	Sorry, the only girl I could ever want is right over there...
Hey, Debbie, um... Wanna go to prom with me?	...Debbie Pinson.
I got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful...girl?!	Just keep watching the sauce, girlie.
"Debbie, I forgot I have an English paper due on Monday. Would you read ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how Boo Radley fits into the Southern Gothic tradition, that would be great."	Thank you, Homer.
Homer Simpson. Class President.	Nobody's ever asked me to use my head-brain before!
A lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. May I have this dance?	Oh my God. He's talking to me.
Sorry, Debbie. I hope you can find happiness without me.	Homer Simpson! I was gonna let you get to fifth base! It would've been something you told your grandchildren about!
I do! Oh, right.	Who wants a cheerleader on the rebound?
Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline.	I can hardly believe this is real.
Sweet dreams.	I don't know, but in this reality, I am not gay! Hubba hubba!
Thank you, mysterious weirdo.	.
I'm Class President.	Tell me, what student government office do you hold? Secretary? Treasurer? Dare I say Secretary-Treasurer?
How you doin', Dad?	I was describing beautiful fish, Bart!
Honey, I'm home! Where are the kids?	Oh, I can't complain and I never do! Thanks for lettin' me live in your guest house.
Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah.	Well, that's what's missing. Our lives would be horrible without the kids.
I wanna live in the sauce!	Slurp my snot.
Okay.	Homie, please come inside.
Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?	Dad, we need to have a talk.
Are you kidding? We couldn't even convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman.	Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?
Oh, come on! That millionaire playboy? He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne foundation.	Are you kidding? We couldn't even convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman.
Oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce.	Dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.
Oh, why would you bring me here?! It's like bringing Richard Nixon to the Watergate! Or Kevin Costner to Waterworld!	Sweetheart, I think you'll feel better after we take a little walk...
My own plaque! And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool.	Oh really?
Is that why you brought me here, spirits?	My own plaque! And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool.
I guess that would be nice.	"Yep. In the future, people will look at this and they'll say ""whoever he was, he must've mattered."""
Really? Sure.	Pardon me... can my son have his picture taken with you?
Thanks, guys.	Well, we can't all be Homer Simpson, son.
Hey, was there another plaque here before?	Thanks, guys.
Now let's get something to eat.	Plaques come, plaques go.
God no!	How 'bout Italian?
Ooh, that sounds like fun!	I hear there's a Korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.
...three, two, one. Happy New Year!	Ooh, that sounds like fun!
You're the government's problem now!	It's the first day of school!
Who taught you that language?!	I can't believe we have to start another year of school. I never learned anything at that suck shack.
So you did learn something.	Kid at school.
Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt.	Oh Homie, the insurance bill is due today. Can you make sure to mail it?
What a week.	Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt.
Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?	Dad, Bart's throwing away his future!
Great jokes make me hungry. I wonder what's in the pantry...	Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
Wait a minute...	Wait a minute...
Must be in the glove box.	I.D., please.
Uninsured! Uninsured!	This was due two weeks ago! I'm not insured! For the first time in my life I'm financially responsible for my own actions!
I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!	Uninsured! Uninsured!
Dear. Stupid. Insurance. Company. I. Meant. To. Mail this. On time. What. Do You. Mean. Too bad? Screw. You! Heh. Heh.	I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!
I won't be insured until three o'clock?! Okay, until then, I have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or I'm ruined.	Dear. Stupid. Insurance. Company. I. Meant. To. Mail this. On time. What. Do You. Mean. Too bad? Screw. You! Heh. Heh.
Marge, I won't bore you with the truth. All I can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house.	Homie! What are you doing home so early?
Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.	You mean back to the poor house?
Me too, baby. But we gotta get real.	I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
Book club? That's the most stupid boring thing ever. Oh, thank you.	We can discuss it later. Right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club.
Oh yeah.	Oh my God! Oh my God! We're totally liable!
I mean, nooo!	Oh yeah.
Okay, I just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds.	I'm playing with Elmo!
Kniiiife!	Oops.
Got it!	Kniiiife!
Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time.	Apaches!
So, plans for the weekend?	Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time.
Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause I'm about to file a claim.	No, sweetie. At this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. Who was I to think you could mail an envelope?
OH MARDI GRAS / OH MARDI GRAS / YOU SEE A LOT OF BOO-BIES...	And finally, effective immediately, I'm overturning this school's ban on dancing.
Boy, where are my zydeco records?	OH MARDI GRAS / OH MARDI GRAS / YOU SEE A LOT OF BOO-BIES...
I know they do, but the Simpson Mardi Gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. And we spare no expense.	There's twelve more boxes. And they all sound the same!
This counts as that.	What about my birthday party?
Ladies, how're you doing with the float?	This counts as that.
No problem.	Hey Homer, I have some distant relatives that I never see except for this party. Can I bring 'em to the party?
Ha, ha! Eat my food! Drink up my drink! Put your coat on my daughter's bed! I command you!	Oh, right. We came together.
Hey, Flanders. Listen, uh... we're having a party...	Fine. I'll invite him. But he has to wear the outfit I choose.
So, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not.	I noticed.
Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker.	Homer, I always wonder, how can you afford this party year after year?
Fine, Mr. Skeptical. Give me back your beads.	Huh. I'm not sure that's how it works.
Beads, please.	But, but, but...
Marge, don't worry. It's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. They stopped calling us. In fact, everyone did!	Homie, do you know anything about this?
Oh man. Who'd think the first day of Lent would be such a bummer?	I think we should go see our mortgage broker.
Listen, you! When you gave me that money, you said I wouldn't have to repay it till the future! This isn't the future! It's the lousy, stinking now!	Oh, wait. I left out a zero.
That poor man. Is he okay?	Don't be sore at the banks. Hell, we fired our C.E.O., and he barely got out with fifty million dollars!
Don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. I ripped all the copper wire out of the walls.	I know, I know. But Bernice wants you out.
Did I what now?	Did you remember to disconnect it first?
Goodbye.	She is. Look.
Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more.	I need a place to store my cufflinks.
And on the zillionth day, God created hugs.	Well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, I appreciate the sediment.
And it was gooood.	And on the zillionth day, God created hugs.
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. I left a little uh ""surprise"" upstairs for the new owner."	Come on, kids! Let's take our stuff back inside.
HE SAVED OUR ASS!	FOR HE'S A FABULOUS FLANDERS, WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY!
No problem. Just let Sir Fix-a-lot slay this chore.	Homie, the faucet won't stop leaking.
Next problem.	No problem. Just let Sir Fix-a-lot slay this chore.
It's so beautiful. No two are exactly alike. Though many of them are very similar.	Well, let's see what else is in the job jar.
I'm back, baby!	It's so beautiful. No two are exactly alike. Though many of them are very similar.
He what?! Flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! You lounge around in your Egg MacMansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!	He won't come over!
Some friend you are. The minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. You'd better just pray I don't find out where you live!	The rent check is late.
Bart! Don't forget to turn the chicken!	Some friend you are. The minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. You'd better just pray I don't find out where you live!
Yeah, you'd treat her right.	People like Flanders make me sick. If I was Marge's landlord I'd fix her pipes and I'd shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the South Seas and I... I'd never return.
"Oh, right -- like ""Dateline"" did to you!"	Well, here's how you get back at Flanders: you go to the media and get them to expose what a horrible person he really is.
We live in a house that is trying to kill us.	Seven forty-two Evergreen Terrace. A tiny slice of suburban heaven. But like dating an actress, what seemed like heaven soon turned to hell.
"Who is this ""Dad"" you speak of, Lisa Simpson?"	Hey, Dad.
Yes.	You want a cookie, Dad?
...Squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...	Yes.
Poltergeist in the closet...	...Squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...
Why you little...	I died when Homer sat on me!
I'm the victim here!	Why you little...
Kadiddlehopper.	Homer Simpson, I took pity on you, and what do I get in return? A kick in the kadiddlehopper!
Fine. You're mad. What are you gonna do about it?	It's not funny! That's how I swear!
Fine. I'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!	When the month is up, I want you out!
Flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on Christmas, would you?	Your leaving is our Christmas!
It is me, Jesus!	Wha? Who's that?
I have come from my workshop in the North Pole to say: don't evict the Simpsons!	It is me, Jesus!
It was... um... do you have a computer nearby?	"Uh, say, ""Jesus,"" what was the name of the son of Zachariah?"
He's nailing something to our door.	It was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
Ew, that's gross.	Hm, I wonder if it's theses.
Don't worry, Marge.	"Homie, I think it's an eviction notice. We're gonna be homeless, like Lucille Ball in ""The Stone Pillow""!"
"According to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: ""Evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over."" Finally, a practical use for my father."	Don't worry, Marge.
I'm using you!	What's the catch?
My own devices!	For what?
Hey, Flanders. You can't evict us because a senior's living here now.	I've already moved on.
Will you kids knock it off? I'm trying to watch badminton!	You're never too old to ruin things for the young!
Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf.	Right, 'cause I wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes Billie Jean King, Susan Sontag, Sappho of Lesbos, and, I suspect, Peppermint Patty...
"So, after I paid for the ice cream cones, I said ""thank you"" and was on my way."	This is what I call livin' in the past!
"I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called ""Bart's Mistake."" We were walking home when"	We know, Dad. We were there.
How could this have happened?	"I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called ""Bart's Mistake."" We were walking home when"
Well, I can't compete with that!	Flanders feeds me people food!
Honey, don't cry. It could be worse -- at least it's not raining!	Oh my God. We're out on the street!
See, I told you, it's not raining. So we're just homeless.	Honey, don't cry. It could be worse -- at least it's not raining!
Kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy.	See, I told you, it's not raining. So we're just homeless.
That's not true. You have bug bites you can scratch.	But kicking is the only toy I have.
Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again.	Well, hasn't this been a peach of a breach! We'll see you in court.
Never! Hooray for Stupid Flanders!	It's okay if you backslide a little.
I really hate this neighborhood.	The Simpsons are back!
Yeah, right! And I'm married to Wonder Woman!	I really hate this neighborhood.
No, I'm gonna see it first!	I'm gonna see it first!
My space toy!	Hit the road, ya big load!
I finally feel like part of a family!	For years... for years...
Wolves are taking all our women.	"Now Simpsons, I must warn you -- any stress could increase the blood pressure in Marge's eyeballs, leading to what we call ""Tex Avery Syndrome."""
You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.	You guys have treated me like a princess. Every day's been like the first ten minutes of Mother's Day!
Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?	Dad! Come in the kitchen! Quick!
Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater.	Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy.	Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater.
Hmmm, this is good.	Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy.
Good, but not great. I'll go get some rat poison.	Hmmm, this is good.
Not in front of the poison man!	No, you stupid dog -- that's Maggie's bunny!
Whoever's biting me, stop it!	Not in front of the poison man!
How am I gonna get us all across this river?	Why did I bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?
A boat!	How am I gonna get us all across this river?
Oh, we're too heavy.	A boat!
Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby.	Oh, we're too heavy.
Can't someone help me with this puzzle?	Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby.
Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!	Can't someone help me with this puzzle?
Yo! Over here!	Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!
Great time to nap, Einstein!	Wha--
Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!	Great time to nap, Einstein!
Were you listening at all?	Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!
Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing.	Well, the puzzle done puzzled itself out.
I see you! I see you!	Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing.
I see--	I see you! I see you!
Catholics!	Look at that -- one of God's discarded miracles.
Give me my baby back!	Catholics!
'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!	Any child left here will be cared for by the Sisters of St. Teresa. Why would you leave such a beautiful baby on our doorstep?
Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!	No. The poor dear is right where she belongs. God help you, sir!
Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie.	I'm married to Jesus!
Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun.	Wait, I have an idea! One of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent.
Told you there was no way I would do it.	Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun.
Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.	Told you there was no way I would do it.
Huh?	Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.
Um... No problem, sweetie.	Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day. Can you hand her to me?
Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.	Hm. You're not usually this greedy.
No, Marge. You're the most giving person I know. Besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne.	Maybe I'm just being selfish. I don't know.
You told me something, but I wasn't listening!	You told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.	I'm sorry for fibbing. Tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home.
Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!	Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.
That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm.	Well that sucked! / There's a day we'll never get back! / I was so bored.
Maybe it's beef stew!	What is that soothing sound?
Hot tubs!	Maybe it's beef stew!
Guys, what's it like?	Hot tubs!
I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!	Getting a back rub from an orgasm.
Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?	"Oh, you mean the ""YouSoup 5000."""
Beats me. / I'unno. / Please, please, please!	Wait a minute, who am I pleading with?
Go back to your day spas!	I'm on it.
Interesting proposal. Now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.	Maybe we should get out now.
Hey, Flanders! Why don't you join us? Afraid you'll get your moustache wet?	Hey, cool your jets! We're trying to get to sleep!
Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.	One of us should go look at it.
Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions.	The thing is, I ain't got much life left to live. And a wasted day like today is one I know I'll never get back.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?	Well, there are a few things I was hopin' to do before I become dust in a jar.
"Okay... ""Pitch in the Negro Leagues,"" I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."	Anyway, I made a list.
"""Have one more beer at O'Flanagan's Pub..."" We'll do that one!"	"Okay... ""Pitch in the Negro Leagues,"" I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."
This place is in Ireland?!	"""Have one more beer at O'Flanagan's Pub..."" We'll do that one!"
Lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!	That's right. Now let's make our reservations.
Sir, I brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar.	Everyone got jobs, that's what happened.
Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!	D'ye mean it? Look, don't toy with an old man's heart, now.
You okay, Dad?	THIS IS THE LIFE IN IRE-LAND...
Well, Dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an Irishman?	So Long, suckers!
Hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? How about you, Greensleeves? Irishmen love to get drunk.	Never heard of half this stuff! This brandy is fifty years old. Better toss it.
Who are you, stuttering Fonzie? What about you, bicycle pants?	I'm in A.A.
Why you...	I'm late for a teleconference with Hong Kong, ya fat gob!
Uh-oh.	Why you...
Our first sale!	Uh-oh.
Our first refund.	Our first sale!
Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?	Sorry, but smokin' in pubs ain't part of the new Ireland. Also, you can't text while driving.
We are so screwed!	Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?
Ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. It's as if Danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.	And quit sending her pianos!
Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm.	Bite your tongue! That will never, ever happen!
Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!	No, it's how you fly coach on Delta now.
So, what can't people do in modern Ireland?	The law? That jerk?
People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!	What has happened to the ways of old?
Moe, you were right!	Gentlemen, we have a lot of work to do!
"Well, ""Da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter."""	Homer and his Da!
I can't tell if those are questions or statements.	So, it's escapin' you're thinkin' of, then?
Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out. America is the New York Yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand.	Son, this was all my fault. You were just trying to make an old man happy.
It was apt.	Oh son, you know how I love a good analogy.
Let me say I've always admired the Irish. Knute Rockne, Larry Bird, and especially Mr. Potato Head.	It was apt.
But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?	There you have it -- news has never been softer. What's that? The parson is here!
"So I hope you'll forgive two well-meaning Americans for trying to take Ireland back to the good old days of ""Angela's Ashes."" Thank you."	But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?
Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!	The Parson?! He's coming here?
Suckers!	Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!
Reverend Lovejoy? You deliver pizza now? But we didn't order a pizza. But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again.	Fly away, ghosty! Go back to your haunted cornfield!
You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real.	Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when I wasn't actually a minister. Uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed.
I need that paper quick!	Who are you calling an old lady?
Why you little bastard...	Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.
Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world.	This isn't the most romantic place to get married.
Hello. It's me, Lance Romance.	Hello?
Your first mission is to look out the window.	Hello. It's me, Lance Romance.
Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?	Homer, what's going on? The violin, pants with a crease, why?
Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb.	Oh yes, Homer! Yes!
How'd you check?!	Well, the last time I checked, pirates weren't gay.
Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge.	How'd you check?!
Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.	That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one.
Chocolate.	No rockets! You can pick the frosting.
What if we...	All right, people, I want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation.
But there is, Marge! The first two letters...	"There is no ""we"" in wedding!"
Why not?	I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl they could bring dates! 'Cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla.	Because their R.S.V.P. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?	Bridezilla? A combination of bride and Godzilla? How could you say that? More like you're a... King Wrong!
What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I?	You have my deepest sympathy.
What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle!	What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I?
Who would do this to me?! It would have to be someone who could afford a chain.	What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle!
But I have to marry Marge!	You're going to be here a while.
Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression.	As of now, your pathetic little life means nothing.
I miss you so much.	Interesting nuance. I'd like to hear more about it, but uh, company policy forbids chitchat.
You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!	To remove that chain, you need the key to the lock.
To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful.	You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!
What the?	To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful.
Whose side are you on?	The lollipop is made of hot sauce.
Malge! Ahmiss oo. Ahmiss oo so mug...	"Nice of you to think of me. However, ""SB"" could be anyone -- Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei, the former Polish secret police, the Służba Bezpieczeństwa... Or..."
What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic.	...fun with fire ants?
Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm.	Wow, you're the smartest guy in that room.
Just see that my fiancée Marge gets this -- my wedding vows.	Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm.
Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.	Just see that my fiancée Marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you.	Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.
I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters.	Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you.
I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn.	He's right here.
Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?	I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you.
I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding.	And with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. Next!
A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted!	Just what I always wanted.
I love to see this!	Oh, ya hate to see this.
Stop him, Babando!	Hold the Black Label, Mabel! The Utica Mohawks' Pete Mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense!
I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends.	You're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
Wha-wha-what's the score?!	So that will do it from Wayne Bockhorn, Jean-Pierre Pétomane, and me, Doc Jacques Lalonde, here at Utica's Kill-Kwik Rat Poison Arena.
The score, damn you!	"Now stay tuned for ""Picking the Perfect Apple,"" it's already in progress."
Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage.	You want to know the score? I'll tell you the score.
Yes?	Here's the score, Mister:
That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?	Your daughter barely knows who you are!
He is pretty good with her.	That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?
Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high.	Maggie.
Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!	Can you at least bring a sweater for Maggie?
Not even heated up. Typical dog.	Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!
This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning.	Not even heated up. Typical dog.
Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder.	This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning.
Moe, what are you doing?	Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder.
Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?	Huh. I got a window here.
Aw, her first enabling.	Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?
Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.	Ooh, hey Maggie! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!
Ooh, Maggie made some new friends.	Uh, well they're both here, and neither one's your husband. This press conference is over.
Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident.	Ooh, Maggie made some new friends.
"I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."	'Cause he can't remember limericks?
There you are!	It's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!
Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.	There you are!
How would I know?	Dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into Maggie?
I have not! Oh right, you think I do.	You've been spending so much time with her.
Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about.	Here she is, uh, Homer. The wonderful girl I been tellin' you about.
In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?	Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about.
Man oh man, slap a ring on that!	Well... If I remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine...
Here we are, Maggie. That park you love...	All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to.
See you when the moon comes out.	Here we are, Maggie. That park you love...
Man, that made me thirsty.	See you when the moon comes out.
I'll save you, Maggie!	Okay, no more delays. I've got to watch this.
I'm telling!	I'll save you, Maggie!
Now what?	I'm telling!
Aw, sweetie, you saved me. Well, I promise that wherever you go in this world, I will always be there for you.	Now what?
Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me.	Aw, sweetie, you saved me. Well, I promise that wherever you go in this world, I will always be there for you.
Whatcha watchin', honey?	Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me.
And I'm good at beginnings.	Homer Simpson, you are a strong finisher.
Not a thing in the world.	What's the matter, Homer?
Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile.	Yeah, I wish I could say the same.
Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse. He's a bad influence on you.	Byyyyyye.
"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm."	Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse. He's a bad influence on you.
And now, you're gonna visit your Grampa while I park around the corner and take a nap.	"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm."
Don't shake your fist at me!	"Chocolate chip for Donald, low sodium for Abe, ""not made by immigrants"" for Sam, and imaginary for Major Preston..."
Boy.	I spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. Why, here he is now. Lookin' good, Homer!
Look, man, I don't want any trouble. C'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?	Just wait.
Oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name.	We believe Lisa is suffering from Environment Related Despair.
Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do.	"Lisa is a little young to be taking ""happy pills."""
We done here?	Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do.
Yeah, busboys get all the chicks.	Um, if this girl I'm seeing comes here, and she might, I wouldn't mind if you told her I was the kind of boy that does the dishes.
Son, girls come and go. But you'll always have your family.	I can't believe she dumped me!
Big deal! I could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.	Maybe we should just check out the street performers.
Oh, this is great, honey. Thanks for telling me about it. I hope you don't mind I invited Lenny.	I can't wait to tell everyone!
Ooh, lamb-kebab!	Maybe I'll keep this to myself for a while.
Ooh, chicken-kebab!	Ooh, lamb-kebab!
Ooh, fire-kebab!	Ooh, chicken-kebab!
Water!	Dad, yes!
Burn, Barty, burn!	Why... you... little...!
Is it 'omplimentawee?	No it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!
It is? 'Ey every-ody, 'eck out I 'ompliment!	Yeah, sure. It's complimentary.
"I held up two, for ""peely!"""	Got it.
Well, at least I can eat again!	"Oh, I thought that was a Y, for ""yanky."" I'll make a note in your chart that you aren't always clear."
Mmm, cherry.	Well, at least I can eat again!
Too much cherry!	Mmm, cherry.
Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry.	Too much cherry!
Doctor, why is this happening to me?	Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry.
I can't eat tacos?! Oh my God -- what day of Mayo is it?	Homer, you have become a super-taster. The mildest spices will overwhelm your tongue. Even a taco could drive you insane.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!	Cinco.
I still taste over-tones of pink!	Try these beets. I boiled all the red out.
Hm. It feels like food. But it has no flavor whatsoever.	Dad, I've got the perfect thing.
What else do they got?	It's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. The blandest food known to man.
Man, who comes up with this stuff?	Pecan blandies... cream of steam... You Guess 'Ems...
Don't have one.	Lunch card... Lunch card... Lunch card?
Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!	Dad, what are you doing here?
Oh, come on, relax, I won't embarrass you.	What? No!
Uh... can I work it off? Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.	Three dollars and eighty-five cents.
OH, I'M BIG AND YELLOW / AND I'M SERVIN' JELL-O / IF YOU'RE A FELLOW AND YOU WANT SOME JELL-O / YOU'D BETTER BELLOW / HEY, BIG GUY / GIMME SOME JELL-O	I'll start you on Jell-o.
Up-bup-bup. No Jell-o for you, Bart -- it'll keep you up at night. Like last week when you crawled into bed with me and Mommy?	OH, I'M BIG AND YELLOW / AND I'M SERVIN' JELL-O / IF YOU'RE A FELLOW AND YOU WANT SOME JELL-O / YOU'D BETTER BELLOW / HEY, BIG GUY / GIMME SOME JELL-O
Hey, there we go.	Sure is hot back here.
Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.	Hey, there we go.
Buddy, I'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation.	I used to date your daughter.
Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Am I wanted?	Dad, do you have to hang out at my school? It's bad enough I have to be here three days a week!
Wow, he's terrified of you.	Albany! Annapolis Atlanta! Augusta! Austin! Baton Rouge! Bismarck! Boise! Boston! Capital City! Carson City!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? Isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?	That's why I'm here -- to make sure he gets good grades.
Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.	Well, call me over-involved, but some day your son will be my son's chauffeur.
"I don't have to ""helicopter"" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called ""Lisa."""	"It's not your son's fault, it's yours. You have to hover over your kid's shoulder to force him to succeed. It's called ""helicopter parenting."""
Marge, where have you been?	Oh my God, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. Way to go, Marge!
No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.	Well, I...
That makes sense. Movin' on.	No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
...if we don't get more involved in their lives, Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures. Failures who work for... Noah!	That makes sense. Movin' on.
Aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?	Noah. I like that name. No-ahhh. Noah. Noah!
If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!	Am I?
Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.	If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!
There's no future in that!	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
A thousand dollars?! That's what my house is worth!	Don't forget, children -- Monday is the balsa-wood model-building competition. The American Balsa Council will award this year's winner a thousand-dollar savings bond for their college education.
Time to take control of my son's life. Let's see, what can he build...	I'unno.
Too obvious.	Time to take control of my son's life. Let's see, what can he build...
Gotta be something from Earth.	Too obvious.
You're no help.	Gotta be something from Earth.
Perfect!	You're no help.
I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!	My mistake.
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!	I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!
It tells you how you can get popular.	"Lisa, I found this book in the ""What's Wrong With My Daughter"" section of the bookstore."
Sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the Continental Congress. Dolphins swim in cliques. Those are my two examples.	Dad, if I join a clique, I'll be the kind of person I hate.
And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats...	Hmm, well, they are good ones.
"Let's try what chapter seven calls ""Un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."	And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats...
See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?	Well that's very nice of you-- Hey! You sayin' my clothes are clown-like? Oh God, I feel so insecure! Please be my friend...
Ooo, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean everyone everyone. Hope you don't mind.	I do! / Yeah! / You know it! / Oh boy!
And that, my dear girl, is called the Toledo Take-back.	If I didn't sell booze, they probably wouldn't even come here.
I see. Well, maybe you're not ready for this book. It is more of a big girl thing.	Dad, I don't want to hurt people's feelings.
Enough to build a Washington Monument.	We'd like some balsa wood, please.
What cologne are you wearing? None of your business! Now we'd like our Washington Monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.	What scale are you using?
What do you mean? And who are you?	Washington Monument? Aren't you gonna even try?
But, you...	"I'm your son's principal, and the Washington Monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. It's like saying ""I don't care. My kid's a loser."""
What's the hardest model there is?	But, you...
Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build Westminster Abbey!	Hmm, that would be Westminster Abbey.
Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions.	You won't get past the north transept!
Marge, the boy and I will be making Westminster Abbey.	Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions.
"But first, as part of ""Operation Popularity,"" Lisa and I are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."	Blabby's gonna build an Abbey. Groovy.
Brittany and Kaitlin are here! Where's my spray-on tan?	"But first, as part of ""Operation Popularity,"" Lisa and I are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
Ant poison? Why do I always read the labels after?	Brittany and Kaitlin are here! Where's my spray-on tan?
Ladies, we've got it all. Rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys.	Ant poison? Why do I always read the labels after?
Hello, little girl, who do you belong to?	I am such a great parent to both my kids.
Hey boy, why don't I do that for you?	Hello, little girl, who do you belong to?
All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and I'll take it from here. A little further back.	Isn't this supposed to be my project?
Naw, that kinda creeps me out.	Do you want me to watch and learn?
Must finish Poet's Corner... or Bart will work for Noah... with his hot mom...	Naw, that kinda creeps me out.
Geoffrey Chaucer?! What are you doing here?	Homer, don't give up till you finish my dear Abbey.
Anne of Cleves!	That's terrible advice.
Oscar Wilde?	Oh, and where is this delightful boy?
But that makes no sense!	Homer, there are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.
Shut up!	"""Experience"" is simply the name we give to our mistakes."
"Whatever happened to ""boo?"""	These days, man knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
Now we could smash the real Westminster Abbey so it looks like this.	"Whatever happened to ""boo?"""
There are no flights to London till five!	Now we could smash the real Westminster Abbey so it looks like this.
Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off!	Congratulations, son. At least you followed the rules.
I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.	"Why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. In the words of Oscar Wilde: ""Experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes."" I saw him too, Dad."
I H-8 this?	I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.
Yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing I can do as a parent is simply check out.	I'm sorry, Dad. These girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. I hope you understand.
Lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off.	No, there's a middle ground.
That's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.	Not if you use a dimmer switch.
I tried to fix the kids' lives, but instead I led them to rich and rewarding personal decisions of their own.	What's wrong, Homie?
That mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?	Well, I know a place in this house where you can really relax.
It was stuffed with cash!	No, I gave that to the homeless shelter.
Oh yeah.	Feeling better, Super Dad?
I can't understand that math reference, because I went to Springfield Elementary!	Look at this: Springfield Elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm.
Oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! You're always gonna be friends with Milhouse. STAND BY ME / OH, STAND BY ME...	Wait, wait, wait. You're putting us in a new school?! What about my friends?
I need to rent an apartment in the worst part of Waverly Hills -- the crappier, the better.	OH, STAND NOW / STAND BY ME / STAND BY MEEEE...
"""Ahso sheepay"" to you."	Ah, so cheap, eh?
I can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.	"""Ahso sheepay"" to you."
Sometimes there's not a train going by.	I can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.
Four walls? I was thinking more of something in a two or three.	Sometimes there's not a train going by.
Yeah, um, well, I'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. Where's the bedroom?	No windows, no parking, and a man died here.
Tempting. Tempting. Where's the bathroom?	Right here.
I'll take it!	In the Ethiopian Restaurant at the end of the block.
WAVERLY HILLS / THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE / SQUATTING IN WAVERLY HILLS. / WAVERLY HILLS / GET EDUCATION FRAUDULENTLY / MOOCHIN' OFF WAVERLY HILLS.	I'll take it!
Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.	It's just a formality to make sure you actually live here. Some people use the address just so their kids can go to our schools.
Heads. I mean, tails. I mean, on its side.	Call it, friendo.
That's not enough.	Well done. Now, let me validate your parking.
Thank you.	That's not enough.
When do I get to move back home?	It's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
The heat is off. The hissing from the radiator is a snake.	You just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. You can come home when the heat's off.
That's another twenty or thirty years.	Please just stay there till Bart graduates high school.
That was great. You mind if I use that at work?	Brought you a housewarming present.
Well, I love to play, but I'm not very good. Also, I always forget to cash my chips back in for money.	Hey, are you into poker?
You make words into dudes.	This man-crush just got bro-mantic!
Your hair smells nice!	She didn't even know who Alaska Nebraska was.
S'open!	You have the right to be delighted. If you do not have a gift, one will be provided for you.
Marge! I'm glad you came. There's a kegger down the hall. We can go as soon as I desecrate this corpse.	S'open!
Eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! I'm sorry, Marge. Where are my manners? Did you want to taunt my kill also? Press the X button.	Marge! I'm glad you came. There's a kegger down the hall. We can go as soon as I desecrate this corpse.
I'll get us some brewskies.	Ooh, I'm doing it!
Cup, m'lady? Or would you care to funnel it down thy throat?	I'll get us some brewskies.
Foam wasn't spilt in a day.	Definitely a cup.
Two, actually. Twins.	Does she have a sister?
I was an astronaut for a little bit. So many rules.	Twi-ins!
Woo-hoo!	We don't need a bed. We're not gonna be sleeping.
We're not the only ones having a good time.	Woo-hoo!
Maybe you could come over again. I'll cook you my special microwave burritos. I stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.	What in God's name was I thinking?!
How 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?	You know what a girl likes, mister. So, can I see you again?
Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...	I love Tapas! It's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
Be sure to dig around in the gunk.	Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
Why can't I have it now? You got your present here. Basic fairness dictates... ...oh!	And I've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment.
Where are my videogames? My X-box?! My Wii?!	Surprise! I redecorated!
You know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife.	"You don't need a Wii now that I'm here. Because you and me make ""us."""
What movie?	Wait! I want to ask you something.
I went to a movie.	Where have you been? We have mirrors to hang!
I drove.	Without me? How'd you get there?
Sometimes I think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!	Without me?
Thank you, Friendo.	"""Go Dog Go"" with pages missing... Lego spaceship poorly assembled... Clearly, this is the home of elementary school children. Too bad. I was looking forward to killing you and making it look like a suicide."
But, I thought... you said...	I am not your friendo.
I can't leave my bachelor pad! My bros'll miss me!	Three weeks! This has gotta be some kind of record!
Why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?	Your comments when we watch movies aren't funny.
What do you think, Marge? Maybe we've outgrown our first apartment.	Please, I just want to go back to a place where I'm ostracized for being me, not for who I pretend to be.
C'mon, boy! Be cool!	Get a room!
Be cool or you're grounded!	But...
Marge, I need some bribe money!	That's nice.
Thanks, Marge. But don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit.	Deal.
Well, I may be playing a tree but at least I'm getting my face out there.	I wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
Hey, there's no way I could ever be as good as that guy.	I thought I was marrying a man who could play Macbeth.
You're not suggesting... murder.	I think Mel would be happier as an understudy. A six-feet-understudy.
Whatever you say, sweetie.	"Wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting ""I dare not"" wait upon ""I would?"""
A prop knife!	Snore. Snore.
He who laughs last, laughs dead.	Out, out, brief candle! / Life's but a walking shadow...
Why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk?	He who laughs last, laughs dead.
Well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks.	"That ""crazy talk"" is the work of the immortal Bard, William Shakespeare."
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more / By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis... uh, To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow... today's Tuesday, so that would make it Friday, and then, uh... Shakespeare!	As you all know, this afternoon, the bone fell out of Mel's hair and beat him to death. Let us observe a moment of silence. Moment over. Homer, you got the lead!
Conrad Birdie? Coming here to Sweet Apple?!	You don't even know your lines!
"""Dammit, Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe."""	"That's ""Bye-Bye Birdie""!"
Who the hell is Banquo?	Tonight the Springfield Community Playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... Dr. Hibbert as Banquo?!
Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons?	He's the one getting the good reviews! Which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
That's inspiring. What's that from? X-Men 2?	Screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
Mac-who?	Macbeth!
Why do they write a new review of this play every single day?	"""In last night's 'Macbeth,' the best performance was Barney Gumbel as Duncan, followed by Duffman as MacDuff, Lenny Leonard as Lennox, Eddie and Lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, Homer Simpson."""
No, dear. I'm a man, dear.	All I heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. Unless you're not man enough.
KILLING MAKES ME HUN-GRY	No, dear. I'm a man, dear.
EATING MAKES ME THIRS-TY	KILLING MAKES ME HUN-GRY
DRINKING MAKES ME SLEE-PY	EATING MAKES ME THIRS-TY
Ow!	That's where you're wrong! Get out on that stage!
It's my moment.	Okay Homer, it's our last performance, you're the only actor that's still alive, and there's nobody in the audience -- this is your moment. I'll be in my office going over the books on my Subway sandwich franchise. You call a sandwich maker an artist, it's like an invitation to steal! A guy's goin' nani-nooni bananas in there!
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more.	It's my moment.
Me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.	Henry The Fifth... Titus Andronicus...
Goodbye, fat me.	Alright, Maggie. Today is parent-teacher day. So I want everyone to see how uncreative and beaten-down you've become. That's right, you're beaten-down. Yes, you are!
I don't know how you put up with all these kids, Toohey. If I were you there'd be a lot of strangled babies.	Goodbye, fat me.
Can you help me out? I need change for a dollar. Oh, I also need a dollar.	Don't you latté-sipping leeches understand? I've seen enough of these Hollywood super-hunks -- we need a dumpy, unappealing loser -- an everyman!
Great! Do you want to see me naked?	You... Are... Acceptable!
Let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. Lisa?	Oh, there's no nudity in this movie.
Great. Okay. Marge, go.	Well, I qualified for the National Math Bee--
You? Awesome. Next.	Guess who the garden club elected president?
Eh, they can go to Hell. Bart?	No. I lost.
"Time's up! Okay, Maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me."	Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--
Some Hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie!	"Time's up! Okay, Maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me."
Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby.	Homer, we have a problem.
Do you want the Golden Globe?	Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby.
"I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: ""Yo, hot dog man!"" ""Yo, peanuts!"" Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what ""yo"" means?"	"We need you to slim down, muscle up and become the ""Everyman"" people want to be instead of the one they actually are."
Finally, the answer to my problem. What do you do?	Maybe...I can help Lyle McCarthy.
Hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones.	Here's what Brad and Angelina looked like before they met me.
Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?	Homer, do you know why you eat?
Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate .	Something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.
"Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's ""Heroes?"""	"I'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. We don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song ""Eye of the Tiger."""
This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage?	Yeah, it's your montage.
A montage of me turning a ragtag Little League team into state runners-up?	No.
Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?	No.
Ten thousand one, ten thousand two... aaaand fit.	Let's just skip ahead a month.
Was that Tobey Maguire?	I gotta take this. Tobey! Cider house rules! Total wuss. Seabiscuit, you keepin' off the sugar cubes? I hate this guy. I love this guy! Tobe, Tobe, Tobe, we talked about this -- if the rice ain't brown, don't chow down! Look, I gotta bail, I'm with Everyman right now. No, no, no, no, no don't worry, he totally sucks! I'm only lying to him. Goodbye! Bad-bye.
But how will I keep from overeating?	Was that Tobey Maguire?
Found this on the roof.	And sexy! Heroic! Sexy! Heroic! And sexy! Heroic! Earn that money!
What'd you think, kids?	And cut!
Your other hand.	What was that?!
This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends.	Oscar! Take a shower! Or a tomato bath, or something. Please!
A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness.	I'm being paid to do what I love!
Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?	Homer? Homer Sapian! Can I have a word with you? I know this is a bad time, but I'm leaving for another gig.
But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.	Just remember what I taught you.
He's gone.	I have taught you well. Goodbye!
One cheese cube couldn't hurt.	He's gone.
Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one.	One cheese cube couldn't hurt.
It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.	Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one.
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!	It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.
You. You watch.	Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman.	Avery, I swear, you're the only man in Gothamopolis who's never seen Everyman.
Oh Marge! I'm ready for some lovin'!	I'm getting a bad feeling about this film: the star's overweight, we're way over-budget, and the grasshopperaptor we built seems to have developed an evil mind of its own.
Nag, nag, nag.	I think you may have put on a little weight.
Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?	Nag, nag, nag.
Uh-oh.	Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.
I'm right here! I've been here all along!	Everyman! Show yourssself!
What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? Tell me. I can take it.	What happened, dude? You went from Everyman to Everywhereman.
I knew it!	"Okay. It was Turtle from ""Entourage."""
Just you and me?	It's how I make my money.
That could work.	You, me and Turtle.
You just said both those things to me.	He is a great guy. He's an awful guy.
I'm so cold.	Though legislation was passed to insure Everyman was never seen on screens again, he remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child looking for justice. Or just hoping to see bad people beaten up.
Okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. Show me some of Bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades.	Disco Stu is about more than just disco. I'm also super Christian!
I'm not asking for A's. Just incompletes.	Okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. Show me some of Bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades.
I said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?	What?
You're the first teacher that ever got me.	Yes. Just one: relax. You're clearly a caring father.
No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.	Dad... am I bad on the inside?
"When you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""	Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?
Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion.	No, I mean teacher.
The one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! Ohhh.	What discussion?
Not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly.	Thanks for bringing me here, Dad. I'll remember this day on my deathbed.
Maybe.	Whoa. Maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
Ask him.	Stupid Romans.
Ah yes, filthy, but obscure. With a subtle scatological undertone.	Sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?
Pay the man, boy.	Sure, no problem. Twenty-five dollars, please.
Now listen, son, I know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. Do it at the schoolyard. Someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass Joe Biden.	Pay the man, boy.
Kill! Kill. Kill.	Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right.	Tell her, Dad! You love Ultimate Punching even more than I do!
It wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! Frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!	Chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! She got to you! With a piece of black forest cake!
I couldn't help it! She knew my one weakness -- that I'm weak!	Glad you didn't come cheap.
Five, six / Who's got tix?	One, two / We say boo! / Three, four / Stop the gore!
Yeah, Marge. He'll knock your block off. Your beautiful block.	Mom, you can't fight that guy.
Listen: of all the crazy things I've ever done, this is the craziest. And you're doing it.	Thank you, Homie.
Watch your language, moron.	Or kick the crap out of you.
How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!	Someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. This goes against every feminist bone in my body, but Dad, can't you control your woman?
We've gotta get Marge some professional training. Carl, do you know heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum?	I know the woman I loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense.
Well, I... uh...	What? You think just 'cause I'm black I know all other black people?
I'll bash him with this book!	"""Beat, Slay, Shove."""
Marge... I bet we've got ten minutes till the kids wake up.	Saratoga slam! Aristotle's dilemma! Knickerbocker knucklebreaker! And so on.
There certainly is.	There must be a better way.
Marge Simpson reporting for duty!	There certainly is.
Uh, Moe, I have a confession to make: I'm just Homer dressed as Marge.	"Well let's go, ""Marge."" My class reunion starts in an hour."
Well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night.	Yeah, but last year I took Barney dressed as Marge. Think how much better they'll think you look.
I'll save you, Marge!	Oh, thank God, the pressure's off.
Ooo, ooo, can I go, Marge? Can I? Can I?	Two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
No holds barred.	"No. Let's go home. We can enjoy some mixed ""marital"" arts."
The math checks out!	We start with Grade A beef, feed that to other cows, then kill them and serve the unholy results on a seven-grain bun. Burger Squared!
Well, we're not going out to help him. We have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!	The munchers got Moe!
How do I know you're not a muncher?	Please let me in!
I can't make sense of that muncher talk!	I'm your father and I need your help!
Really?	Dad, no! That's the last book in the world!
Then we must keep this boy safe from harm!	Oh my God. If Bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!
You mean tell her I love her? Or I meaning you?	You must get him immediately to the safe zone, just outside of town. And if you see my wife... tell her I love her.
Now remember, no loud noises. Oh man, that breeze feels good!	I'll just high-five her.
To the panic room!	Now remember, no loud noises. Oh man, that breeze feels good!
To the panic room store!	We don't have a panic room!
Another politician who can't keep his promises.	Come with me if you want to live.
Well, this day can't get any crazier.	This way!
Well, well, well.	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it.
Who's an unproductive worker now?	Well, well, well.
Got your nose.	Who's an unproductive worker now?
I think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?	Dad, are you becoming a muncher?
Ooo, mouth.	Where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?
Woo hoo! An unattended tap! Like takin' beer from a baby!	JUST ONCE I WISH CUPID / WOULD DRAW BACK HIS BOW / AND SHOOT ME A CUTIE / WHOSE STANDARDS ARE LOW...
Helllp me!	He what?!
Help me or kill me!	That uh, that's me. I've been taking ventriloquism lessons.
WHILE TURNING GAY THE OTHER DAY / A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME...	Read on. It gets gayer.
I'D LIKE TO TRY MOST EVERY GUY / FROM HERE TO TIMBUK-TEE	WHILE TURNING GAY THE OTHER DAY / A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME...
OH, THERE'S SO MANY MEN AROUND THE WORLD, OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE / I WANT TO NIBBLE ON JAMAICAN JERKS AND TERIYAKI THIGHS...	I'D LIKE TO TRY MOST EVERY GUY / FROM HERE TO TIMBUK-TEE
I WANT TO FRENCH KISS A FRENCHMAN, AND SPOON AN ENGLISH DUKE / 'CAUSE FRANKLY, DEAR, TO NOT BE QUEER, JUST MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE...	OH, THERE'S SO MANY MEN AROUND THE WORLD, OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE / I WANT TO NIBBLE ON JAMAICAN JERKS AND TERIYAKI THIGHS...
SO FIND YOURSELF A MAN WHO'LL WANT YOU IN THE SACK	I WANT TO FRENCH KISS A FRENCHMAN, AND SPOON AN ENGLISH DUKE / 'CAUSE FRANKLY, DEAR, TO NOT BE QUEER, JUST MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE...
I RECOMMEND / OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND / BARTENDER MOE SZYSLAK!	SO FIND YOURSELF A MAN WHO'LL WANT YOU IN THE SACK
SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO WORSE!	I/YOU COULD DO...
Of course I do, Marge. Can you still love a man who's half-beer?	Homer?! Does this mean you still love me?
To love!	I always have.
Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...	Definitely hands-off. He didn't mind if we punched in a little late, or not at all...
Can't we just all supervise ourselves?	Ah, I expect you're all anxiously awaiting my choice for your new supervisor.
Woo-hoo! Our boss is our best buddy!	Hmm...
Yeah!	The nitwits are runnin' the goofhouse!
Hey Carl, why aren't you high-fiving?	Yeah!
You see, he hasn't changed!	And the first beer's on me.
"Hey Carl, look how I messed with the names on the softball sign-up sheet. It's delicious! You know how Smitty's name is Smitty? Well, not anymore -- I changed the ""m"" to a--"	Whoops!
"...to a ""p"". Spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks."	That'll do, Homer.
Oh, well... I didn't know that.	He had to have part of his tongue removed. That's real funny.
Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?	Great safety report, Homer -- no meltdowns all week. I'm making you my new executive assistant.
Not an option, big fella. Either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!	Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?
Oh fine, I guess I'm at your beck.	Not an option, big fella. Either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!
Nooooooo!	And call.
Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.	Homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages.
His astrologist will show up at the same time as his astronomer! This is not good! This is not good!	Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
Marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?	Who am I kidding?
"Stupid Carl... ""Update the phone list, Homer!"" ""You put my contact lenses in backwards, Homer!"" I'm sorry, honey."	Tomorrow, my love.
Leave me alone, you two!	Book me a massage.
Honey, I know it's been a rough couple of weeks. But I booked us a night this Saturday, at a very romantic hotel.	Homie?
Ocean view, obstructed.	Garden view?
Lemme try.	"""NUZZLE... NECK"". With pleasure!"
"""LICK... EYES."" Um, I'll try again. ""SPANK... HAIR."" What the? ""WHISPER INTO... ASS."" This game sucks!"	Lemme try.
We're gonna be snore in the morning...	Why don't you just roll me?
Okay. Kiss me, baby! Kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!	Dammit, why won't you touch me?
I'll make it up to you, Marge, I swear.	I need you to book me a room at the Ritz, with a view of Jim Morrison's grave, and book me dinner at that place... you know the one, the one Lenny's mom read about two years ago.
Actually, those were Carl's shirts.	Last night was the making it up to me! The most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
Hey, it's not like I want to go. Go, go, go!	I can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
I will! Edamame?	"You know Homer, when I was your age, it was the future, ""cause I'm younger than you. Just something to think about."
French Nuclear Commissioner Etienne Ducharme.	Thank you, um...
But I have to get back to Marge.	When we get back to the hotel, I want you to extend our stay... indefinitely.
Where I should've been all along...	Homer, there is a moth in my room! Where are you!?
In Springfield.	Where I should've been all along...
"Oh I don't think so! You know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? She's the first lady of France, Carla Bruni!"	What?! Homer! Return to the immortal City of Light at once! Or you're fired!
If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock.	"Oh I don't think so! You know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? She's the first lady of France, Carla Bruni!"
You wouldn't dare!	If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock.
Oh wouldn't I? Just listen.	You wouldn't dare!
Allo, you are getting cozy with Sarkozy.	Oh wouldn't I? Just listen.
Okay, Okay, you win!	Allo, you are getting cozy with Sarkozy.
Hey Ned.	Homie, you're back!
Marge, I believe we have a little unfinished business. Come with me!	Hey Ned.
Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?	Boy, that was worth the wait.
Classic.	Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?
Gotta leave early to beat the traffic. Now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. For crying out--	Dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on Sunday?
I hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!	Gotta leave early to beat the traffic. Now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. For crying out--
I can't take it anymore!	Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it!
It's daddy's turn!	Bonk-bonk-BONK it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it Bonk it! Bop it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it!
Stomp it! Crush it! Kill it!	It's daddy's turn!
Finally, some peace and quiet.	Bonk it! Bonk it. Bonnnnk it...
Why do my actions have consequences?	Finally, some peace and quiet.
Now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm.	Why do my actions have consequences?
Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.	Now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm.
What happened?	Oh don't worry, we don't kill it. We just dip it.
Where's the hooch?	What happened is, I saved your life. Now you's had a rough day. Why'n'tcha have a pull on this?
A female that gives birth to alcohol.	This here's my pride and joy: 'Ol Betsy.
Well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. And I detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game.	What's your take, city boy?
Lisa! Lisa!	Things said in the circle have a surprising way of coming true.
Oh sweetie, I found you! Now, who's gonna find us? Help!	Text your Mom to pick us up.
Mmm, not bad.	We'll let the authorities sort that out.
Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob.	You said you were at a parenting class!
Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.	That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
Hmm... Hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!	Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.
Start the ride!	Well, I think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in Lisa's life is which boy will marry her. Right, Homer? Homer?
Again!	Start the ride!
Oooh.	Now, we've seen how cookies crumble and soda gets its pop, so let's take a close up look at America's favorite drop -- the gumdrop!
Back to the horses! Back to the horses!	In Outstanding Lighting Direction Electronic Multi-Camera for Variety, Music or Comedy Programming, we have... a three-way tie!
"Gee Lisa, looks like tomorrow I'll be shoveling ten feet of ""global warming."""	Back to the horses! Back to the horses!
"I see. So you're saying ""warming"" makes it colder. Well, aren't you the Queen of Crazyland? Everything's the opposite of everything. La-de-da-de-da! I'm Lisa Simpson. La-de-da-de-da."	Global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
Son, I love you kids. But I'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I ain't comin' out.	Dad... I want a baby brother.
Girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and I don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause I don't know.	Lisa got a sister! Why can't you have another boy?
Point and shoot.	You never told me how my body works.
Do I smell tarragon-crusted Atlantic salmon?	No, I killed Kenny yesterday. What did I do now?
"You had me at ""five-course,"" you lost me at ""romantic,"" and you got me back at ""dinner."""	Bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
And it's not over yet.	Oh what a lovely evening.
Yeah!	Maybe we could do both.
We couldn't do both.	Yeah!
Hm, people in other countries make love? It's about time.	Homer Simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our DVD player.
"Ooo, look! ""Congress Of The Crow!"""	"""The Yawning Monkey?"" ""The Pair Of Tongs?"""
All right, all right, um, your ankle goes there...	Okay!
And turn that upside down...	Uh-huh, and now hand me your neck...
...don't look at that...	Mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
Holy moly!	Oh, Barty, I'm sorry. But your father and I think that three kids is just perfect.
Oh, sweet Meerschaum, take me away.	C'mon, I'd be an awesome big brother! I've got videogames! A treehouse! A garage stuffed to the rafters with illegal fireworks!
Uh-oh.	Oh, sweet Meerschaum, take me away.
Well, welcome, Charlie! Nice to meet ya! No glasses -- way to go! This one's a keeper!	You're gonna be seeing a lot of him around the house.
I know you miss him, boy. So let's you and me spend some quality father and son time.	So many sisters... save me, Bart!
That's so fake. That's so fake. I don't know how they-- Too real!	I know you miss him, boy. So let's you and me spend some quality father and son time.
Oh, c'mon! Look out! What would that guy-- Look out! That's funny.	That's so fake. That's so fake. I don't know how they-- Too real!
"Did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""	Sounded like I said naked bacon.
Yeah. It sounded like naked bacon to me. I don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, Tom.	See. We all thought it was naked--
"No, you said ""naked bacon."""	But if you--
Do you guys know Funky Town?	Well, I'll tell you, you may both agree, but folksingers never say take it naked bacon.
Oh, I love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!	Do you guys know Funky Town?
Now to seal you in for safety.	Oh, I love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!
Hurry! If we don't get a seat in the splash zone, I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!	In one minute, we'll be starting our rock-quatic roll-tacular!
Dad, bathing suit!	You know, I did sit on a shark once...
Oops, no bathing suit.	Dad, bathing suit!
Get to the show!	Let's give a wet and wacky welcome to Springfield's oldest performing mollusk...
Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?	Slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
No, I get my news off the internet.	Seen the paper?
It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.	Well, sir, it looks like your Dad is a quotable notable.
Nope.	It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.
How come Grampa never shares those stories with us?	...Clark Gable owes me a book. And he never paid me for the shoeshine. But his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. Lunch butter we called it.
Marge, my brain is like a computer, and I file away Grampa's stories in a very special place.	He does all the time. You just never listen.
Hmm, while I'm up there...	Marge, my brain is like a computer, and I file away Grampa's stories in a very special place.
Oh Dad, I got you some scotch. One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get.	Ooh, I like this kid.
What the?! Well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been.	This man's more of a son to me than you've ever been.
Stay out of this, Dad!	I don't think that's true.
That's it! Here's your ring back.	You only care about me now because I'm famous!
It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about!	Ring? What ring?
Drop that pillow!	This isn't Larry. It's just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls! Where's the real Larry?
Stupid Grampa. I try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!	And if this is Homer, you're too late for my love!
Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch.	Maybe you're not really mad at Grampa. Maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
Why you little... oh, I can't. When I look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you.	Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch.
I'll kill you! You son-of-a--- Don't look hurt. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.	Why you little... oh, I can't. When I look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you.
I'll show Grampa. I'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories I can share with the world.	I'll kill you! You son-of-a--- Don't look hurt. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, great stuff. And the life lesson is?...	... and that's how you win an opium war!
"Hmm... I'm just gonna put ""haste makes waste."""	The Yangtze River swallows all secrets.
Isn't that cute? He thinks he's a pack.	Release... a hound.
I have a column I'd like to submit. Pay me whenever.	It's dark down here.
What? Pulitzer Prize application form?	I'll just take this to our editor.
"""When I rode with Abe Simpson on the Tinseltown Starliner, I never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? At three o'clock on Monday, Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""	What? Pulitzer Prize application form?
How would he know Grampa was going to die today? Unless... he was going to kill him! But would someone really kill a man just to win a Pulitzer Prize?	"""When I rode with Abe Simpson on the Tinseltown Starliner, I never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? At three o'clock on Monday, Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""
A little lower... a little lower...	HERE COMES THE PRIZE / PULITZER PRIZE / I'LL FINALLY BE SUCCESSFUL / IN MY MOTHER'S EYES
How can you stand up to this punishment?	As long as it's not a dude!
Dad, I don't have the right words to say how I really feel about you, but at least I know how to beat up a guy who does.	So many... hat boxes.
Just with indifference.	Well, at least you never tried to kill me.
Really? Me? You mean it?	I sure did. But why don't we let Homer tell the story.
I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?	I think you're ready for your first ramble.
"Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""The Rolling Stones."" The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen."	I'm hangin' on every word.
...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.	Time to try out my new deep fryer.
Aw c'mon, Marge. There's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head.	I don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work! I can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits...	Hey, don't listen to me! What do I know about rainbows?!
"...groaning with a ""United Nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves..."	None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work! I can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits...
You... can't... do that...	I'm afraid your daily donuts are no more.
D'oh!	No!
They took away our donuts at work! All I've had are my meals!	Easy there, habitrail.
I guess these days headhunters can be anything.	I'm a corporate recruiter who specializes in nuclear workers.
You nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. Times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'.	I guess these days headhunters can be anything.
Do you want to come in and get your sister with me?	That's exactly how I'll take it!
Watch your language! Now, why the hell not?	Hell no.
Oh Bart, you say that now. But when you're grown up, you'll just think it. Now you stay here and I'll get your sister.	The Krusty Show sucks now. It's all pink and princessy. Why are great things always ruined by women? The Army... the Fantastic Four... think how awesome American Idol would be with just Simon and Randy!
Man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!	You got it, Gator.
Goodbye, power plant. I'd better get out of here before I have a meltdown.	Oh Bart, this is all happening so fast! Let's call my mom together!
You can't win us back with mere donuts.	Oh, I imagine Cap City's been wooing you with trips to the seashore, a Christmas goose, Spanish lemons... folderol I can't afford to match. But please, accept this little going away present.
That is the most amazing donut I've ever tasted.	Oh, but these aren't just any donuts. These donuts were made the old-fashioned way: the dough is sweetened with Cuban sugar from pre-Batista plantations, then it's deep fried in the tallow of three different animals, two of which are now extinct.
AND YOU LIKE POTATO...	YOU LIKE POTATO...
AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...	YOU LIKE TOMATO...
potato!	potato!
TOMATO!	TOMATO!
TOGASAKI-ROTHMAN!	AND TOAST... VALERIE AND DAAAAAVE!
Songwriters who are stuck!	Can I just ask, who the hell says potato?
Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride.	Homie, I'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people...
See you at five on the dot. Phone kisses!	Wait, I'm shooting at Nazis? That's not how I remember it.
She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl who I married, who used to be my friend.	Homer's got a girlfriend!
"""Today is your lucky day."" Yeah, pfft!"	"Mine says ""Something you lost will soon turn up."" My faith in the Lord -- it came back!"
Hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--	If it's your lucky day, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.
Hmm, maybe this is my lucky day.	Just as the cookie foretold.
A disc? Please be compact, please be compact! Woo-hoo!	Hmm, maybe this is my lucky day.
Here we go.	A disc? Please be compact, please be compact! Woo-hoo!
OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN...	Here we go.
I IS! OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN I IS! BOO-WEEE-BOO-WEEE-WEE-DOO-DOO-DEE-DEE-DOO-DOO	OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN...
"C'mon, line, move! Maybe it'll speed up if I make ""can you believe this"" noises. Oh for goodness sake--"	Now let's get that ticket.
...Yo no creía en fortunas, pero entonces me salió una galleta...	Thank you, come again. Who's next? Hello
...que decía que hoy era mi día dichoso. Primero no lo creí, pero entonces me caí contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!	Sí, sí...
I'm almost there... I can see the church steeple in the distance...	Homer! Where are you?
Uh-oh, here comes a train.	I'm almost there... I can see the church steeple in the distance...
Tickets, please. Hey, where's your ticket? Leave me alone! Why you little...	/ / /
No time to pretend we're friends! Lotto me!	Good evening, Mr. Homer, how can I--
One, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five.	No time to pretend we're friends! Lotto me!
I did it! I'm gonna make it!	One, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five.
I'm a-comin', Marge!	POTATO... TOMATO... LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING--
I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it!	There, there. There, there, sweetie.
I didn't make it?	I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it!
I'm alive! And surrounded by the...people I love the most in the...	Oh thank God you're okay!
Could you scooch over a bit?	I'm alive! And surrounded by the...people I love the most in the...
I'll try.	Seven-oh-seven? That's exactly the moment I was furious at you for missing our toast. And now I'm the one who has to ask... Can you forgive me?
Now, what should I buy first? Hitler's baseball? A mirror that gives me advice?	Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me.
Oh yeah.	Wait a minute, Homer! You can't spend any of that money or Marge will know you lied.
Marge? What are you doing?	Oh yeah.
Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me.	The laundry. The machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it.
Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree.	Why don't you just buy things your family needs, and leave them where they'll find them?
I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.	That's not the money tree.
Catch, boy!	I think I'm lookin' at a poop later.
Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why don't you go find it?	Catch, boy!
Why you little...	You threw it, you go find it.
A box? No way!	Ow! There's a big box in here!
A new washing machine? No way!	A box? No way!
You go rent us a truck.	That's just what we need! But how are we going to get it home?
"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""	Ow!
Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.	"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
Why... I'm just...	What are you doing?
Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer...	There's money in this tree. What the hell is going on?
Son, if I was interested in fun, I would've run away the day you were born.	Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?
You're right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I should've been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?	Look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. You work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot.
Um... your cut of what?	Don't forget my cut.
Here.	So... where you from, Homer?
Wait!	Here.
Do you think you could use someone like me in your band?	Yes, Homer?
I said someone like me, I didn't say me.	Yeah. Come on up. You can play the tambourine.
Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!	Here we go, folks -- the ultimate zero-gravity experience!
Race you to the cockpit!	Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!
Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.	No way! I wanna go a million more times!
With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!	Rich kids don't need school! When I grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super.
Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed.	With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!
Blackmail your father in space, will you?!	Oh yeah? If you don't keep splashing the cash, I'm gonna tell Mom that it's thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever.
Up -- that's my chair, boy.	Who's ready for Panini?
Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?	I'm not a dude, I'm a hottie!
I agreed to no such thing!	Oh great, now that Dad's gonna star in it.
Where and what time?	Mo-om...
Never!	Homeroom, eight a.m.
What do I wear?	Mo-om...
Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.	Homer! I need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice!
Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon as I finish these oats.	No time.
Not if I tell her first.	Hey, hey, hey. Let's not get crazy. If you quit, I'm telling Mom everything.
Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold...	Okay, but just 'cause I'm your best friend, don't be afraid to use that whip.
Surprised?	Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold...
Marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, I have something to confess. Um... I wasn't there for that wedding toast because... I was buying a lottery ticket.	"Well, I kind of got a clue when I heard that ""ballooning safety"" video."
You have a right to be angry. Furious! And even though that ticket won a million dollars and--	You were what?!
Uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... I spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, I didn't know you could rent a balloon...	We've got a million dollars?! Screw the toast!
Yes, but I have one more thing to show you.	So we're right back where we used to be.
Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am I off the hook?	Oh my God!
AND YOU LIKE POTATO...	YOU LIKE POTATO...
AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...	YOU LIKE TOMATO...
Carl, you're a liar, but I love it.	Homer, you don't look fat.
Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night.	Don't leave until you find that leak!
I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic.	We're appalling!
It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.	Really? How romantic?
Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie.	It's so noisy in here! I can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
We're outta here.	Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie.
How about bromance?	This isn't fair! I want romance!
Dude...	It's not the same.
This bromance just got interesting.	Dude...
Would you like to wear mittens or go commando?	A sport that encourages hand-holding.
What, they come here on Saturday night to clean the ice? Losers.	Sorry, no skating tonight.
Marge, this is perfect for both of us! It's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!	...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!	Maybe you'd like to give it a try?
Curling is real.	Yeah, like the time you said Dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?
Great curling reference.	"Hey, look who ""slid"" into our ""house."""
There's a Winter Olympics?	Astonishing news out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin: the Olympic Committee has announced that Mixed Curling will be a Demonstration Event at the Winter Olympics!
Olympic trials, eh?	Homer, while you were imagining what the Winter Olympics were, Seymour said we were all going to the Olympic trials!
Sweep! Sweep! Left, right! Left, right! Back-and-forth!	Oh, wise guys, eh?
Pack your winter coat! We're going to Canada's warmest city!	Homie! We're going to Vancouver!
She used to be my therapist.	Homer, who's that?
I couldn't hear the last thing you said! Goodbye forever!	Pay your bill!
OH, A PORK BAO, A SHRIMP BAO, EVERYWHERE A BAO BAO / HOMER SIMPSON WINS A GOLD / SLIDING ROCKS ON ICE... BAO BAO!	Hoo-hoo!
Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?	Well, Homer's my soul mate! And you don't dump a soul mate!
Hm...	Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?
Uh-oh.	Well, no matter what you do, it won't make up for Sir Slip-a-lot over there.
That's my Marge! High-five!	This is the sort of bittersweet melodrama Olympic coverage feeds on! I admit it! We're vampires who suck on shattered dreams!
It's stuck!	Sorry, but I'm afraid she'll never curl again.
Can I help you with that?	Joy is but the shadow pain casts.
I'll do it myself. When we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!	Can I help you with that?
Ooo, you're hot when you're horny...	I'll do it myself. When we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!
Ooo, you're mad when you're angry...	I'm not horny, I'm mad.
Marge, you're really good with your left hand.	Ooo, you're mad when you're angry...
But this time, on ice!	Let's give the Olympics a miracle!
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!	The U.S.A. has won Demonstration Gold. Our first and only medals of these entire Olympics. Kids, open your history books, tear out the pages and put this indelible Olympic moment in!
Oops.	U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
How's this for a date night?	Oops.
Wonderful, Homie.	How's this for a date night?
Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few...	They're all horrible!
Alcoholics.	Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few...
Listen, Lisa. You're gonna find more than you bargained for. If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past. I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason.	Not a one! Maybe the nicest was Abigail Simpson, who you know as the Pittsburgh Poisoner...
I warn you: I don't know what's in there but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud.	This entry's dated April 14th, 1860.
Me neither. For once, the Simpsons were in management!	I can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
Good point, Bart.	"Then they should've called it the ""Above-Ground Normal-Road."""
That's a great story, Lisa! And you should stop reading right there.	Very good, Bart.
"Well I don't. The motto of the Simpsons is, ""quit while you're ahead."""	What are you doing? I wanna know what happens next.
Time for bed, sweetie.	But-but-but-but-but...
You still reading that thing? I'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. Ever!	I must know!
I got an idea: you can march to Selma -- and tell her she's ugly!	Ooh, good idea. Bart, what are you doing for Black History Month?
The library? Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?	To the reference desk!
Leave me alone! I have shares to crop!	You're a liar!
Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you.	I'll take that secret to my grave! Or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumpin' me!
About Virgil.	Okay, I'll talk! D-Day is June 6th! Repeat: June 6th! Allied forces will land on the beaches of Normandy in the following order: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno... are you writing this down, Fritz?
And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!	That's why my jazz is so smooth!
So that's why I love drinking so much.	I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French. You know, Bouvier?
C'est la vie, baby.	I'm French, not you.
What the... you're a month behind on homework?!	Credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?
A little!	I tried really hard to stop you from finding out. Does that help?
I say this boy needs more homework.	One month? That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
I don't have to do it with him, do I?	I say this boy needs more homework.
Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.	I don't have to do it with him, do I?
Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh...	Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.
No problem. You can unload.	Thanks for doing the dishes.
Oh my! A child who doesn't enjoy school? Hello? Hollywood?! You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? A million dollars? Deal! Now I have to write it.	Y'know -- I think Bart might have too much homework. If they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever.
Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!	Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?
Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair.	Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!
"Too late, Marge. I already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."	Dear Lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that I am right as usual.
Yeah, right.	There's no such thing as prayer blocks!
You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.	The violence really relaxes me.
Well don't be wrong in front of our son!	Don't contradict me in front of our son!
No line... near the men's room... I see no reason to question your choice.	"Let's have lunch at ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Eggroll."""
What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!	Smooth move, Mom -- tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer.
That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!	The last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!	Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!
Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!	You practiced all day on my birthday!
I was too! The words were in my brain!	You were never going to apologize!
No freedom! I have no freedom around this house! After sex, I'm not talking to you!	I don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!
You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!	Well then there won't be any sex!
Must win fight... must win fight...	I play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
Let me say to you all: I'm pretty sure this is not a dream!	Must win fight... must win fight...
Oh my God, I killed her!	Let me say to you all: I'm pretty sure this is not a dream!
Must apologize. Must apologize.	That pacifier's the last true friend you'll have.
We can't let Bart drive us apart. He's the reason we had to get married.	I'm sorry we ever fought.
Bart? Bart who? I'm being cute.	Till the two of us are back on track, Bart can fend for himself.
Awesome breakfast, Marge! Breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair.	Put down some flares, boys. We're gonna be here a while.
Whatever. Knock yourself out.	Dad, I know you're gonna say no, but Mom would say...
You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, you're on your own.	What do you mean?
Uh, Marge? I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh...	Really? Okay.
I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!	Which flavor do I save -- the Radical Red or the Blueberry Blast? Curse this Squishee's choice!
Yeah.	Oh my God, Homie -- we're having a real conversation!
Don't know, don't care.	You won't believe how I got home.
I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. Lisa! You're a wonderful child! Keep up the good work!	Nope.
Sorry!	Thanks, Dad. But you're so loud it's hurting my ears.
But Marge, I thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage.	And there's a map of the subway system attached. Homer, we've got to stop him!
Fine. I'll do both at once. We should both take a role in vacation planning!	We're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
Bart!	Oh Lord, let me finish this hallway. Then you can send me to hell a happy man!
Oh, there's a nickel.	Bart!
Well I'll be! There's a sofa in here!	Destroy! Destroy! Boy, look at that iron work.
Must... squeeze... harder!	Well I'll be! There's a sofa in here!
Why you little...	Must... squeeze... harder!
Woo hoo!	Why you little...
And no TV!	Mister, you are grounded!
And when you're out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though I don't know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out.	And I'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!
Thanks to our new G.P.S., I'll have you at school in no time.	Want to know what happened in China yesterday? Read the paper! And if Mom and Dad want a little privacy...Junior can be flash-frozen until further notice. Because this is the most wonderful world of all...the world of tomorrow!
Meters?	Turn right in... fifty meters.
Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.	Dad, no! That takes us into a construction site!
Seatbelts, kids!	Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.
Why you...	Turn right in two-point three kilometers...
Hey boy.	Anyway, I'm really hoping you could... Dad?
Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.	But I need to talk about man stuff!
That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?	On the top of the slide.
I could kiss you.	That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.	Mr. Simpson, I'm an attorney, and my husband is a federal prosecutor, and neither of us is happy.
You're halfway home, lady.	And we will make you regret the day your son was born.
No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.	If I talk to Nikki, I'm sure I can--
Well, don't worry, boy. I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls.	And it means the world to me.
And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!	This is awesome! If only real life was in 3-D.
I finally caught one of Bart's school plays.	I'm Bart Simpson. Disruptive fourth-grader.
Yeah, now that I look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody.	That's not Bart, it's Principal Skinner. Bart's sitting right next to you.
Why you little...	Shut up, fatso.
Hey, my bathing suit came off!	"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
Hold that thought.	...man I ever met!
Here comes the butt!	"I sense a ""but"" coming, Reverend..."
Hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do I sign up?	Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests.
I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.	Homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!
They're okay with applesauce.	I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.
A truckload of applesauce!	True enough.
Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!	The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!
After we see the stations of the omelet bar.	Homer, that's not why we're here. We can see the stations of the cross!
He's going for the record! He's going for the record!	Lord, please help Homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land.
Flanders, you're not supposed to help him.	He's going for the record! He's going for the record!
Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card.	Homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?
Pan-thers!	Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card.
If you say it like Dracula I will.	Homer, could you at least turn the camera off?
Please, please, please...	Homer...
That is going right on stupidflanders.org.	Bleh.
This really means a lot to you, huh?	Y'know, Homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. Please, neighbor?
Boy, are you lousy at reading minds.	Yes, but it means more to you.
Okay, okay. For you, I'll try.	Boy, are you lousy at reading minds.
I'm not, it's my ringtone.	Homer, quit playing that back.
Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is.	I'm not, it's my ringtone.
Hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?	Sad. Maybe, if you were Brad Pitt.
Why you little...	"""Dear Lord, don't let Marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night."""
Give my Dad another heart attack?!	Why you little...
I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior...	Homer, this is the most sacred spot in Christendom, not your backyard hammock.
Porky Pig?	Unknown? This is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
But he is buried here, right?	Porky Pig's not a man, he's a pig! And he's not even a real pig!
Chickpea Fizz.	You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
Whatever. It's your camera.	Delete! Delete! Delete!
Your parents made you?	Homer, do you know why I'm a Christian?
What? But I thought we'd be neighbors in Heaven. Goofing on all the new dead people...	It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving.
Ned! Ned, wait up!	Not. Worth. Saving.
Ned!	Ned! Ned, wait up!
Ned's run off into the desert!	Ned!
Ah-ha -- a sand horse! Car of the desert!	Ned's run off into the desert!
There's sand in my shoe!	Flanders! Stupid Flanders!
THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY / AND HUNGRY AND HORNY / BUT MOSTLY JUST THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY...	This looks like a job for... the messiah!
Water!	THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY / AND HUNGRY AND HORNY / BUT MOSTLY JUST THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY...
So salty... Maybe if I... add a little salt...	Water!
Chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?	You have been chosen, Homer.
Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato.	Rise and listen, my child...yours is a great destiny.
I am more than alive, woman! I am the Chosen One who shall unite all the faiths of the Holy Land! I am... the messiah!	Oh Homie, you're alive!
Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.	But you still have our passports, right?
The messiah! Has the passports.	Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.
I'm more than okay! I am the Messiah, come to save the world! Look upon me and shudder!	Dad, are you okay?
As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins.	Uh... Messiah... do you mind if I have a word with your wife?
The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!	"Hmm... Dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" And only one site is sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews -- The Dome of the Rock!"
"This one says ""Carolina Panthers!"""	The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!
Messiah says !	"This one says ""Carolina Panthers!"""
Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews.	I'm pushy?! Please. You stay there surrounded by your great enemy, Canada. Try Syria for two months, then we'll see who's pushy.
Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!	I did it! I reached him!
Spread the word! Peace and chicken!	In a soup you can boil it!
Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in.	Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth.
Can I buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?	Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in.
How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?	I'd like that.
They have malls on land?	You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
Woo hoo!	...and so our Employee of the Month is the late Roger Ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. Moving on. The Power Plant's first annual Fourth of July picnic is this coming Saturday!
I say Burns owes us a party. Let's have one, right now, with his wine!	Burns -- what an ungrateful jerk! We hoofed our hearts out for him -- with no rehearsal!
I'm pounding Melchizedeks!	That's a regular-sized bottle. I'm drinkin' Jeroboams.
Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!	Homer, that's a sixty thousand dollar bottle!
Yeah, you're right.	Yeah, but don't some of that go to income tax?
The government. Taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.	Yeah, you're right.
Uh... this is my lunch.	And just what might that be?
But--	Really? Okay, eat your lunch.
Eat my lunch?	You said it's your lunch. Eat it.
Okay, I will!	Yes! Enjoy!
You don't think I'm going to?	They continued for some time in this vein, until...
Okay.	I don't see any chewing!
There's always a catch.	Well the catch is, happy workers are productive workers.
Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!	It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill our ants.
Please tell me they suffered.	Dad, before you jump to conclusions...
G-g-g-g-hags!	Please tell me they suffered.
"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back."	No can do, baby. I'm not comin' down for days.
Use that image any way you want.	"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back."
Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.	To Mr. Smithers! / Hooray!
Smithers. What a marshmallow.	Yes, the service on my car was excellent. Five out of five. Four out of five. Five out of five. Um, excuse me, can I go back and change that four out of five to five out of five? I'm wasting your time?
I don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!	Smithers. What a marshmallow.
I do, but I'm not going to it.	You told me you did.
Ooh! We mock your very decency.	You know, I used to wonder why Mr. Burns hated humanity. Now I know. You open your heart and they mock your very decency!
Well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation.	Man, Smithers is workin' us like dogs!
I never thought I'd say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back.	Instead of releasing hounds, he releases wolverines!
Burns, you're coming with us.	Oh God, oh God!
The war is over and the future won. The past never had a chance, man!	Yeah. And they've replaced parking meters with this thing you stick your credit card into.
Better lie low, my sweet red friend.	No food allowed in bank?
Community service? But... that's work! What about jail?	Homer Simpson, for causing a panic in the bank, you are hereby sentenced to one hundred hours of community service.
No! I wanna go to jail! Free food! Teardrop tattoos! Library books that come to youuu!	Community service!
I'll serve anything but the communityyy!	No! I wanna go to jail! Free food! Teardrop tattoos! Library books that come to youuu!
Just my lunch.	Hey, whatcha packin', Simpson?
Chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm...	Just my lunch.
Shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything.	Chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm...
Awwww, want a bite?	My wife only parms on my birthday. And that's only if I give her the sad puppy-dog look.
Do you ever wear your police pants to regular things?	There was cocaine in there! I won't last an hour!
From fast food to fine dining?	Throw a jean jacket on top of these babies and you can go anywhere.
Oh yeah. All the time. They say it's 'cause I'm overweight.	Ever stop breathing when you're asleep?
That's some big underwear.	"Overweight? You? Oh now that's crazy. Now me, I have to get my underwear specially made by this village in the Ukraine. They call me ""Daddy Round-Round."" Send me a Christmas card every year."
Okay. Ever been to Moe's?	Uh Simpson, hold on a sec. Um... You wanna uh... Uh, I don't know, get a beer sometime, uh...
Oh yeah -- sorry I was such a jerk about it.	Uh, Earth to Homer -- I arrested you there last month.
I'm there every day, five to eleven.	Aw, now, who could blame you? Your sports team lost. Yeah. Well I'll see you at Moe's.
Oh man, this is so awesome! I can't believe I'm having breakfast where the cops do.	Oh my God, he likes me! Officer up! Officer way, way up!
Aw dang! I lost track of time! I'm gonna be late for work.	Yeah, and you can feel good about eating here too, because all the cooks are ex-cons getting a second chance.
Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.	No you won't. Follow me.
Want some sugar?	Hey Homer, hand me my coffee.
Impressive.	No, no, I got it.
"Hey, would it be okay if I uh... ""ran a make"" on myself?"	Impressive.
"Drunk and disorderly? That's a little redundant. Hey, uh, mind if I do a little ""spring cleaning?"""	G'ahead.
Really? Me?	Listen Homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world?
Chief... me too.	Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. Civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. That's why our friendship is so special to me.
No...	Ever worry the sun's not going to come back after it goes down at night?
Hey, Ralph's a good kid. And he should be, he's got a great Dad.	Uh, me neither. But, but you know who does? Ralphie. Got a lot of worries, that kid: What if the bed wets him? What if Superman decided to kill everybody?
Ooh, ooh! Can I cuff him?!	I guess we should go.
Is he gonna be okay?	Uh-oh.
Oops.	Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. And I'll be there for him.
Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer.	Oops.
Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of...	You see?
You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.	Homer... what happened to me?
Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now?	You missed the wakeup. That's all that counts.
Well, if you really want me to stay...	Now? But I just woke up.
Fine! I'll stay a little more.	No, no. You do what you have to do. Live your life. Which I saved.
Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.	Homer, where you been the last few weeks?
"Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""	"Well, well, well. So this is the ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" reunion that Andrew McCarthy himself was going to attend."
Hey man, you planted that!	World's worst friend.
Everything.	You mugs'll never take me alive, see.
I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.	Any idea where he might be?
Hey, Chief. I uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket.	I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.
Well, I was kind of ungrateful. You did save my life.	I'm sorry, Homer. If I hadn't been so needy, we wouldn't be in this trunk.
We're not gonna get whacked. Because you're Chief Clancy Wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this.	Well, at least we got to be friends again -- y'know, before we got whacked.
No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real.	You have that much faith in me?
I know just the guy.	Well said, Lou. Oh Homer, you want to take out the police copter and hassle people with the spotlight?
Flanders! Wake up! Take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured.	I know just the guy.
Now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa.	Okily dokily.
No, ice cold.	Hot cocoa?
Look at this electric bill! I'm not made of money! I'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!	/ What's going on?
It's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. Lamp, computer, Jacob's Ladder...	Look at this electric bill! I'm not made of money! I'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
How long has this been running?	It's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. Lamp, computer, Jacob's Ladder...
Are you calling me fat?	Dad, while I agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle.
Hmm... Alternative Energy Expo. Where there's expos, there's free Frisbees! Let's roll. But we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out.	No... I am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy.
Yeah, so is getting a real job.	Solar power is a bright idea!
A churro you can eat in the shower?	Dad! I found what you're looking for!
Well, I'm not usually one to take the word of a Dane... plus, how can I afford it?	Goddag, friendlys! Behold to you -- wind! The energy that powers Denmark.
Months?	Well, there are tax credits, government rebates... it will pay for itself in twelve to eighteen...
Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal.	Lifetimes.
I'm starting to regret it already.	Lars, get the twine! You will not regret this!
Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good. Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?	Dad, you are leading the way in clean energy.
Oh my goodness! It means we're traveling back in time! I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!	It's making our meter run backwards!
Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!	Dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company.
Hello, local utility? You greedy bastards have gouged Homer Simpson for the last time.	Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!
The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!	We will cancel your account, sir.
Gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. The kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!	The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!
Don't worry, I'll go see what's wrong!	"""O'er the ramparts we"" what?!"
What the? Who turned off the wind?	Don't worry, I'll go see what's wrong!
Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently.	Dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still.
The wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. Check it out, gang.	My smoothie is a lumpy!
But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!	"Homer, this meeting of your ""fan club"" is adjourned!"
You used to be nicer!	But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
Now we're cookin' with wind!	Kent's Weather Worriers are reporting gusts up to seventy-five...
Nothing is ever right for you.	Homie, maybe this is too much electricity.
Be careful! If you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation.	We're gonna go check out the wind damage!
We'll have to eat Thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!	Our wedding china's ruined.
All right -- let me get my tool belt.	Hey, Mom... Dad... there's a whale on the beach... You've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!
Man, who are these belts made for, French supermodels?	All right -- let me get my tool belt.
Sure. Lisa, bring the car around.	Homie, can I talk to you for a second?
Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?	But I don't know how to drive.
Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison.	We can't let Lisa get her hopes up.
Ooh, it's dinner time!	Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison.
But that would make a great movie.	Ooh, it's dinner time!
That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself.	Lisa is very sensitive. If something she loves dies in front of her--
Coming!	That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself.
Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water.	Coming!
Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.	Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water.
One, two, three, tug!	It's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
It was my idea to put the whale in the water.	Operation Desert Ocean is a go! Let's get this lady fish into the blue zone!
Don't worry, honey. Right now she's lying on God's beach.	Oh no.
Oh Lisa, I'm sorry. I tried my best. I know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect.	She doesn't like lying on the beach! She likes being in the ocean!
I'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! Lisa, where were we?	Not perfect?! You can say that again.
Of course.	Maybe I should just be alone a little bit.
It kills me to see her like that. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's being killed.	Of course.
Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog.	Boston Legal!
Aw, look. He's doing his business.	Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog.
Hey! Not on the rug! You bad dog! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop biting my leg! Ow! Alright, that's it! You're going outside!	Aw, look. He's doing his business.
Bad dog! Stop!	Hey! Not on the rug! You bad dog! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop biting my leg! Ow! Alright, that's it! You're going outside!
Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!	Bluella?
Nature is a toothless dying hag! We are gonna save those whale babies!	Those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. I guess it's just nature's way.
I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!	Dad? Where did you get that boat?
Shark week just got cancelled.	I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!
Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!	Drop the 'poon!
You like sharks?	Did you know that over forty million sharks are slaughtered every year to make shark-fin soup?
Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!	Linda, please.
Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder...	They're right. If the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, I can't let you do it.
Ooh, a baby whale. My diet is working.	Dad! The sharks must think you're a baby whale!
Thanks, buddy!	It's the baby whales' dad!
Hey, I'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which I mean you.	Thanks for not letting me give up, Dad.
Absolutely. He's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. They'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. But if I'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way.	Do you think they'll be okay?
I want some of that!	"Now, who wants...beer cozies! A shirt that says ""Yo!"" Sassy seat cushions! And Flash drives for your P.C. so you can take your data and back it up!!!"
Guess what company had a giveaway at Moe's last night?	And now, Duffman has a dinner date with his estranged daughter! Must not bring up why she dropped out of college! It's too sad!
Keep guessing...	No. I won't.
What's it say, boy?	Keep guessing...
Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.	Ooh. That's a Bingo.
I'll have to check it out sometime.	I've had better. Down at the train station.
Mmm.	I'll have to check it out sometime.
I am pretty full.	Now the best mac and cheese I've ever had is at a bowling alley in Ogdenville.
I'm on my way!	Breadcrumbs on the top.
Golf ball-sized hail!	Partly sunny!
Woo-hoo!	A chance of severe thunder storms with golf ball-sized hail!
/	Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
All right! All right!	/
I'm goin' home. It's not safe in here.	All right! All right!
Hey boy, whatcha doing?	Boy cheeks!... Fanny!... Derriere!... Hiney!... Backside!... ...Cover up that coin slot!
My little Einstein.	Experimenting with my butt.
Well, uh... The one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so I'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?	Homer, Maggie has to wear that clown mask for Halloween. What's going on?
Remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? Well, now I can afford a motorcycle!	I don't see what's so wonderful.
Who wants feet steak?	This building cut me off!
Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!	De-meat those feet!
"Everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""Don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""Don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!"""	I'm standin' right here!
Later. Later.	But you promised!
You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil.	This used to be just a little part of me.
God created the devil? Finally, He did something cool.	I guess I did create this... like God created the devil.
Well, if you ask me, you were trying to play God.	I never wanted to turn into Big Brother. I just wanted to be Little Sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place.
You can help me take out those cameras.	That's the worst sin of all for some reason! What can I do to make things right?
Moe's leaving town?!	One of our wives is leaving us for Moe?!
I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach.	You guys should go on that cruise. You'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father...
Cleaning the gutters?	And I can spend my Mother's Day taking care of something I've been putting off for a long time.
Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!	That's something you've been putting off.
So, Marge, what were we talking about?	Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!
Sorry, honey. I wasn't listening. And I won't be listening now.	Why do I waste my breath?
Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything.	"Hey Homer, what do you think Mom meant by ""taking care of something?"""
I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing.	Dad! That's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hungry, there's lobster!	I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing.
Moe is running off with one of our wives?!	Where are you?
I got Marge!	No battery?!
Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!	Homer?
You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!	Homer? I'm-- you!
Aw dammit!	We're breaking up!
Can't talk! Must text!	Homer?
Marge, have u left me 4...	Can't talk! Must text!
Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore.	I'm, uh, I'm sure you do.
What?	Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore.
Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them.	Homer my Mother's party's starting any minute. Get busy.
Marge, this is crazy!	"Sorry Homer, I ain't servin' no liquor. Just ""O'Glums"" non-alcohol beer."
Flanders?!	Knock-a-doodle-you!
All right.	Take our picture.
What the--	I wasn't smiling!
Why you--	I had something in my teeth.
Lousy--	My eyes were shut.
You take that back!	Except setting off car alarms with his big fat footsteps.
Go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!	Yay!
I'm doomed.	...oh, man do I make the soup. My goodness do I make the soup.
Uh... I do.	Hours later, she returned -- smelling of beer and pickled eggs. I know no more.
I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being my usual effervescent self...	You do?! Tell me!
I don't know.	Then what happened?
Yeah, Padre. How innocuous are your flashbacks?	Well, how can you be so sure your wife is not the putty in the bartender's hands?
The ferry will be back in ten minutes. It'll take us home... to find out the truth.	Well... I... uh...
Today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous.	I'm still mad at you from last night.
Otto, you got to get us back to town!	Dad, I'm gonna need some help getting this off.
She's packing her bag!	Here it comes. The moment of truth.
Thirty-nine.	So it is you, Mr. Homer. But let's be honest -- a woman of her age married to a man of-- how old are you? Sixty-five?
Marge! No! Stop packing your--	Dear God, this day gets more and more disturbing.
Painting supplies?!	Marge! No! Stop packing your--
You're not leaving me?	What do you think?
Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best thing that never happened to me.	It's that Patty and Selma. There's something evil about them. Did you know they smoked when I was pregnant?
Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both.	And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
Why should I? The city's broke! They can't afford to enforce their precious laws!	Homie, slow down!
Cookies... so delicious... must buy house.	Oh come on. What kind of big fat moron would fall for...
Marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!	Homer, no!
...initial the radon disclosure... and done.	Marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
But my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!	Sorry, someone else has bought the house.
Man, you're good with the tools when you want to be.	Side-what-whom?
"Or Frasier on ""Frasier."""	"A lot of people sound like Sideshow Bob, like Frasier on ""Cheers."""
Stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette.	Sideshow Bob!
Nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.	Ice cream!
Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again.	Good. That'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
It's like you're a Chinese empress!	I'll prove I'm telling the truth! Bob has huge feet, right? Well, look!
And I'm not a locksmith!	I'm not a writer.
Man, that dude does not like Bart.	And I'm not a locksmith!
Mexico! Andalé! Andalé! Arriba!	Yeah I've seen him. He... uh... said he was driving down to Mexico.
Help us! Help us, for the love of God! Won't somebody help us?!	Hey! Hey no!
Uh yes, I'd like... um... how do you say taco in Mexican?	Si?
Yes, that's exactly the word I want to translate.	Taco.
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it.	Homer, can we please find Bart?
Stop! Stop! Stop!	"Glad to say it, and now the girls will ""yay"" it!"
That is disgusting.	Stop! Stop! Stop!
Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.	So, do we have a winner?
Oh my God.	I think I've come up with the answer.
You never fail to nauseate me, boy.	Oh my God.
I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you.	Just call me Barf Simpson.
Half an hour to show time, your ugliness.	I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you.
But if we win this, we get a gift certificate.	Dad, do you realize we've put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined?
It doesn't matter.	For what?
Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--	You're home early!
Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do?	Moe's is closed, huh?
Okay.	We can enjoy each others' company.
Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I'd help you cook dinner.	I didn't see you come in.
Now that I have all this free time, I thought I would do you a huge favor.	Ah they all suck. But here's a great one about Alabama!
I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker...	That's nice. What kind of favor?
And I also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!	I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker...
Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar.	Good day to you.
Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! Oh yeah!	"Well, it's been such a... blessing having you around the house, ""making my life easier,"" as you so put it, so I thought you deserved a reward."
Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas?	What was the greatest X.F.L. team that never won a championship?
Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. So, I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went.	Homie! I thought you were at that sports bar.
Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you for parts and labor? Pick one, buddy! I can do this just fine by myself.	In the mood for another round?
Don't worry, I got it!	Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you for parts and labor? Pick one, buddy! I can do this just fine by myself.
Marge! You ruined my shot!	Hooked for life...
That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods of sex.	Well you can take another -- in forty years!
Oooh, the Nobies!	We're watching the Nobel Prize announcements, live from Stockholm!
Lucky.	Huzzah! I had him in the pool!
I would kill for that.	Quiet! It's time for the noblest Nobel Prize of all: the Peace Prize.
Arctic Circle! I just got that!	Hey you, Big Chief Laugh-At-Crap. Meet me in my limo in five minutes.
How easy am I?	All right, all right, settle down. Homer, you're the easiest laugh I know.
Can my son come too? He knows what to do when I swallow my tongue.	Shut up. I'm gonna need you in the audience when I accept the Peace Prize in Oslo.
They fight and bite? I never go to Europe without learning something.	THEY FIGHT AND BITE / THEY FIGHT! AND BITE AND FIGHT / FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! / BITE! BITE! BITE! / THE ITCHY AND SCRATCHY SHOW!
Another good one...	How 'bout that airline food, huh?! They should've called it chicken cordon blecch!
Did you say a Hague?	You are NOT in Oslo. You are in Holland... specifically, The Hague!
Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.	"We don't put ""Euro"" in front of everything. Euro-guards! Take him away in Euro-cuffs!"
Uh, what region is America?	Is it Region One or Region Two?
Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!	Region One.
No fair! We just went to church!	First we're visiting Grampa.
Fifty bucks each?! That's your life savings?!	I just want to see the look on your faces when I share with you the fruits of a lifetime of labor.
HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN...	WHAT DO I DO / WITH THIS DAMN LITTLE MAN / HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN!
Five hundred dollars? That's, like, ten dead Grampas! Some of us stuck to our limit, Marge. And I would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!	Uh-oh-ohhh.
Well, it's a cat -- I'm not sure it's the cat.	Is that the cat in there?!
You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town.	Don't worry, Homer -- I'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow.
After Bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made.	You know, a much nicer table just opened up!
Oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- Wiggum's making his move!	You go ahead, I'll stay here. If I get something on this handbag, I won't be able to return it.
Sure, sure!	Homer! Take me home!
Let me just grab one more shrimp.	Sure, sure!
I believe this stranger!	I'd like to return this handbag. Unused.
Check and mate.	Well, here's your refund.
Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?	Thank God! I will never do that again.
You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund.	Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?
"Hide a sandwich in this hat. ""Mary Poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella."	You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund.
Yeah, the luck lasts longer! Thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!	Homie, you know what happens when you push your luck...
Come in. Come in. Don't wipe your feet.	Ma, please, you're not at work.
I wish. What the hell are you doing?!	Did you find a mouse head in your Cuppa-Soup?
Now, everyone onto the hot tub.	"With this protective plastic overlay, I can't tell if I'm watching an old ""Seinfeld"" or an old ""Old Christine."""
Come on on, the cardboard's fine.	Now, everyone onto the hot tub.
Good afternoon. I'd like to return this merchandise. Wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain.	Yes, well, you see the thing about that is...
Yes... uh... maybe I'll just come back during someone else's shift... Is Claire working today? She's a real sucker.	Sir, this suitcase has an airline tag on it, these ping-pong balls have been served and volleyed, and this hot plate's still warm.
How do you know my name?	Hello, Homer.
It's not what you think... I came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um...	"I'm Chris Hansen from ""To Catch A Credit-Whore"". We know you've been returning used items all over town."
Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!	People like you?
I have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?	Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!
Initial there, and... Never!	I have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?
Can you tell me when this is gonna be on? I'm thinking of having a party.	Initial there, and... Never!
Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?	Anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased.	Homie, maybe you could do it.
That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy.	You know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them.
Hey pal, howya doin'?	Hey, Dad.
Hey, let's hold hands and skip inside!	Wow, I'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport.
Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!	Here's my uniform, since I won't be needing it any more!
I'll put a stop to this nonsense!	Cut it out! You're upsetting the gravy boat!
Sorry Marge, I gotta call bullcrap on that. The '69 Mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids? Not me -- and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!	Lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? Fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever.
Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles.	What about Bart's feelings?
They sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally.	Why do you say such ridiculous things?
...Then Pete Rose plowed into his friend Ray Fosse...	Mama Bear said 'I'm sure Sister Bear will come to her senses.'
...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...	"Brother Bear said ""Sister Bear is inconsiderate."""
"...He had earned the nickname ""Charlie Hustle..."""	...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
If he makes it, that's my son!	It's the most exciting play in baseball! Go, Bart!
You stink!	The Isotots lose! Now to begin my off-season job: follow-home robberies. I'll see you in the parking lot, but you won't see me, until it's too late.
Ridin' high! Sinkin' low! Top of the heap! Down I go! On top for good! Oh, cruel hubris!	Woo hoo! Another ladder!
Man, it's been a crazy morning. Champagne?	Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Yeah, charts are for squares, baby.	Oh Homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters.
What is it? Lenny, I'm on a second honeymoon. You'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. Now, where were we?	That's my cell phone.
Oh baby. Let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.	What is it? Lenny, I'm on a second honeymoon. You'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. Now, where were we?
Fine, I'll get the hook.	Homie, help him up!
Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?	Fine, I'll get the hook.
You're safe now, my friend.	Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?
O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know...	He's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
Fine. I'm going for a walk.	I'm not really in the mood anymore.
Hey, I've had a hard trip too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses.	Poor man. You've been through so much.
Marge, can I have a word with you in private?	God, it was horrible!
I don't trust that guy. I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.	Marge, can I have a word with you in private?
Why do pie makers get all the girls?	That is so sweet!
It was poisoned.	Why did you do that?
Well, it was rhubarb.	No it wasn't!
Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!	No, it was berry-peach!
Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!	The pie was poisoned. You were right! I guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
"They should call this one ""recipe for murder."""	Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!
Never mind.	What do you mean, this one?
Ooh, got a text.	Oh Roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?
Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea.	Dear God. We just killed a man.
Come 'n' get it barnacles!	Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea.
This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them!	Roger was telling the truth!
Then... his story was true!	Low sodium!
Hey pal, how ya been?	Well, if it isn't my saviors.
The pie you baked us killed that shark!	"Don't you ""pal"" me. Why did you try to kill me?!"
We had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him.	Why did you do that?
Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.	Yes, I suspected our host would poison us, so I gave everyone an antidote before dinner.
Oh, come on! Just a second...	Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
Bankers away!	Oh, come on! Just a second...
Marge, what are you doing? That pie is poisoned!	We'll know.
She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!	I can't live with the guilt.
Ever wonder what she thinks about?	She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!
I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow.	Edmund's almost here, so PLEASE nobody be themselves!
I get the drumstick!	Dinner is served. I tried to make what Homer said you liked.
Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?	I get the drumstick!
Okay, okay. If you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?	Yes.
Man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day...	Get them back -- she can't get neck-holes! It's picture day tomorrow!
Boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is.	Green! Green! Green! Boom! Green! Yes! Boom! Green! Good! Boom!
Excuse me?	Boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is.
Have you seen these kids?	Excuse me?
Super-Team -- fly!	There they are!
Hyah! Hyah!	I'm Dracula, not The Hulk.
Back off, you unholy dreamboat!	Too late. The bloodlust is upon me.
Pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.	Back off, you unholy dreamboat!
Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?	Yes, but at least you are safe, my son.
Come and get it.	Well, nobody loves his kids more than me!
And not the good kind!	His blood! It's full of cholesterol!
Woo-hoo!	And not the good kind!
Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!	Uh, Dad? They turned you into a vampire.
Nooooo!	Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!
Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions.	Don'tcha want her beyond all reason?
No child of mine will go without anything, ever! Except quality healthcare!	"Dad, I think Maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""Baby Must-Have."""
You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.	Pick a box -- you get what you get.
I'll take... that one.	You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
Aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!	I'll take... that one.
You're lucky you're behind glass.	I can't give you another toy till you buy another ten gallons of gas.
Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!	Ain't no glass.
Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!	You have a good day.
Woo hoo!	Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
Oh I'm sorry, Maggie, but even at your age, I'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... I can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!	Oh Homie, maybe we should call it a day.
The march of progress.	Ooo, everything's changed! That tree used to be a smaller tree. And that food bank used to be a regular bank.
Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.	"Well, stop in and say ""hi"" to me 'cause I'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad."
Just don't dress me up like a woman.	As long as I can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every Halloween.
"Tell her ""no deal""."	Well, as long as we don't have to feed this one.
What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?	Dad, can I talk to you for a second?
"Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their ""Homer."""	Well, um, I was looking through Mom's old schoolwork, and I noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you.
It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die.	No offense Dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams.
Oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. G'night.	That's odd. Lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
No, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. Goodnight!	She doesn't want to end up like me?!
Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain.	What's so wrong with me?
She does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!	Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain.
Well, if you check your purse I think you'll find... the seven of clubs!	I remember everything.
I am so sorry, Marge.	No. Just a picture of Lisa. Who wants to be nothing like me.
Ta-da!	The seven of clubs.
That would be one weird-looking kid.	Mom, Dad! Please, can I go here? I'll study so hard I'll make the old me look like Bart.
"Oh, I've seen that look before. That's the ""I ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look."	Mom, please don't.
Run!	You what?!
Thank you, four-eyes!	I have a future! Thank you, Mom!
Thank you.	Um, eight o'clock.
Your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. So, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you sweet dreams.	That school is so great! Teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. Is Mom gonna come up and say goodnight?
Look what Maggie got!	I'm so glad you two are friends again.
Up, a father has his secrets.	Homer? How did you get...?
Hurry up, boy. We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid.	You know, I don't know when this was ever a good idea.
All right. We'll get the vaccine.	They have a vaccine!
I thought he was an old clump of rags.	Homer, did you know he was in the pile?
Why did Burns make us all come here?	No. It's better that they hear it from me. I'll tell them the truth in the simplest way I know how.
Hell yeah!	The truth is... I'm dying.
Or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!	I hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes.
Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with.	Hm, apparently Mr. Burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent.
Marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you.	Just because Mr. Burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless.
Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will.	What do you think I am, a thousand years old? I got a myPod full of Lee Greenwood.
Amen.	This town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge.
Okay, Burnsie, follow the carrot!	Amen.
Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end.	Dad, you're gonna wreck him for everybody!
Where's the other girder?	Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end.
Already?	Dad, Mr. Burns is here for you again.
Yeah, I've done all I can do in that medium.	A little tired of revenge, are we?
You're welcome!	It wasn't kindness that was keeping me alive, it was bile building up inside! Loathing is my life blood and rage my royal jelly! So yes, thank you, Springfield, for giving me the secret to eternal life -- hate!
And so The Bloody Hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey.	Oh, don't be scared, boys. That's just the angels bowling.
KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / I'M AFTER YOU / WITH MY BLOODY NOOSE / STRONG ENOUGH TO HANG TEN MOOSE / KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / IT'S JUST A STORY, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE!	And so The Bloody Hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey.
No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London...	Homer, are you scaring those kids?
Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs.	You said it was Boston.
Possibly!	Like those chairs in the music room?
Ker-shaw, ker-shew, my lies have come true!	The Hangman's here!
All finished, boy.	My mom ran off with my birthday clown.
Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.	That coop looks a little flimsy.
Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?	Wow, Ray, you have hidden talents!
Way ahead of you.	No, I was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth.
You can race pigeons?	Hey Homer, you ever think about racing that bird?
Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty...	Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?
Danica Patrick in my thoughts!	Congratulations, Homer.
Ended that a little too soon.	You Brickyard Bimbo!
What they don't suspect is that I'm into this.	Ended that a little too soon.
Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!	Dad! Help!
Come on out, birdie! Follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice.	Nooooo!
"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers..."""	You haven't earned the right to say that to me.
Stupid dog!	"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers..."""
Marge, listen to the man -- he pays Bart's salary.	How can you say a thing like that?
Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!	No he doesn't!
A shrink who takes kids and pets?	Bart, Santa's Little Helper, come on in.
Even my tramp stamp?	Hey, in this economy, I'll even remove tattoos.
I got the idea from a show where people regret these.	Even my tramp stamp?
Oh baby! Well whaddaya know! Oh come on!	Homie, why don't you study these?
Nicely done, boy.	So, Bart, as the one with the larger brain...
Oh, that's pretty sure. Subscription rate, right?	As sure as I am that I'll be billing you for that torn magazine.
Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire.	What about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.	"Well, ""ditching"" is a harsh word."
It was still too much.	It wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches.	We'll take good care of your dog.
Maybe we should get going.	I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches.
Marge, I'm watching a rerun of an important Bowl game.	Bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?
I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.	"Well, boy, I guess this is it. We've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption ""Who's Walking Who?"""
Ooo, unknown caller!	I'd like a moment to ourselves.
Hey!	Ooo, unknown caller!
All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt.	Hey!
You said nobody gets hurt. Those were your exact words!	All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt.
Well, Bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner.	Well, boy, I guess I owe you an apology. Who's a bird-eating monster? You are. You are! Yes you are!
Maggie.	And that last touchdown makes it sixty-seven to thirteen.
Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that.	You mean your gingerbread McMansion.
I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go.	Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that.
You're gonna be okay.	I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go.
It's almost over.	You're gonna be okay.
Now to take care of the witnesses.	It's almost over.
I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.	Hey, Simpson! How come you ain't in combat like a real man?!
Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead I grew this tree!	I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want a Christmas ham.	Don't dare bring that thing in here!
Sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could.	So I never want to see another Christmas tree... until Mom comes back, safe and sound.
Why couldn't it have been me?	See? Every time we get a tree, Mom disappears!
Shut up.	It still could be. You just have to go down to the recruiting station and--
Whose turn is it to cry?	Yeah. My only sale all year and it's not even a sale.
Look at that picture!	Quitcher bellyaching about Marge and let me read the paper.
Someday TV will be invented, and it will be free. Then it will cost money.	Yes, but then I learned that there's always hope. Someday this war will be over. Someday our Mom will be back.
Now remember, pack only necessities.	Now this... is a challenge.
Now we just have to make it.	We brought you breakfast in bed!
YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED / WHEN THE O.J. IS FRESHLY-SQUEEZED / AND TOAST IS MADE FROM HOMEMADE	...EVERYWHERE YOU GO
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT FOR BREAKFAST / WE'LL GO OUT TO EAT / IT'LL BE ANY PLACE YOU CHOOSE / AS LONG AS IT'S RUN BY JEWS / 'CAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THIS HOLIDAY'S SO GREAT.	YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED / WHEN THE O.J. IS FRESHLY-SQUEEZED / AND TOAST IS MADE FROM HOMEMADE
ALOHA'OE / ALOHA'OE... Hurry up, kids! We gotta get to the airport!	WE'RE GONNA GO OUT FOR BREAKFAST / WE'LL GO OUT TO EAT / IT'LL BE ANY PLACE YOU CHOOSE / AS LONG AS IT'S RUN BY JEWS / 'CAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THIS HOLIDAY'S SO GREAT.
Now nothing stands between us and sunny Hawa...	Hey, get this off! Hey, get this off!
Ai-yi-yi-yi!	Merry Humbug, everyone!
I got the week off by telling Mr. Burns I had a neck injury!	What's wrong, Homie?
Mr. Burns, why'd you come to see me?	I got the week off by telling Mr. Burns I had a neck injury!
Uh... uh...	Wait, what's this? Carpetbags and portmanteaus? Going somewhere, Simpson?
Coming!	Simpson! Where's your Christmas tree?
Fine, I'll come clean.	Just what's going on here?
No, it's not. I just told a lie so we could go to Hawaii.	It's a Christmas miraculum!
Sh!	We did that one already!
C'mon, jus' one more drink, Marge.	There is only one upside to today.
Sweetie, relax. Let's just watch some TV.	I know when the freakin' Fiesta Bowl is!
Huh? What'd I do?	Well, well, well. Simpson, you've committed Springfield's first crime of the new year. Write him up, Lou.
Fifty bucks?! That used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!	Failed to separate your bottles and newspapers.
What the hell?!	That's vandalizing city property! Write him up again, Lou.
C'mon, Lou. Gimme a break!	Mild obscenity before ten a.m. Also illegal.
Since when is all this against the law?	Sorry, sir, I take no pleasure in it. Oh yeah.
This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.	Since today. As of Jan one, a bunch of new ordinances -- with uh, outrageous financial penalties -- took effect.
Oh, I get it. The government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy.	This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.
That's almost a thousand dollars!	"Fine. You're ""Tellin' it like it is."" Also a crime now. And that one's gonna cost ya."
Ten minutes? I can't wait that long! I left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!	Homer, what you do is go down to window nine at the courthouse. You slip the guy a hundred bucks and your record is as clean as... uh, I ain't got nothin' clean to compare it to.
"Chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. I meant to write ""bride."" It's a wedding present."	Homer Simpson, you are under arrest for attempted bribery of a public official.
My bribe!	Oh, how thoughtful!
It's okay, it's okay. I can be out in eighteen months with good behavior.	Homer Simpson, you are hereby sentenced to ten years in the Federal Penitentiary!
Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!	We're Simpsons, Dad. We don't do good behavior.
Your honor, I would like to request a sidebar.	Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!
All that time I'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise...	Ten years. That is a long time to be away from your family.
I repeat: unable to exercise...	Actually, most convicts work out like crazy.
What? This guy?	"Simpson, we are currently conducting a twenty-year investigation into the activities of Anthony ""Fat Tony"" D'Amico."
I can't go undercover with Fat Tony. He's met me. I've been in his house. I was briefly his Consiglieri... Consugly... Canolli... Robert Duvall.	We're gonna plant you in Fat Tony's gang as an undercover informant.
Can I be Johnny Undercover?	So we're gonna plant you in the prison with a disguise and a new name.
Okay, Melvin Mafia.	That's a little obvious.
Can I keep the name after I'm done?	"No, you will be known as Nicky ""Blue Pants"" Altosaxophony."
Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!	Now pay attention. We're gonna move in on Fat Tony when he takes delivery on a shipment of Belgian guns. In your left sideburn is a fiber-optic camera. In your right, a wireless mic. To zoom in you go ayyyyy! To zoom out go ohhh!
Fuhgetaboutit!	Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!
Uh, what's my name again?	Keep him safe from shanks and shivs. Let him become rich in the jailyard currencies of cigarettes and dried fish...
Okay, I'm comin'.	Uh, what's my name again?
I'd like a third helping, please.	Okay, I'm comin'.
Just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!	You do know the meat is made from diseased pigeons.
Hey, you're that guy from the F.B.--	Just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
There was barbecue sauce on it.	Time to go to work. Stop licking my hand.
But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.	Here's how it goes down: I rough up Louie. Then you stand up to me, earning his trust.
What's a dime store?	Enough of your dime store morality.
Beating? What beating?	Hey Nicky Blue, you're one tough yegg. If you come out of your beatin' in one piece, you and I should have a face-to-face.
Oh. That beating.	Beating? What beating?
Can I have any of the steaks?	Don't worry. We're not gonna touch you. We'll make it sound like a beating by tenderizing these steaks.
Please! Let me have it! Come on! Give it to me right in the mouth!	Whoa! I'm impressed over here with that guy over there.
Well... back in my keister you go.	Please! Let me have it! Come on! Give it to me right in the mouth!
How're you gonna do that?	Now let us escort you to freedom.
I'll take care of this.	I detect a distinct lack of oregano.
Oregano, basil, rosemary...	You carry oregano with you?
Sorry, boss.	My beloved Anna Maria. I hope Heaven's powder room is painted that eggshell blue you could never achieve on Earth.
Yeah. Those guys are probably FBI informants.	No apology necessary. I am touched. You and me, Nicky, we feel. Legs, Louie, Jimmy the Axe, Tommy the Face Shooter -- they never share my grief.
Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.	You think an informant could get that close to me?
What are we doing here?	That is good counsel, indeed. You have earned my complete, unquestioning trust. But first, one little thing... you must make your bones.
Well, I guess I could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette.	Why you! I'm gonna chop you into pieces and make you into a Rubik's cube, which I will never solve!
Oh no! No! I... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.	What's the matter, Nicky? You got a problem with this job?
My neck is kind of itchy.	Nicky, welcome to the family. From now on, you don't know where you end and we begin. Your problems are our problems.
Huh?	To heterosexual male friendship, the kind the Greeks wrote about.
Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!	All units, move in!
Don't ask questions! Just go!	What? Why?
Ayyyy!	Get a shot of Tony with the guns!
Ayyyy!	Closer...
Ohhhh!	Too close.
Ayyyy.	Closer.
Ohhhh.	Too close.
No! You're wrong! Check again!	He's dead.
So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?	Homer, I just want to say that of all the rat bastards we've had working for us, you were the snitchiest.
Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.	And I'm not gonna shake your hand.
It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach.	Homie, I know you had a terrible experience, but it's over.
Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good.	You never took me to that bar on the beach.
No, no, I oversold it.	Sounds pretty good.
I'd give anything to bring you back.	No, no, I oversold it.
Fat Tony?	Wake up, Homer.
Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising.	No -- I'm his cousin from San Diego, Fit Tony.
I understand. I loved him too.	And there's no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big, fat snitch.
Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there.	Your tears seem in no way crocodilian.
I worked for Fat Tony. And he was the best boss I ever had.	I will let you live for... twenty minutes.
Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too.	Well. This is awkward.
He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.	This is gonna be great! A real rumble! Just like in that movie where the Jets fought the Sharks!
Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.	Homer, it is time... to switch your elliptical machine to cool-down mode.
Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?	No. Because my cousin lives on in your memories. And to extinguish you, would be to whack what still remains of him.
And your enemies closer?	It's pretty screwed-up. That's why I keep my friends close.
Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.	No! Why would I do that? If they were close, they would kill me!
"The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as ""Fit Fat Tony,"" then just ""Fat Tony"" for short."	Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.
And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else.	"The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as ""Fit Fat Tony,"" then just ""Fat Tony"" for short."
Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.	And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else.
And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life.	Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.	Why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen...	It's all yours.
Hm, better check last year's return.	Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen...
Hm.	Hm, better check last year's return.
Been a while since our wives got together, huh?	You know who was really happy to get back together: our husbands.
Ooh, I got a text!	Homer!
Are you gonna open it?	I got a text!
Because you're my best friend in the room.	No, that page isn't optimized for cell phone u... why am I talking to you?
Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's.	Oh, and Homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so I can have a girls' night out?
Stupid Flanders' wi-fi!	Hey, how ya doin', Hom--
This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.	Thanks for the ride!
Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?	Shh!!!
Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.	And Anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? They went to the beach every day!
It's kind of weird, us all being naked in here.	But I don't want a beach house. Sand makes me sad. Because it used to be big rocks. But not anymore. Not anymore...
Right... neither am I.	We're not naked.
Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--	I could light these, but, it wouldn't be the same.
Guess I'll put these tools away. Put 'em on hooks and stuff.	Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--
Can we at least drink beer or something?	Well... Homer got along so well with the other dads, I couldn't break it to him.
Oh, you beautiful man.	Hey-diddily-hi, Homer.
God you're hilarious.	That feeling is Mutual of Omaha.
I don't like those guys.	Hey look, the late shift's leaving.
Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.	Yeah, they think they're better than us just because their performance reviews reflect that fact.
Time to punch in.	That's funny, 'cause I found this candy bar in my desk.
A dinosaur!	Yoink! Yah! Yah!
Huh?	So, uh, what would you gentlemen like? I mean, I know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? Oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? I'm gonna pour some beers now.
He's washing his hands.	Hey, what's that guy doing in the men's room?
Check out my tolerance, Marge. I'm going to use the men's room.	"You know, this is the first time I've ever been at Moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying ""this is not a safe place to drink."""
Hey, I didn't know you were... uh... you know, one of those--	Check out my tolerance, Marge. I'm going to use the men's room.
But you do like comic books.	I am not Comic Book Guy. I am his cousin, Comic Book Gay.
Lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on.	We regret any confusion this may have caused.
Life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.	"Oh no, not ""the face."""
I liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. But the supervising producing was the best I've ever seen.	Life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
Bart, son, if I bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it.	Can I have it, Dad? Can I?
Because when you get anything you want, you don't want anything you get.	Bart, son, if I bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it.
Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.	What is this crap? Are you wearing a wire?
Why you little!!!	Are you kidding? You're the worst dad who ever lived! I'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.	Homer, a good father is strong enough that he doesn't need to use his strength. What Bart needs is for you to strangle him with your love.
Son, I won't strangle you anymore, but I also won't get you that mini-bike.	Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
Wish I could, son. I really wish I could.	How 'bout this? I let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.
Bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but I didn't think it was the right thing to do.	What's wrong, Homie?
Marge, not in front of the refrigerator.	Bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but I didn't think it was the right thing to do.
Well in that case, Lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so I opened the drapes to let in more sun.	There's nothing sexier than a man being a good Dad. Whoa!
Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward.	"Dad, if I get an ""A"" on my math test, would that be worth some money?"
And if you do it, son, you'll get the same.	Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward.
That's great.	"I did it! I got an ""A""!"
Son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work.	Uh, Dad. If we could get to the reward...?
Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends.	What the? I wanted a mini-bike! I told all my friends I was getting one!
Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break.	Yes they were! But now they won't be! Because I don't have a mini-bike!
But it could use a button. Oh, what if I said... Well if you...	Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break.
Can't lose that. It's the best picture of me I have.	Mister Homer, you inadvertently left your nuclear plant security badge in the birthday card rack.
Yeah, I do know a lot about nuclears.	Well, I am more concerned with global terrorism. America's enemies would give anything for your nuclear knowledge.
"Marge, would you like a ""Thicker Than Waters"" collectible plate?"	...so I'm offering to trade your country nuclear secrets for a mini-bike. Concludingly yours, Bart Simpson.
Oh yeah? I'll show you.	Homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. It's twenty-five years old.
"""TV Guide Offer, One World Trade Center..."""	Oh yeah? I'll show you.
Awww...	Dad, I was thinking about it and... you're right. You shouldn't buy me something I didn't earn. And because you gave me the tough love I didn't know I needed, I'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you.
And I love having you here, son. 'Cause you can wake me up if somebody comes.	I love visiting you at work, Dad.
Let's see if this works.	Check this out, Bart. One of those retinal scan dealies. It only opens to my eye or an exact copy.
Damn, that hurt!	Let's see if this works.
I'll just use my eye.	Damn, that hurt!
Because you've been such a great kid lately and I wanted to show you I appreciated it.	No! Why in the world would you get me this?
Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy.	I've got summer squash!
Where is he going?	Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old TV show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy.
Why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?	Where is he going?
Step away from the traitor!	A teddy bear made in China!
The boy's flash drive may be in there. But I've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.	Dad!
I know what you're saying! I understand food talk in every language!	Kě-shì wǒ-men néng xìn de guò tā huì bǎ hǎo-chī-de song-guò-lái ma?
Um... I'll see myself out.	American fatso, your knowledge helped us build this plant. We would like you to have the honor of cutting the ceremonial ribbon.
Okay, who can take me to the airport for less than twenty dollars? I can stand here all day.	Um... I'll see myself out.
My feet hurt.	Okay, who can take me to the airport for less than twenty dollars? I can stand here all day.
Well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the TV.	You know, Dad, I really did have a good time hanging out with you.
"CHERISH THAT FAMILY SMILE / PICKET FENCE DAYS GO SOMETHING SOMETHING / THE FUTURE IS COMING SOON / MOM AND DAD AND KIDS ARE SOMMMMETHING That's my favorite song now. Sorry ""Don't Fear the Reaper."" Everybody! Air guitar! Come on, do it with me! Use your whammy bar! Whew! Now fuzz it up! Excellent!"	I don't want to talk about my Mom's hair.
Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman.	"Boy, I love Valentine's Day. Stir a drop of Jägermeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry Chapstick, call it ""Cupid's Ambrosia,"" and you can charge up the wazoo."
Do you have plans for tonight?	Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman.
Oh, thank you, prior obligation!	Well, I'm going to tell you my secrets right now...
Drive my kids to school?! Never!	Homer! We only have five minutes until the school bus comes.
Stupid double snuggler's hitch! Only hope is to chew off my leg.	Drive my kids to school?! Never!
Ow! Ow! Huh, mmm, not bad. Just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours.	Stupid double snuggler's hitch! Only hope is to chew off my leg.
Oh Marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties.	My first gray hair!
Well, it's not easy with you talking all the time.	Homie, you always mean to say the nicest things.
So... chicken.	We're running out of time, people! We need an answer! And it needs to be great!
Sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. Let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims.	What do you think, Homie?
What has she done?! I feel like I'm married to Richard Gere!	Sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. Let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims.
I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. What's up?	What has she done?! I feel like I'm married to Richard Gere!
So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia.	I can't take it. I'm just going to draw a hairline on.
The good doctor has just the prescription.	So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia.
You ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?	"""Jumping on the Grenade:"" the wingman engages the less attractive friend, isolating the target."
Yes, that's exactly it!	They're like dimes!
Oh I know.	Well, a girl could starve to death!
So Lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?	"""Taking Down a Rival,"" aka ""Talk Blocking."""
Well, I don't know... it's a lot of work.	Nice talk-blocking. Would you be willing to wingman for me?
Deal!	I just ordered this bottomless pitcher of beer and circumference-less platter of nachos.
I do keep it together.	Oh Homer, I've never seen a drunk hold his vomit like you.
Uh-oh. Usually when it gets this quiet Mr. Burns is standing behind me.	I do keep it together.
Marge? What are you doing here? This bar is for singles and wingmen only.	"This is a situation I call ""The Doctor Is Out."""
Probably.	True beauty isn't about hair color?
"Well, I guess I do have a ""type."""	"But be honest, when I say ""beautiful woman,"" what pops into your head?"
Is my job creating power, empowering?	Oh.
Only my hairdresser knows for sure.	Hey Dad, did you color your hair too?
He's dying in a retirement home. Now kiss me.	Oh hello, young man! Where's your father?
Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!	Bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! Let's get this yo on the road, people!
Okay... I'll take some of... that.	Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!
Mix it in.	Well that's my tip jar!
That's it, boy! I'm eating your yogurt!	I'm bored.
He didn't know that!	You ate his yogurt in the car.
Stupid kid. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting!	He didn't know that!
Wealthy? Hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. Eh?	Is Bart Simpson here? Because I'm about to make him and his family very wealthy!
So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair?	The most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
"I legally forced him to say ""semi""."	"That's ""Angry Dad""! The semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created!"
My little Roman Polanski!	Don't thank me, thank Hollywood for being completely out of good ideas.
What?! What's wrong with being Roman Polanski?	Homer!
He what?...	What?! What's wrong with being Roman Polanski?
You monster!	He what?...
Observe.	Anything you can give us from real life?
More for me.	No thanks.
It would be an honor!	Hey Homer! You want to be the voice of Angry Dad?
"There's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read."""	Thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of Angry Dad will be on a speakerphone today.
"""Family, today I graduate from my anger management class."""	"""'Angry Dad: The Movie.' ""Angry Dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."""
Pained noises.	Angry Dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
Oh okay, uh, Lenny, hit me with that chair.	"No Dad, don't say ""pained noises,"" you make pained noises."
Woo hoo!	"""Condiments"" by Mixar...and Angry Dad."
Angry Dad's voice is part Walter Matthau... Hey, Felix!... part Little Richard Whoooo! ...and a little bit of Snoopy when he cries.	I have many people to thank...
I'd like to thank Mr. Speedy Pants Repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the Bangles. See you at the cool party!	Sound mixers may not be glamorous, but they make us sound so good.
Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?	I'M GOING TO THE OS-CARS! NOT AS A SEAT FILL-ER! I'LL GET A GIFT BAS-KET! BUT I WON'T DE-CLARE IT!
If I find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble.	Uh... nobody. Wrong number.
Uh-oh.	Homer? Well, I don't know. L.A.'s a world-class city with a lot to offer. He's probably enjoying the sights...
Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A.	Say, why ain't you at the Oscars, A.D.?
Hmm... Who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?	That's cold.
I was born a Rollin' Eighty, and I'll die a Rollin' Eighty.	That means if another gang sees you, they'll kill you.
You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit.	This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.
Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay.	We can still order a replacement from the academy, right?
"Oh, hi! Ricky Gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I love your movies. Or as I call them, ""films."" Umm, glad I bumped into you, actually.

I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think?"	Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay.

Well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? Don't take any of my ideas.	This next move is tricky.
Me! Me! I want him every night, and forever and ever! 'Cause I love my--	Okay, we're gonna take turns having Grampa as a roommate. Who wants to go first?
That's great, honey. If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist.	Dad, look! This essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!
Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!	Or I'll make dog-head soup outta ya!
It does!	Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!
And there's something else it might be good for.	It does!
Why are you guys eating so fast?	And there's something else it might be good for.
Uh, you look tense. Let's discuss this over a cup of Grampa's coffee.	Dad, is there anything unusual in Grampa's coffee?
Your kisses feel like raw liver.	Oh thank you, thank you!
Come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! I wanna take Grampa to have his bellybutton pierced.	Turns out it's not. The point is, when I'm cranky, nobody likes me, sweet pea. Let me live as a happy man for my remaining thirty years.
Oh, because Lisa won't tell me what flower it's from.	Homer, why don't you just make some more of the serum yourself?
Yeah. But Lisa won't tell me how to make it.	Quiet. Sir, has your daughter found a drug that renders old people tolerable to us normals?
Nerd.	Jawohl! I've isolated the molecule!
Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.	Oh, don't get me started on that one. They're just plain better than the greats of my day. God bless them, and their refusal to learn English.
Thank you for the tour of your factory, Mister Wonka.	Nice!
Go ahead.	Gentlemen, we've been doing a lot of funny things today, but now I must be scary.
That's what I was gonna call it!	Why you little!
"Oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up."""	Wait, I can't go in there grinnin' like a Swede on payday -- it'll rile up poor Lisa if she knows I'm still poppin' that smiley-pill.
Your grandfather is not a monster.	No, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!
Now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town.	Your grandfather is not a monster.
It better be tonsillitis.	Bart, why are you tugging on your collar?
So, I guess we're all in the same boat, huh?	Who loves mommy's eyeballs? Oh there's a kitty gonna sleep good tonight! Yes you are!
Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!	/ What? Well I never!
Flat tire? No problem!	Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!
Great idea, but I don't have any money.	Homer, use your head. Just buy a new car!
And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?	You could take out a loan with your house as collateral.
Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!	Pretty close to zero, I'd say.
Cheech and Chong are coming back to Springfield?	Springfield natives Cheech and Chong are returning in triumph for a reunion show!
Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!	Who the hell are Cheech and Chong?
I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!	Who are Beavis and Butthead?
He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!	Oh man, I gotta get rid of my grass!
Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times.	He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
Hide the dope!	What are you guys doing up there?
Then what did I just smoke?	We don't have any dope.
I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!	It's me, Dave, man. Open up, I got the stuff.
Dave's not here! Dave's not here!	"Ooo, he's gonna say ""Dave's not here!"""
Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.	Well, how about this? Chong's not here! Man!
I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals.	Homie, you know all the bits. Maybe you could help him!
Dave's not here, man!	Homer Simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. Help him!
Dave?	No man, I'm Dave. D-A-V-E!
Dave's not here, man!	That's right. Now open up the door.
I'll give Dave your message.	Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers...
My time being wasted was not wasted!	I don't find this funny at all.
Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?	Hey man, you're alright! How'd you like to be the new Chong?
How 'bout Don Johnson?	There is no Dave.
It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.	It'd be easier to meet Dave.
Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry...	And remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. Save lust and rage for me and the kids.
I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed!	Awww.
Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide?	It's not made of weed.
Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong.	Look, Homer, I really need you to be on your game, you know? A lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical.
Can we get high from the fumes?	Don't say that name! Now, you drive -- I have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a Magic Marker.
CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E...	Cut, print, mail to NBC.
"Oh yeah, I getcha -- ""work on the show."" Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference!"	That's funny, Homer. Now we really have to work on the show.
Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun.	Yeah, I got it. Listen, man, comedy is hard work.
CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED...	It is fun! The fun is the knowledge that our audience gets a good value for their hard-earned dollar!
BETTER SHUT UP / CHEECH IS REALLY MAD / I WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH CHO-ONG...	Stop that!
Oh yeah, a reward from Cheech!	You did all right, kid. You earned a reward.
Hmm?	Homer!
What the?!	Here's your reward!
Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?	Yeah! I'm taking you to a museum, man. Chong and I used to come here all the time.
Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures?	Now Homer, this Viramontes image is an example of how Chicano poster art preserves a culture ignored by Eurocentric society.
Can we at least get some French fries?	Ah, that's just the movies, man.
Stop speaking Spanish!	Too high in trans-fats.
It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk.	Now Homer, what did we agree about personal phone calls during rehearsal time?
Yes, sir.	That's right. Now let's take it from the part where we sniff each other's butts.
"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too."	I can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back.	But...
Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to.	Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back.
C'mon, if Art Garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp Paul Simon, you can do this.	Hey baby, you want a ride?
Tell him how you feel.	You mean you put nothing over nothing!
Come on, surrender to the moment! Don't make the mistake I always do of thinking too much before you act!	Yeah. Me too!
Hold on, lemme get the door here.	Dave's not here.
Who are you?	Hold on, lemme get the door here.
Oh, okay, wait, let's start again.	You ruined it, man -- you weren't supposed to open the door.
I'll be out here with you, Dave.	Close the door.
Yes?	Hey, Homer?
Okay. I'll go get some stuff.	Why don't you go and get us some stuff?
Way down here?	All right. Way down there. Way, way, way far down there.
Okay!	Yeah, keep goin'! Keep goin'! Now turn the corner! Turn the corner!
All right!	Yeah, keep goin'!
Gee, sorry, Dave.	It's me -- relieved!
Hey! Mr. Burns needs our help!	Help! Curtail my ascent! Curtail it, I say!
But I haven't finished my rituals yet!	Just shoot already!
All your money and all your stuff.	Simpson, your sharpened-shooting has saved my life! Name your reward. Anything -- just name it!
Uh, Super Bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?	Lower and likelier.
Well, this has been great. We should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting.	We'll stay for one inning, then we can go.
Oh, that's right! I hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city.	You're out of tonic.
EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! DO, DO, DO, DO / DO, DO, DO, DO...	"Ooh, the ""Fan Cam!"""
Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!	Eh. This song's a little bossy for me.
Tickle tickle too!	Stop it!
Tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!	Cut it out!
Marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. Has the Joker taught you nothing?	Homie, maybe you should stop. We've talked about the gray zone...
Son, I'm really, really sorry.	Dad, how could you do that? The whole audience saw me pee my pants!
Oh, I don't know if I can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. I-- whoo!... but I sincerely whoo!	Son, I'm really, really sorry.
No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!	Homer! Just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!
Whoo!	No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!
Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.	Unfortunately, the stain was picked up by Russian spy satellites, and President Dmitry Medvedev has taken the pants-wetting as a sign of American weakness. A Russian flotilla has just entered New York harb--
Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!	And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.
Now I have to work overtime--	I told you you should've stopped the tickling.
--just to counteract the self-confidence--	What?
Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that.	You can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.	That's great. Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!	There's one right here!
I miss my friends from drunk driving school. They were so cool.	You'll be fine, you always are.
Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart...	Uh, Homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years. What has that taught you?
"Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said ""Bart""..."	Wait. Hold on a moment. You were strangling your son?
I guess it's just how I was raised.	You're actually serious! You physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?
So... are those butter cookies for everybody, or...	I guess it's just how I was raised.
Who do you have next period?	Um... why don't we stop there for today... and I'll see you next week.
Hey, Doc. Where is everybody?	Who do you have next period?
Why didn't you tell me not to come?	I told them not to come.
Wha-wha-what are you doing?	But today he's here to assist me with you.
No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!	Homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small, and terrified.
Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again.	Fool-hearty... tattooed...
Um, I uh, lied about having health insurance.	I believe we've made excellent progress here today. And after another few years of twice-weekly sessions we can really...
Hello, boy.	And you're cured.
I want you to know I'm cured.	Homer.
Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man.	Good for you. No more drinkin'?
Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.	Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man.
Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.	Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops.	I just got up, man.
Why you little...?!	Fine.
I'll teach you to...	Why you little...?!
Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.	Say cheeese!
What the?!	Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.
Boy, get down from there!	What the?!
All right.	Okay, first I'll send down my shoes.
Why you little...	All right.
Oh c'mon, now you're a tree?	Why you little...
How many more, sir?	Oh yeah? Look.
These are my keys.	Fill the board then wash my car.
I-I said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir.	What was that?
No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!	I-I said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir.
"It's ""A-B-C-1-2-3""! It's the easiest song in the world!"	No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!
What?!	Homer! Homer!
Oh, that's ridiculous. How could two people from the same family need therapy?	The school called and said Bart is out of control. I think we may need some therapy for him.
Then what do we win?	Now Bart, I want you to guide your father safely through these cacti.
I dunno. There's something about this noose I just don't like.	Oh, I always forget about this part.
I don't know...	Homer, desperate times call for desperate measures. If you hop down from that limb, I assure you Bart will cut you down.
Y'see? You see how that boy pushes your buttons?	This is a tough neck! Oh, it's so strong! Like an old...
Son, you and I are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist.	Thanks, Dad.
Pretty sweet, eh boy?	Sue me for what? My home in a hollowed-out tree?
Not bad, not bad. Marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?	NOW THE YEAR'S FIFTH PEACH IS A FUZZY PEACH / ITS KISSES ARE QUITE TICKLISH...
What the? First we work, then I pay, then I have to eat fruit? Why was I ever born?	Actually, we pay them for each peach we take home.
Honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage.	C'mon, people. Peaches!
Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything.	Oh screw it.
My ear makes money?	And George Washington took a trip down the...ear-y Canal!
Hello, boat store? I'd like to order a boat. What do you mean, dial tone?	My ear makes money?
Let's see what else you've been hiding in there.	Kid scissors. Lame.
I want my pot of gold!	Let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
I forgot why I'm doing this.	Aye ca-rum-ba.
I can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. I'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!	Lisa, don't feel bad. Judas betrayed Jesus but he still got paid.
Hey, let me down! This is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!	I can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. I'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!
Okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. So why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down.	A peanut-butter-and-pretzel sandwich? There's no way a stupid Flanders like me could ever have thought of this.
I'll save you, Lisa!	I can't! I never learned how!
The real magic is raising three kids in this economy! You can put the ball back now.	I'll save you, Lisa!
"And, here you go. ""Do not give your coat to--"" Dammit!"	I'm through with magic, son. I'm gonna move back to Canada and run for Parliament.
I was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired.	Shush yourself.
Hmm...	Hey Dad, there's an arcade across the street... and there's really no point in all of us waiting in line...
Boy that's good.	I was invited to that party!
Woo hoo! First in line! Brought you a gift bag.	Next!
And we've got front row seats!	Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer.
Fat Tony! I was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.	I hope I'm not interrupting.
Oh my God!	I'm sorry, Fat Tony. My husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:
You are cruel but fair.	All will be forgiven... If, you sketch a portrait of Patty showing her inner beauty.
Dammit!	I'm trying. I swear I'm trying.
Yes! I'm so happy I lived to see this day! He did give her the kiss of death, right?	Vi dichiaro marito e presunta moglie. You may now kiss one another.
I decorated her car for nothing.	No!
Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.	He's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result.
Fat Tony! Are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at Christmas? And then an old Italian nun finds it. And she's all... No, no, no, oh, no, no! He's too beautiful to die! Ohhhh!	I still can't believe it. I have never been so snubbed at one of Selma's weddings.
Hm. So, should I bring a towel?	Homer, to restore the sisterical bond, you and Marge are invited to spend the weekend with us at our house down the shore.
Um, I take a special size.	We have towels.
Come on, Bart. We've been out here for hours.	Um, I take a special size.
Maybe we've found all the truffles. The only thing I've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.	Come on, Bart. We've been out here for hours.
I'll dispose of those for you.	Maybe we've found all the truffles. The only thing I've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.
Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach.	I don't think this is a good idea at all. The only husband of Selma's I liked was Disco Stu. He was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
Selma? Va-va-va-wha?!	These people are always grinding against each other, and I think they're all related. I wish we'd never come.
Well, if you insist.	Boo-frickin'-ya! Losers chug!
HEY!	TELL ME, WHEN WILL YOU BE MINE / TELL ME, QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO / HEY!
Wouldn't they be girls?	The boys needed to breathe.
You know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.	Oh, my poor Homie.
He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?	"Goomar?! That's mob talk for ""mistress."" Fat Tony has a mistress!"
I'll just sit here quietly.	He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
Sorry.	I'll just sit here quietly.
How could Tony cheat on me so soon?	Sorry.
Y'know Selma, from what I've seen here, Fat Tony has a lot of bad influences on him. I walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money.	How could Tony cheat on me so soon?
Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled.	Well, Homer and I are going to take you away right now.
"I don't wanna be ""that guy,"" but Marge is making me be ""that guy."""	"Whoa! You don't wanna be ""that guy."""
That's a wife ring? Marge, don't look!	That's a goomar ring. This is a wife ring.
Which is lucky for me because you're always right.	In a good marriage, you never say I told you so.
I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible.	Bart, I'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser.
Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too.	I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible.
Fine, whatever.	Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.	Fine, whatever.
And now, to break the news as gently as I know how.	I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.
Wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!	And now, to break the news as gently as I know how.
Who undid my do?	What happened to you?
That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.	Actually, it's kind of cute. You look like Posh Spice.
You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!	That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.
And stay out!	You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans.	I hear this is the home of Springfield's hottest hairdresser. I need a haircut -- and I need it in three, two, one, now!
A hundred dollars?! Marge, how much is that in smackaroos?	Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans.
Woo hoo!	One hundred.
Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so.	Are you sure you don't have a salon?
"Just call me ""Homer Fingerhands."""	Too bad.
Marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. It's like a beloved dog that died on your head.	I'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. But I never knew you were so good with hair.
Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon.	You better be!
Yeah. But what if I can't find any commercial rental property?	Well... Newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors.
Oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?	All day long, Apu goes on about Lady Gaga, who is doing nothing that Rava Khatan was not doing twenty years ago, while she was a member of Parliament!
I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk.	Because I have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. Turns out it was a substitute.
Not a good time.	I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk.
Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa.	I know Kirk resents that the dog likes me more, but Rex is just establishing dominance over the weaker male. That's what miniature dachshunds do.
Is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?	Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa.
Oh?!	Hey, I don't want a conversation.
All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face.	These are really good scissors.
Sorry Sarah, I'm retired.	Homer, can you make me look fan-cy?
I'd like to see you try.	But tonight's the Policemen's Ball! And if you let my Sarah down I can make life very difficult for you.
Excuse me.	Huh, where you goin'?
Come on! Would you--	Uh-uh-uh!
C'mon, bro, don't hassle me!	I, uh, I can also make very annoying noises.
Right.	What? No! Just cut her hair!
I can't. They won't let me. Lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands.	Homer? I thought you were gonna quit.
Suck! Of course!	Why don't you do here what you do at the nuclear plant -- namely, suck.
Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!	So, I told Timothy, you cannot keep basing sermons on old Seinfelds...
There's only one way out -- I'm committing Barbicide!	Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!
Why doesn't anything kill me?	There's only one way out -- I'm committing Barbicide!
I'm afraid it's all too true. My wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!	Stop talkin' crazy talk.
Another hairdresser?	I'm afraid it's all too true. My wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
"Aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life Warren Beatty lived in ""Shampoo."" And now it's time to pay you back..."	It worked perfectly. As if anyone but you can make me feel this beautiful.
As long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.	Homie, you're making my toes curl. You sure know how to please a woman.
I love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?	As long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
Awww...	Returned because of a fight over the pre-nup.
Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!	She wanted a cake with blue rosettes, he slept with her sister.
Time for a shortcut.	Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!
Woo hoo!	Time for a shortcut.
Fine.	Dad, our lives!
Uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way.	Fine.
Morning.	Uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way.
Uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car.	What's wrong?
Maggie!	That's the key to my box with the real skull.
Well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. This is from a gas station men's room. They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. These are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--	So how come we have all these other keys?
Stop who, Marge? Be specific.	Homer, stop him!
Well, it might have been the time when...	Keys to the Duff Brewery?! Where'd you get those?!
No.	Duffman doesn't need Duff to have fun! Seriously, you got any beer?
Or maybe I just found them on the ground.	I heard drowning makes you feel like you're drunk.
Oh my God... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...	Wow! The guys at the AA meeting will never believe this!
The Duff blimp! Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing.	Oh my God... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...
Really, Duff blimp? You really want me to?	The Duff blimp! Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing.
Oh, what the hell? Life is made to be lived. I've been buttoned down too long!	Really, Duff blimp? You really want me to?
When we see each other again you'll be an old man and I'll be a baby!	Hey Homer, I really had you going there, huh? Homer?
Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.	Okay, let's go.
Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking...	Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.
What was that?	Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking...
So long, suckers!	Before somebody gets hurt!
Hey, kids!	But it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? Don't drink it!	Hey, kids!
But there's so many buttons!	Dad, stop!
Blimp Assassin Three.	What videogame is this like?
Xbox.	For Wii or Xbox?
Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!	Original or Three-Sixty?
I'll save you, honey!	Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!
Boy! Stomp on my head!	I'll save you, honey!
You're a real jerrrk!	Yes! And I've got gum on my shoe!
Why you undead little...!	You're a real jerrrk!
That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero.	That's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.	Oh, I'm sorry, Homie.
Little help...	Whee!
But you learned! You grew!	In all my years of teaching, I've never raised a hand to a student.
I thought I was.	Uh Seymour, who's running this meeting?
Awww...	You've been in there for three hours! What are you doing, taking a bath?
Little help... little help... Flanders, little help?	Oh come on, Ned, we've both been married before. Those two boys of yours weren't delivered by stork.
Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry.	Homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?
Little help...	Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry.
Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy will put Jack back in the box.	Little help...
Okay, time to go back in the... night-night... This is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... I thought we had a deal, man!	Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy will put Jack back in the box.
Well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. That's a burn on you, Flanders.	Okay, time to go back in the... night-night... This is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... I thought we had a deal, man!
Whoa! Flanders, this chick does not get our thing!	It's not funny at all. Homer, I'd appreciate it if you weren't so rude to Ned.
Yeah, language.	Language.
Hey Ned, can I borrow some hair?	Don't do that, Homie. It rubs off your side hair.
Don't panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Here's what we do: I'll take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother.	See, Dad? Having Krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. Teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. We're natural enemies, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
Just the opposite of real life.	If fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible.
Yeah, isn't this place great? If you're single you can come here every night.	Just the opposite of real life.
Ned, let's cut to the chase.	Oh my.
Ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' Edna, then I don't wanna be brainheaded.	Yeah, let me guess. You're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' Edna.
Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude.	Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.
Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss.	That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time.
Ned, I have a confession to make: I may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you and Edna the best.	Can I get this by Tuesday?
Fellow barflies! To Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel!	Ned, I have a confession to make: I may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you and Edna the best.
Shut up.	We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room.
Guys, quit telling the truth!	My email address is Edna-lover-one-seventy-two. It was the lowest number I could get!
"Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says ""Walk This Way"" was inspired by ""Young Frankenstein?"""	Wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
"Don't you mean ""neighboreeno?"""	Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor.
You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!	No. Just plain neighbor.
I've got some bad news for you, Marge. I'm actually not.	I hope you're proud of yourself, Homer.
"Wha? My doctor said ""don't walk."""	Well, there's Ned out on his power walk. Maybe you should talk to him.
Flanders, hold up!	He's a good man and a good neighbor and you're drinking coffee from his mug right now.
I know, I know you're not comfortable with all the guys Edna's seen around town.	Flanders, hold up!
Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!	And country!
"And didn't the Easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" And if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work."	Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!
There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name.	We'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. Probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
Right. Teasing.	Homer! Stop teasing!
I'm waitin' for ya.	Right. Teasing.
Also, if you wanna find the real shooter of Mr. Burns, go back and look for more clues. They're all there!	I'm waitin' for ya.
Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy.	Homie, it was Maggie.
QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON...	Good evening. Tonight we reveal to you the fate of Nedna. I have devoted my summer to a more meaningful task: savaging Mr. Popper's Penguins online. Anyway, the answer to Ned and Edna is carefully hidden in tonight's episode like a breadcrumb lodged inside my stomach crease. Enjoy.

While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out...	LAST MAY!
Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime.	While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out...
Larry, my man!	Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime.
Hey, you're not Larry. How come you're not Larry?	Larry, my man!
Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that...	I wouldn't know, sir.
The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.	Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that...
Wha?!	Not interested.
Sheez!	Wha?!
Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?	"Hey, what's with that new security guard? He's acting all aloof. By the way, that's my word of the day: ""he's."""
Good ol' Larry.	Violent ward.
Say... Wayne, I couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. You want to go grab a beer after work?	Good ol' Larry.
Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping.	I prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers. It, um... hasn't worked out for me in the past.
As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped.	Hey, Wayne.
No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay.	Did you have a hard day too?
I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please.	"It's big to you. Would you like a ""get well"" pork chop?"
Charlie, wanna grab a beer?	I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please.
Oh. Okay.	No, I was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called, so I told them to call back tonight for more accurate answers.
Wayne!	Oh. Okay.
Want a ride?	Wayne!
You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name.	All right, Homer. You win.
Look, I'm not weird or anything, I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody.	Every town I go to I run into some guy just like this.
But what if the weathergirl--	"...and I don't want you calling me at home and saying ""turn on channel six""..."
Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's...	Excuse me, I need to use the...
Wayne?	Thanks for the upgrade. Ha-ha!
Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome.	That's comin' out of your stealings!
Oh c'mon, stay for dessert!	Sorry. I have to go.
Sure. Why not.	Hey Simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?
It's best to concentrate on what you do have.	Sure. Why not.
Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns.	Mother, is that you?
Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?	Dammit.
Of course. I mean, how long could it be?	Really? Are you sure?
That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future.	I have recurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past.
That robot took our jobs!	Un-fair! Un-fair!

Man, this robot really gets me.	Or maybe it was him.
Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's.	My nightmares are real.
Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating.	I needed somewhere to lie low, and your town appears on no maps or charts.

He has no friends.	Are you friend of his?
Except me!	He has no friends.
Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured...	I see you are tight like borscht and beets. Tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of Wayne's, would he attempt to rescue that friend?
Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?!	Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured...
No, not the middle seat!	Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?!
Death to America!	This just in: a local man has been kidnapped by Ukrainian gangsters. We've received the following video.

Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete.	Perhaps we'll be living in a world where there'll be no need to kidnap.
Oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. Think, geniuses.	Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete.
Hey, hey! What are you doing?	Shut up!
This is no way to treat the talent!	Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Cold. So cold.	I won a silver medal in Nagano!
So cold. Warm me up.	So, Wayne, once again you crash my party.
Just let me put my hands under your armpits.	Stop it!
Cold. So cold.	So much violence on the surface world. I'm going back.
Aww, that's what I call closure!	You ever eat on a train, Marge? What they call a steak is barely a hamburger. Now Homer, there's one more thing before I go.
They always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.	Shush me again and I'll take your head clean off.
I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.	Buy a Springfield Elementary t-shirt?
Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!	You don't have to yell!
Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!	Do I hear fifty dollars?
Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do.	Mr. Simpson, I know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt.
Here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... Ooh, I need more cash. Better go to my invisible ATM.	Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do.
What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!	So!
Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. Are you boys cyberbullying each other?	Hear hear! Hear hear!
Marge, I parented!	How could we be? We're all in the same place and we don't have computers.
Later, losers.	That's great, Homie! Come have some ice cream on a brownie!
Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.	I'm thinking of something big. So big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till Chalmers gets his job back!
Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!	Well, Dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe I should tell you...
You guys need to get a woman.	Come in and get some more!
Are you covering me up?!	He had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
The least I can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. It's kind of my way of sending a Christmas card. Happy Holidays, everyone! Family's fine!	Yes, I'm afraid we are.
I'm fine.	Dude, you'd better see this.
Okay... I'm on the floor... I can't move... so far a normal Sunday morning.	He opened his eyes! Mommm!
How did this happen? Last thing I remember, I was decorating the house for Halloween.	This is so horrible -- I can't speak...
Ah, Halloween. The one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage.	How did this happen? Last thing I remember, I was decorating the house for Halloween.
Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries.	Where's that spider?
It's alive?!	Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries.
Ow!	It's alive?!
Ow!	Ow!
Well, at least I still look good.	Ow!
Oh, Marge. This is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!	Just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
Oh my God! She's still on the first sentence! Must make her stop... how to express my...	"Dad, I'm going to entertain you with the help of ""The Brothers Karamazov."" ""Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place."""
I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!	Shhh. Don't say a word.
...I want you to find out what's making that funny noise in Homer Simpson's car. It's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. But you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. And you never hear it when you take it to the shop.	Do not question me, the star of the Bible! Now, on a non-murder-related note...
You forgot Patty and Selma. Oh, wait. That hasn't happened yet.	Homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob...
Now, how would that work?	Patty and Selma?! Who's next, Ned Flanders?
Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it.	Well, are we in Nebraska?
Come on! God does crazy things! Check your Old Testament.	Really?
Hey Bart... I mean, Jesus. Hey son, you want Flanders to kill anybody? He's totally in my power.	Hey, Dad.
And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!	Well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so I can't see the board.
Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?	You made a killer out of me!
Language.	Because of you I'm going to Hell!
Why you little!... /	Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?
"""In the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--"	I'm in.
Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately.	Roz Davis, your new assistant.
But I guess I should find out a little bit about you.	Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately.
So your dad has money to lend?	"I'm just a gal from Ohio who never wants to call her daddy again and say ""I need to borrow money."""
This is where we get our coffee. Just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. The burning smell will let them know.	So your dad has money to lend?
Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!	Genius.
Hello, Young man Burns.	Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!
That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.	Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy.
Oh well!	Well, when it's a handsome guy like you talkin'...
Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please.	What made you think of that?
Awww...	Hmmm... Must make sure these wires aren't crossed.
Marge, get my seal club! The big one!	Awww...
Hm.	And best of all I got funding for my Homer Humiliator.
Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me?	Hm.
Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort.	Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me?
Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me?	Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort.
Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!	Go ahead.
I thought of it first.	Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!
Marge, I just saw the greatest movie. Guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! I'll give you a clue, it's funny!	I thought of it first.
Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?	Simpson! A gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the Biograph.
Up or down?	You're demoted.
I'm telling you guys, Roz told Old Man Burns I ditched work early and now I'm her assistant.	Well then, critters it is.
What the-- This is a gentleman's club!	Enjoy. And as for you, Homer, don't worry. You're at Moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three.
This is terrible. What am I gonna do?	That comes in kid sizes too.
Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here.	Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie?
Do you know what I just learned? My job is the reason I get those checks every week! And now that I'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! Not in physical size, but--	Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here.
Am I early?	That's True. / Wow.
"Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this..."""	You're late.
You're mean!	Late.
Can one of the hundred be making the list?	Now, I want a list of a hundred ways to make your job worse by close of business today.
Can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?	No.
Do this, do that. Lousy Roz, thinks she's so big...	Why won't he love me?!
Hey.	"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason.	Homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?
Is this her?	Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been.
C'mon. The apple must be wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!	Is this her?
"Are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"""	It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth.
That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior!	And I haven't. Not until now.
Hail Flanders! Mightier than Jesus!	Oh that's nice, but I don't approve of--
Congratulations, Roz.	What the deuce? Sarcastic clapping?
Uh, I just came to say that you're perfect. So perfect, I think Mr. Burns should give you a hug.	What are you doing here, Simpson? If there isn't dry-cleaning in the back of my car, there's gonna be blood on my knuckles.
I won't say, but his initials are S.F.	Who told you?
Hug! Hug! Hug!	Stupid Flanders.
I don't know what that middle word means.	I underestimated you.
What is perception?	Well, it means my perception of you is that you were kind of a goof, but now I see you're rather clever.
No.	It's how I view you. You understand that?
Little help?	I used to think you were an idiot. Now it turns out you're not such an idiot, in fact, you might even be smart.
Need more butter! And not the unsalted.	Rub the butter around you.
And check these out...	Video game convention!
Is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?	VIP passes!
I won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.	Games don't have lives or points anymore, Dad.
Man, how many quarters does this game take?	This is the funnest game ever!
And we're in Hall D. Three halls, three minutes...	Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in Hall G!
No problem.	And we're in Hall D. Three halls, three minutes...
Out of my way! / Move it! / Geeks must yield to normals!	She means the most authentic.
Woo-hoo!	Room's full.
I need a nap!	Fun Dad rocks!
Yeah I was on today. Scary on.	The kids sure had a good time with you.
Look, honey, a family's like a team. And on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee.	"How come they never call me ""Fun Mom?"""
Okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a Saturday Surprise Dad Day.	It's not fair. Moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff.
That's good, Marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system.	What if... We roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!	Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha!
Oh no, I don't eat anything new unless I've eaten it before!	Relax, Homie. Have some leftover Galalalalalalalalah.
"I don't want to think about food, I want to like it. Why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different Krustyburgers we can see from our house?"	Aw, come on, Dad, be a foodie! You're already a fatty and a drunkie!
"Oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: ""la fridge!"" It's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!"	"I don't want to think about food, I want to like it. Why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different Krustyburgers we can see from our house?"
All right, food nerds, reality check...	I feel bad for all those places that didn't make the cut.
All the food in those pictures is poop by now. Minds blown, you're welcome.	All right, food nerds, reality check...
I'll remind you kids what real fun is!	All the food in those pictures is poop by now. Minds blown, you're welcome.
And I've got tickets for the grand opening Saturday night!	It only passed the safety panel by a three to two vote! And that third vote didn't come cheap!
"Fine. Blow off ""Fun Dad,"" go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs."	Sorry, Dad -- this is our thing now.
Jealous? Me?! That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!	Don't be so jealous, Homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me.
Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!	Of what?
Too sad to walk! Too sad and fun to walk...	Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!
When I'm sad, I make baseball bats.	What are you doing?
Really? You'd let me in on your thing? Even though I think it's stupid?	Homie, I don't want you to feel excluded. Would you like to come with us to dinner at El Chemistri?
Hand me that saw, Marge!	Of course.
When I'm happy, I make birdhouses!	Why?
Kids! Guess what? Mom invited me to your fancy dinner!	When I'm happy, I make birdhouses!
I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now!	Kids! Guess what? Mom invited me to your fancy dinner!
Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!	I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now!
Fun Dad is a foodie now!	Ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!
This is my thing and always will be!	Fun Dad is a foodie now!
You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it.	D'Artagnan wasn't a musketeer! He only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat.	Oh, I doubt it. You sit at communal tables, full of hipsters.
So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun.	And the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. It's too crazy for you.
East Oak Street, is that it?	1501 W-- East Oak Street.
Is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?	What do you want?
The experience begins!	Quiet, man!
Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. The open kitchen is a nice touch.	Before you is a deconstructed Caesar salad: romaine lettuce gel, egg yolk ice, crouton foam and anchovy air. You eat it like this: gel-ice-foam-air-foam-ice-gel-foam-air.
I guess I'll get started before my family gets here. How much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?	Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. The open kitchen is a nice touch.
Ouch, this place is fancy.	Fifty bucks.
Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong.	You don't look like the kind of guy who does this.
I'm doing this for my family!	Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong.
This better be dinner theater!	Pick up the meth! Pick up the meth!
Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!	Who am I kidding? I'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. I'm calling Homer.
Sorry!	And in you go!
Now that's my kind of foam.	Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!
Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist.	This is nice -- a family fun day!
Family fun day.	Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist.
Ex-tinct!	... the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years -- until a massive asteroid collided with the earth, bringing their reign to an end.
We're not here for you, we're here for Lenny.	Ex-tinct!
Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?	How is that the lesson? The point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place.
All right, you can each have one toy.	Gift shop!
All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!	He gets four and I only get two?! No fair!
I've waited my whole life to hear that!	Wait! Wait! Come back! Dad! Follow that dinosaur!
So tired... go on without me.	Stegosaurus backplates, used for either defense or control of body temperature, comin' through!
It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!	Everything I believed about young adult literature is a lie!
I demand to speak to my paleontologist!	Sir, you're inside an Allosaurus.
A million bucks?	Can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
I know five idiots!	"Every book on the ""Young Adult"" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!"
The perfect crime, eh?	And they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! It's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.	Whatever the job is, I'm not interested.
We're taking down kids who read.	I like the beat -- play me the tune.
I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.	Chapter-book crowd? That's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?
Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.	Tween-lit gang-write?
You're the Zephyr.	A Zephyr?
It won't be like Kansas City.	This better not turn out like Kansas City.
Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?	I'm in.
The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.	Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?
Do you have a computer?	All we need now is a computer guy...
You're in.	Uh, yes.
Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville.	I keep going over the job from every angle, but I can't shake the feeling that we're missing something.
Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?	I'll show you! I'll write a book myself! A personal story my readers will connect with!
Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!	And the protagonist always discovers that he is supernatural!
The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?	"Perhaps someone of my experience would be a valuable addition to your ""crew."""
But why?	Cheeseburgers, French fries -- I'm all over that, pal!
I just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is.	"It's good. ""Weekly Reader Star Selection"" good."
The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.	Who wants to see my cover mock-up?!
Yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript.	Hope you don't mind us printing our book in your room, Lis.
Woo-hoo!	Correction: finished manuscript.
We know, we wrote it.	This is a really good book.
Stupid, stupid, stupid! We forgot to create a fake author!	Where's your Franklin W. Dixon, where's your T.R. Francis, where's your Stephen King...
Or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.	A dog wrote a bestseller?! Aargh! All I've done is procrastinate! Who am I kidding? There will never be a book with my name on it.
No.	Do I have to do any writing?
"Gentlemen! To ""The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy!"""	Congratulations -- you just sold your book for a million dollars!
How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!	The trolls are now vampires, the Brooklyn Bridge is now a castle, and Fuzzlepitch is now Bloodball! Oh! Weak! Weak! And lame!
"But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""	But teenagers weren't going to spend their allowances to join Team Schmul.
Oh, that is so untroll-y!	No.
British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.	"What you're feeling is called ""pride of authorship."" You thought you only cared about money, but you actually care more about what you've created together."
Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.	Let's steal back our book.
Kansas City.	Kansas City.
Woo-hoo! All right!	So, you thought you would un-ruin your book. If it's any consolation, you never had a chance.
Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something.	Oh, by the way, the audio book is only available... abridged! Abridged!!!
Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you.	No need to thank me, boys.
You switched the drives?	I secretly switched the flash drives.
This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.	Off the dilge!
Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke.	Your cotillion seems to be in full promenade.
C'mon, just pick a popular song.	Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke.
Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog.	I have sixteen million songs, but, uh, no.
GOING UP SHE GOES! UP SHE GOES!	COME JOSEPHINE IN MY FLYING MACHINE!
"...So he says, ""Bigamy is having one too many wives."" To which I replied, ""So's monogamy."""	Indeed. That Homer Simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party.
It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet...	Simpson, you're probably wondering why you're here.
"The last thing I understood in that was ""pants."""	When I made you a hoop you split your pants! Now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. I'd like you to take over that position.
Well, in that case...	Yes. Simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. It means a hefty expense account and a corner office.
Woo hoo! No more church!	Before you say yes, Simpson, I feel it's my duty to warn you... ...account men lose their soul.
So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!	Woo hoo! No more church!
You know, you're kind of a downer.	The higher they rise, the further they fall!
I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?	You know, you're kind of a downer.
Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?	Hey, you're a baby account man. Still on the bottle. So for my last good deed before I retire, I'm gonna help you persuade Mayor Quimby to sign off on a nuclear rate hike.
I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?	Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?
I am really enjoying this, but, um... Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?	I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?
Awww... bourbon go bye-bye.	I am really enjoying this, but, um... Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?
Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect.	There ain't enough bourbon in Kentucky for you, big guy.
Wow, I can't believe I'm eating steak with the Mayor. The next time I vote for you it's gonna be on purpose.	Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect.
I've outgrown you!	Hey Homer! / Look at you, man!
Ah, Mr. Mayor! More peanut nore?	I've outgrown you!
Wow, these seats are amazing.	Say what you will, man, he's pretty resourceful.
Bo-ring.	And if you don't like the score you can change it yourself.
God, what a great game! And you too can be on the winning team, Mr. Mayor. The Springfield Nuclear Team.	Bo-ring.
I can't believe that was work!	I have never heard an analogy involving sports! I love it!
Oh, well...	Yeah, but work is over now. Wanna drink with me till I fall asleep?
I really should look at this picture a little longer.	Oh, well...
Okay, let's go.	I really should look at this picture a little longer.
Can you be my dad?	This set of bar tools has been passed down from account man to account man since the dawn of history... 1956.
It's a rat race, but it looks like I won.	If your mom was a secretary there's a good chance I am.
Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you.	Dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story.
And kiss.	I'll read! I'll read!
Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today.	Does anybody want my opinion?
Close enough.	I guess.
My work is so meaningless.	Homie, what are you doing?
You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it.	You make electricity. It runs the hospital!
It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it.	That's because it would kill you.
My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy.	I'm your wife.
You don't understand me. Only she understands me.	I'm going to bed.
Another round, kid?	You don't understand me. Only she understands me.
Uh... I got here after you did.	Another round, kid?
Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking...	Your wife is here, Mr. S.
Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?	Homer, I want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation.
That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children.	The farthest thing from this office I know: rafting down Rattler River Canyon.
You're not a client. You're the client.	Don't talk to me like I'm a client!
I'll handle it. I always do.	Simpson! Put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! The mumpish oafs in Washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment.
Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?	Rafting, eh? It's a perfect way to entertain them. Finally, humanity has found a use for water.
Oh no you don't.	Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?
It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is.	Coggily-doggily.
Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me.	But Mr. S... you just promised this week to Mrs. S, Master B., and Mamselles L. and M.!
Oh Marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into.	Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me.
Not sure what you're going for, but	And maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
Uh... Marge, why don't I catch us some salmon?	Not sure what you're going for, but
Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in.	It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
So, everybody good?	Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in.
Uh-oh. If you've got that, then...	And yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss!
Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!	Are you sure you're Martin Scorsese?
This family time is so precious. Gotta go.	Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!
Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep...	Take us out first! Anyone can start a family! These days, no one can find a job!
My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...	Hurry! We're heading for the falls!
Whose side are you on?	For God's sakes, Homer! I've given you three children!
Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun.	Well, Simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven.
Hey kids, I'm it!	Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun.
I'm okay! And I found some gold!	Hey kids, I'm it!
Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant.	Oh, I'm so glad you're not an Accounts Man anymore.
It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?	We have to see the Museum of TV before next Wednesday when it closes forever.
Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.	Whoa! The gun Sheriff Baby wore! Hm.
My pants are splitting wide open!	Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.
And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!	Not so hard. She'll know we have a past.
Fatso Flanagan!	And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!
Only the funniest black-and-white man ever!	Who's Fatso Flanagan?
"Everything's a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners."" Margie, you're the greatest."	"Isn't that just a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners?"""
They were so childless and miserable.	Just you wait, Eunice! Just you wait. Ka-chik, Kaboom, Ka-Splatter! See yer grave there?
How would you know?	The size forty-eights. That's when he was the funniest.
Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?	"If you ever hear a star's name and wonder ""is he dead?"" The answer is either I represent him, or ""yes."""
Would I!	"Would you play a bloated corpse on ""CSI?"""
Now I hate him too.	Come on in, it's a long story.
What about mimes?	I was so mad at him, I didn't have sex with a clown for five months.
Good one, boy.	They're pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out.
Wow, I can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!	My legs!
Christmas card photos?!!	Which means, it's the start of Christmas season...which means...
"Are we done yet? ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about to start. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie..."	Not me, man. This cycle of jerks has to end.
Shut up!	I see you are reading a children's book. Yet your profile indicates you are a mature adult. Is there an error?
"Oh Marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?"	Shut up!
I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.	"Why do you say ""future?"" This is now."
Ooo, a b-mail!	I just got a message from Maggie in my brain.
"Hey, I got a b-mail too! ""You have won a valuable prize! Open now""..."	She's coming home for Christmas! And Bart's bringing the boys! And Lisa's coming with Zia! For once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!
Too late!	Don't open it, Homie! It's a virus!
Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles.	Too late!
I'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.	Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles.
No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke.	Hey Grampa. Are you gonna build a snowman?
Who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?	Thanks for spending so much time with us, Dad.
Hey, sweetie. Marge said there was some family tension. And at Christmas of all times.	Oh-oh, can I have the whole can?
"""Bloody Harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! Now, I'm gonna show these boys downtown Springfield."	Hey, sweetie. Marge said there was some family tension. And at Christmas of all times.
No, don't worry, I have my invisibility cloak. Now where did I put it?	"""Bloody Harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! Now, I'm gonna show these boys downtown Springfield."
This is where my father is.	But I especially look up to you.
He froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure.	This is where my father is.
Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home.	Are they working on one?
See you next Christmas!	Ah, I don't see what's great about 'em! And Homer, you're still a big disappointment. Because...
To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em.	Why did you bring us here, Homer?
Your Dad may be a little immature, but I know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance.	To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em.
Is it snowing down here?	You've taught us the meaning of Christmas, which schools are forbidden to tell us any more.
If those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe I can forgive...	No, one of the freezers is busted.
I love you, Dad.	Lawn chair-breakin'-- Hair-losin'-- Marge-lovin' barometer-dropping-- Father-freezin'-- But you'd always come and get me when I wandered out on the freeway -- 'cause deep down you couldn't bear to see me smooshed.
Finally. The only thing I wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.	Next!
I just don't understand the world of grownups.	Cousin Kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt.
Absolutely. Let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.	Sorry sir, your bag is two pounds over the limit. Are you sure everything inside is essential?
High school yearbooks...	Absolutely. Let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.
Don't argue in front of the airport line. Strangers are judging our marriage!	I told you not to pack them!
Marge, do we really need all these feminine products?	They self-reference each other.
Yes, but I never use that kind of toothpaste!	That's toothpaste!
Try to catch one on your tongue.	I need my books!
Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.	Sir, you've been selected for a pat-down.
Now, if I fart, that's 'cause I'm so relaxed.	Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.
Yes there is! Woo hoo.	Sir, there isn't enough room.
Huh? What the--	Welcome to flight 55 to Bozeman, Montana by way of Miami. Due to an unforeseen jailbreak in New South Wales, our takeoff is gonna be just a little bit delayed. So we're gonna be turning off the air, but ethnic people are permitted to open and eat their home-cooked food.
But I have to go to the bathroom!	Sir, return to your seat.
Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!	You should've thought of that before you drank the fluids you need to live!
Airlines don't treat people like people anymore!	Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!
You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!	Airlines don't treat people like people anymore!
Never putting me next to a pretty girl...	You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
Look, all I want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!	Come on, ladies. You're all deputies now.
You can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! And why is there moisture between the windows?! And don't wake me up to land! Just land!	Look, all I want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!
You can't check my spirit!	Perfect.
And why is there moisture in between the windows?!	You can't check my spirit!
And don't wake me up to land!	And why is there moisture in between the windows?!
Because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, I can't go out in public.	Why are you in disguise?
They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!	When I heard Homer speak I no longer felt small.
Give me another one!	They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!
Almost a winner!	Give me another one!
Woo hoo! I'm famous again!	I'm Nash Castor! Coming up, we butt heads with Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan and Mitt the Wonder Romney! But first, we're here with this guy my kid said was a thing: Homer Simpson.
Well, if I could explain myself...	That's a great point, Adriatica.
Yes. Yes! Got it!	Homie, you can win this argument! Just rant and rave like you do to the TV during sports!
Not so fast!	And we're back with Homer Simpson, who's about to become a soggy Pamper flung to the side of history's freeway in three.. two...
But I do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. I bet Chuck the cameraman and Steve the sound guy know where I'm coming from.	Now, I may not be some mani-pedied TV blowhard...
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!	Everything's closed!
Aw, son. Now I regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked.	From now on when someone asks me, I'm gonna say you are my father.
Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.	Homer, you're getting your own show.
"Welcome to ""Gut Check With Homer Simpson""! Where the truth is served, with a side of in your face!"	Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.

A high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!	Zoomy, zoomy, zoomy Dateline, Nebraska.
Goodnight and good gravy.	A high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!
Oh yeah, that's right. It's already happening, people. Hoard your toilet paper! Shoot the mailman! Shoot the mailman!	"Are you ready for Irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""Oh, that's a lovely touch! Oh, such beautiful form!"" If we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, Rudys, Ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! Ochocincos..."
This is going so great. I'm already a Halloween mask.	No way. When a guy who loves America cries, it makes him super straight!
It's still a great honor!	That's not you. They just painted Shrek yellow.
Great question. I know you children have never seen your father cry before... Marge, do we have any more gravy?	Dad, I'm glad your show is successful, but I have to ask you: what's with the crying?
Why? Oh why?	No, we're out.
Oh Marge, don't worry. People know I'm doing a character, like Stephen Colbert, or Newt Gingrich.	Homie, I'm glad you're passionate, I just hope you're not riling people up with your show.
"Welcome back to ""Gut Check."" I have something very, very pro-American to share with you. Come with me."	Oh Marge, don't worry. People know I'm doing a character, like Stephen Colbert, or Newt Gingrich.
Death to America! I mean, over here.	"Welcome back to ""Gut Check."" I have something very, very pro-American to share with you. Come with me."
You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle.	Death to America! I mean, over here.
Take that, centers of art and commerce. And this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. That's right, I'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!	You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle.
"When March Madness spills into April -- that's the gravy! When someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy!

And this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. That's right, I'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!
So get on the boat... the gravy boat.	"When March Madness spills into April -- that's the gravy! When someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! When you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!"
Great show, people. Great show. Um... Not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? Not a big deal.	So get on the boat... the gravy boat.
Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.	So, what's this with the gravy boat?
Don't worry, sweetie. I think I know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy.	You know, symbols can often rile people up. The swastika... the New York Yankees logo...
Marge, I'm going to meet with the Republican establishment and pick their nominee! If there's sandwiches there, you want me to bring some back?	"The gravy boat movement is spreading across the nation like a rumor about some kid and someone's mom hooking up at a high school.

Then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?	Speaking for Lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore.
Only one hundred percent?	Um, none.
Now Lisa, I'm an entertainer. And you can't entertain and inform at the same time. And if you're Access Hollywood, you do neither!	Dad, you shouldn't do this. It's not fair how much influence you have!
I don't know. Can't we get Chris Christie to run?	Now they're all excellent choices, so simply pick the white male candidate you prefer and we'll elect him.
Eh, maybe I'll vote democrat. The great thing is when they get in they act like Republicans.	Save me, Obama Care!
Oh, yes.	Dad, you cannot endorse Ted Nugent. I mean, sure, we all love his music...
Huh? Who's there?	Arise, Homer Simpson!
Mozart!	Huh? Who's there?
Can we get some pizza on the way?	Now come, and I shall teach you of democracy!
They sell some at the gas station.	Can we get some pizza on the way?
So, how come your picture's not on money?	I don't want gas station pizza!
Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.	Actually, I'm on the five thousand dollar bill.
What's this? Some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?	I want to show you something.
Nerds! You want I should mess 'em up?	"These are the framers of the Constitution, Homer. This great nation is built upon the hard work of, well as you would say, ""nerds."""
But gravy is the freedom where--	You are an embarrassment to the aristocratic slaveholders who forged this mighty nation!

No, no, John Hancock! I don't need insurance! Sam Adams, I'm sorry I made fun of your winter ale!	Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect Taxes... no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other Staaaate...
It was all a dream! Oh Marge, Oscar Madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!	Homie, wake up.
Lisa, you were right! I'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!	It was all a dream! Oh Marge, Oscar Madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!
Yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?	Oh, Dad! I'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason.
"""Springfield Colonial Village""?!"	Yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?
What the?	"""Springfield Colonial Village""?!"
You faked it?! Lisa, how could you?!	What the?
That's what a play within a play is for!	I did it just to mess with your mind.
Well, if there's one thing I don't like being taught, it's a lesson. I'm so mad. Not only will I endorse Ted Nugent...but I will call for an end to the direct election of senators.	No strangling on school days!
Really? That made sense? Then I'm definitely doing it.	Dad, no!
Folks, because I love democracy so much, I command you to vote for this man whom I alone have selected as your next President:	Really? That made sense? Then I'm definitely doing it.
"Now to baptize his candidacy with my tears. The words ""strutting stadium rocker"" are overused these days, but when I first met Ted Nugent..."	Folks, because I love democracy so much, I command you to vote for this man whom I alone have selected as your next President:
What? My emotions were so powerful...	"Now to baptize his candidacy with my tears. The words ""strutting stadium rocker"" are overused these days, but when I first met Ted Nugent..."
It's not working... But why?	Come on, hurry up and cry so I can get elected and open up the San Diego Zoo for big game huntin'.
Oh my God, she's right. My lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. My ears are keeping their mouth shut.	Maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing.
My fellow Americans... I am full of crap.	Oh my God, she's right. My lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. My ears are keeping their mouth shut.
I GOT A GOOD SONG FEVER / A TED NUGENT FEVER / SOMETHING SOMETHING FEVER...	THERE IS A NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT IS SWEEPIN' THE LAND / AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY ME / AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD WHILE I WAS WASHING MY DOG / SUCK ON THAT FRANCIS SCOTT KEY...

U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--	U.S. OF A!
Down in front!	Well, McBain. You certainly picked a bad time to come out of retirement. I hope you have a... Cobra plan.
Dammit! Why do kids have heads?	Down in front!
But I'm invested in the characters.	Homie! Stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
I make my own turnoffs.	You'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
And that, kids, is how you stick it to the Towne Centre Real Estate Investment Trust. No, no, no. Woo hoo!	I make my own turnoffs.
No, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. Everyone act like we're buckling up to go home.	Someone thinks we're leaving. I'll wave them off.
Marge, if you were married to Da Vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to Da Vinch.	Homie...
Leaving? Why on earth would you think that?	Dammit, are you leaving or not?
And ours!	We totally wasted his time.
This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt.	And ours!
You try it, Maggie!	This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt.
Do-over!	I was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. Better sort those out.
Woo hoo!	Do-over!
Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.	Woo hoo!
Draw the curtain.	Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
Less blathering, more slathering.	Sir, as a complexion scientist, I must advise you against using any more. This is the most powerful hydrator we sell.
I don't trust this place. Where are the cashiers?	Enough!
I'll take it! Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.	I wish my dates were this interesting.
Sweet!	I already have.
"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."	Sweet!
Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?	I have no friends.
Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare.	Okay.

And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!	Wow, I've created something incredibly popular!
You never showed it to me.	And I created an alcoholic hippo!
I still wanna see it.	A stupid alcoholic hippo!
Then why did you say it?	There is no hippo!
Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?	'Cause you're the hippo!
Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer.	"And so this so-called ""SpringFace"" spread from the world of children to adults..."

"...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? Delete! Delete! Hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete."	I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind...
What the! That idiot cut me off!	Damn, I got ass-shrapped!
I'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his SpringFace profile picture to a shot of a monkey. Get that, Marge? A monkey!	What the! That idiot cut me off!
Right. Status update: Homer... is... watching... the...	Help us, Larry Summers!
Marco!	No. We want your Dad.
Come on, Lisa!	Marco!
Fish out of water!	Polo!
Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.	You were only supposed to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Needs flavor.	Uh... there once was a boy named Ali Baba. He and his elder brother Cassim were the sons of a merchant who traded in camels and spices and--
That's better.	Rag soup!
Oxygen... I need oxygen.	I was part of an expedition to the top of Mount Everest. One that had the distinction of failing un-heroically.
We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day.	Why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on Valentine's Day?
Thanks for reading it to me.	"""My darling husband. This Valentine's Day, I have a present for you..."""
Which one do you want?	It's okay, Homie. Go. Have a good time. Take Bart with you!
You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing.	Which one do you want?
That's right, sucker! It's Valentine's Day, and I've got a date with some fastballs!	You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing.
Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there.	Somehow I missed that phase.
I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.	Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there.
Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there.	Oh, my. I don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before.
Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys.	My mother said I should bring some wine.
So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?	Right. Right.
"Did you say ""ultimate Frisbee?"""	She wants to steal a kiss, like Pyramus and Thisbe.
Don't worry, ladies! I'm-a comin'!	Thanks. But I couldn't have done it, Mom. I mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life.
Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up.	All Springfielders should now move off the streets and inside their homes. Please avoid the superstitious panic which marked the recent lunar eclipse.
Then why am I paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?	I know it's futile, but I must again point out there is no dragon.
Lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. Jeez, pick up a book.	Again, I maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance.
Then you have a serious reading problem.	I pick up books like you pick up beers!
So do your farting now.	Now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
"Don't worry. My last words will be ""I can outrun that lion."""	Homie! What if that was the last thing you ever said?
Two can play at that game.	Not me.
I can do this... I can do this...	Two can play at that game.
Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!	I can do this... I can do this...
And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!	I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
It's fun, but not as fun.	And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!
Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?	What's going on? Why is there a picture of us? This isn't good.
Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy.	Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?
We won! Woo hoo!	The simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after Homer's drunken shenanigans...
"I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."	I withdraw my... diddily...
Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!	"I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought.	Simpsons, in accordance with article six, section two of the town charter...
I mean a thousand-year flood!	Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought.
I mean a thousand years of perfect weather.	I mean a thousand-year flood!
Soda, eh?	If you see a Simpson, do not try to reason with it. Just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda.
Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!	Dad, where are we going? Do we have a plan?
Fine.	Hey, Henrietta Hippo, I've got to drain the inchworm.
Please. Put that down.	Fine.
Not you! Him!	I just got started!
We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window.	"Rejected by society, huh? Well, why didn't you say so? Welcome to the off-the-grid, unincorporated settlement we proudly call ""The Outlands!"""
Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back.	THE OUT-LANDS!
Helmet? That's Springfield talk.	Should I get my helmet?
Springfield talk!	Is there gas in these?
Private plane crashes.	Well how are we supposed to get fuel?
Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives.	Ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! Y'know, I'm glad we're in exile.
Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear.	Don't be ridiculous. It's an Afghan wedding being bombed.
Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes.	He's no Ned Flanders. And I miss the Springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. God help me, I even miss Helen Lovejoy criticizing my brownies.
Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield.	Yes it does.
"Oh, ""Smithers""!"	Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield.
Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it!	Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone.
Excellent.	Mr. Burns! You might catch a cold out this late. You want my jacket? Here, lemme warm my gun up for ya.
You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you.	"Yeah, it wouldn't be you if you didn't say ""excellent."""
Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?	Look! A shooting star!
Strike! Woo hoo!	On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.
Ever since the day we met.	Wanna make out over the foul line?
The old homestead. Remember when we moved in and I talked like this?	Ever since the day we met.
Someone's downstairs!	Yeah, this place is awesome, but it's not puppy safe, and my little guy's coming tomorrow.
All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?	That is pretty smart.
We hate opera!	Cancel their subscription to the opera!
Nooo!	Then get them a subscription to the opera!
Yeah. Non-jerks!	Don't even bother shooting us. We've found a new place that we love. A place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more...
Well, I've tightened the bolt! I think we're good!	That's all it took? I just had to ask?
This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on!	You sure this is a good idea?
I was wrong, there are bad ideas! There are terrible ideas!	This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on!

That's not a choice you get to make.	No!
Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.	Hey! Guys! What can I getcha?
Well, I rented that plane.	I probably shouldn't have given this place five stars on Yelp.
True, true.	I, uh, heard everything was goin' great in your new Eden, with one flaw: you lack a corrupt city government.
Yes! Awake! Let's do this!	Dad? Dad?
You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present.	Dad, I wanted to give you a heads-up. Mom's birthday is tomorrow. It's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting.
"""Love""?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed."	Wha--? Mom is gonna love that!
By the box lady herself!	By who? Lenny?
Man, oh man, look at this place! Finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something.	Yeah.
Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.	These'll go great with betel nut butter!
Apu! What are you doing out of your natural habitat?	Oh really?
Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!	Now see here. I have always considered you cash-giving cows to be my friends. And friends do not betray friends!
Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.	Convenience forever, freshness never!
You would do that? Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!	How would you like it if I called your wife live from my show tomorrow to wish her a happy birthday?
Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever.	Now, last but not least, your present, Homie.
The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one...	Well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good.
I repeat. One...	The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one...
Onnnnnnneee...	I repeat. One...
...Onnneee... onnneee...	Onnnnnnneee...
Onnneee.	Please don't say one again.
This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!	Homie, whatever it is, it's not happening.
A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!	Well, at least you remembered I like her.
The phone's dead.	A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!
Normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! Hm, a chew-through. What could have...	The phone's dead.
Aw... I mean arrrgh!	Normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! Hm, a chew-through. What could have...
You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!	Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity.
Why you little... I'm gonna get... No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!	I think that's enough birthday fun.
No backtalk! In the cage! Now!	No way, man! I'm a free-range kid!
Get in there!	No backtalk! In the cage! Now!
Son, do you have a minute?	Get in there!
I've been thinking. I really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies.	Son, do you have a minute?
What?	Don't wanna come out.
Boy, get out of that cage!	I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!	But it's my home now, sir.
Stupid kid.	Fine.
This isn't comfortable at all! I don't see how a rabbit could possibly--	Stupid kid.
DRI-VING-TO-WORK!	If you wake up my pigeons they're gonna do their business again. And these days there's no newspapers so I have to put down Amazon Kindles. I'm like... it's, it's bankrupting me.
Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.	DRI-VING-TO-WORK!
Don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! Geez, it's all over the place. Holy Moly.	Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.
Heard about this thing, boy?	"Tag, we're it! Springfield has been hit hard by a mysterious graffiti artist and his iconic calling-card, which we have dubbed ""Mr. Fatso."""
Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?	No, no, I'm too concerned with unemployment.
Not now, Marge!	Homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?
Pretty dope, don't you think?	Boy, you like this necklace I just bought?
Hey Bart, check this out.	Yeah, sure, baby.
Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso! It's funny 'cause it's so preposterous.	Hey Bart, check this out.
What the--	I carumba? Not so loud! If my Dad hears about the show, he might realize Mr. Fatso is him!
What? No! It can't be!	What the--
Shut up! I'll fix you!	What? No! It can't be!
Yes, master.	Shut up! I'll fix you!
Here car. Here, boy.	Yes, master.
Why you little...	Oh, this is just a dream. All I have to do is wake up.
Well, we do.	C'mon, Dad. You made me mad so I got back at you. How was I to know parents had feelings?
You just ruined my car.	I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy.	Correction. It's worth ten times as much.
Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?	You're welcome. And from now on, Dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me.
Both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. He's just trying to fit in.	Wait, is the Hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?
Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car.	Well, we've gotta teach him a lesson somehow.
Did you guys see that stupid foul call in the game last night?	Item being procured: one standard-size paperclip.
Unguarded stuffff...!	Hey, the supply room's open. I better close it.
Mr. Burns! Save me, panic!	Can someone open this bottle of mother wolf placenta for me?
Woo hoo!	Mr. Burns! Save me, panic!
How ya doin' there?	Only one of you monkeys wasn't caught with his sticky paw in my tin cup... Homer Simpson!
"Well sir, before I do anything I stop and ask myself, ""What would Jesus and Mr. Burns do?"""	Now Simpson, how is it that you alone manage to keep your moral compass pointed to true north?
Y'know boy, my dad used to take me fishing just like this.	No you may not!
More angry texts from work!	Y'know boy, my dad used to take me fishing just like this.
"Hey, it's called ""karma."""	I can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!
A common misconception.	Isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?
Suck it, karma! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you, karma! Karma's a bitch, karma!	A common misconception.
Nothin' better than a lazy Saturday morning, lying in a warm, moist bed. Because weekends are-- Moist?!	Suck it, karma! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you, karma! Karma's a bitch, karma!
I wet the bed! The one embarrassing thing I've never done!	Nothin' better than a lazy Saturday morning, lying in a warm, moist bed. Because weekends are-- Moist?!
"Marge, from time to time I've heard you speak of a ""washing"" ""machine."" Where would I find this marvelous contraption?"	I wet the bed! The one embarrassing thing I've never done!
Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!	Why? Are you going to do the laundry?
Don't yell at me, brain! This happened on your watch! You have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!	Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!
I like to watch Lamar Odom play X-Box while his giant wife yells at him. Is that so nuts? Huh? Yeah, shut you up.	Don't yell at me, brain! This happened on your watch! You have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!
Now, I'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. But just to make sure...	I like to watch Lamar Odom play X-Box while his giant wife yells at him. Is that so nuts? Huh? Yeah, shut you up.
But isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?	Ho-mer! You do not yet understand the meaning of kar-ma!
Deep down, I must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! And my problem won't stop till I make things right with them. But first, a little more sleep.	That is beside the point, okay? If something bad is happening to you, it must be because of something you did to others.
I'm sorry. Cheese on that? Sorry. Hey, Lenny. Sorry.	Who the hell are you?
"One more announcement: make sure you whack ""piñata me"" and not real me."	I'm sorry. Cheese on that? Sorry. Hey, Lenny. Sorry.
So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?	A lot of work went into this thing.
Free? Uh...	Ain't no problem that free food and free booze won't fix!
Free it is!	Free? Uh...
What the?! Wet again?! I did the right thing for nothing! There's only one solution left.	Thanks, guys. Tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of Mars except for the poles.
Okay... Place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!	Homer Simpson! You forgot your receipt for your adult bedwetting product! Homer Simpson! Are you there?
Now that's what I call looking out for number one.	Okay... Place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!
Um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep.	What's going on?
You stupid...	Um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep.
Son, I'm afraid the Uralarm Whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke.	What's goin' on? Is this a joke?
Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed.	What is going on?
"Hey, when you were pregnant everything was ""we."""	We're wetting the bed?
What about Cupid? He's smokin' hot.	I'm sorry, Homie. A diaper just isn't sexy.
Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside.	He's a baby with wings!
BUM-BA-BUM-BA / BUM-BA-BUM-BA...	Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside.
Hey, guys! Whatcha doing in my dream?	What am I, a babysitter?!
What do I do?	Trying to fix your broken brain.
My brain's fine! In my dreams I'm an intermediate skier!	What do I do?
Great, now Death knows.	You wet the bed?!
Um nothing... typical dream nonsense.	What do you see?
I know this dream! It's the land of my innermost thoughts and fondest desires!	We never do my thing!
Uh, Marge, this is my friend Keggy...	Welcome back, handsome.
Woo hoo!	In this fantasy Kwik-E-Mart, you get your change in bacon.
Oh, lighten up, Marge. I take you to the Disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the Lost and Found. Well guess what? We're stayin' in this dream forever!	We know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
Whee! I'm in me! / Oh! / I love the down parts! Here comes!	Oh, lighten up, Marge. I take you to the Disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the Lost and Found. Well guess what? We're stayin' in this dream forever!
Quick! Gum up the gears with Moes!	All right, I'll do it myself. Give me that, give me it!
Thank you, Death. And may I ask what's taking so long with Larry King?	Oh Death, you're a lifesaver!
Mom?!	...death.
Just like my hair.	No, but I live on in Homer's dreams.
Exactly like Chandler, always criticizing.	"That's Jennifer Aniston's hair on ""Friends."""
Wow!	Something that just might help Homer wake up dry.
Roomy.	Wow!
Why you little...	Man, Homer, you've always been a loser.
There's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!	Why you little...
You left him because I tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!	You got home hours late with no fish. It was only a few weeks later that I left your father for good.
It's true! I failed the basic duty of childhood. And then when I took Bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!	Pathetic. A kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
I'm cured. I'll never wet the bed again.	And when the time came that I had to leave your father, I knew you were in good hands.
No can do, baby.	And maybe you'll stop overeating too!
Goodbye.	And now you'd better run along, sweetheart.
Woo-hoo! I'm dry! Come on, everybody! Feel daddy's underpants!	Goodbye.
So what do I do again?	We'll take your word for it.
All right.	Spin the top. If it falls over, we're in reality. If it spins forever, we're still in a dream.
Look at it go! All right! Hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town.	All right.
It's just dream hail! Ow! Oh! Ow! Dream hail! Hey, there's a dream truck!	Is that hail coming down?
Thank you.	Think he's okay?
Woo hoo! Thank God it's T.G.I.F!	Oh yeah, you don't wanna go to the hospital at five o'clock on a Friday.
You're outta here, drug-o.	Some casual Friday this is.
Well... I didn't really feel like going to Moe's today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.	Homie! You're home early!
Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.	Company physical coming up, huh?
So, what's on the agenda?	Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.
Why did I do that? / It sounds so dull and boring. / What was I thinking?	...you promised to help me write a haiku...
What the-- Section 1 of Article 21 of the State Constitution is amended to read: Section 1. In the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of Congress at the beginning of each decade, the Legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of Congressional, State Senate and Assembly districts. Liquor... mustn't think of liquor...	And you and I were going to study the municipal voter's guide.
So, a sober weekend hasn't been that hard. Let me just take a few antidepressants here.	Wait a minute. That feels good.
I feel sorry for people without willpower. I truly do.	So, a sober weekend hasn't been that hard. Let me just take a few antidepressants here.
A surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.	Homie, what are you drinking?
Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.	There's champagne in those!
Oh man, I'd better have some coffee and iced tea.	Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.
What about this lemonade?	No! Irish and Long Island!
Then I'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! Oooh, cake!	Mike's Hard!
Crepes!	Rum cake!
Cherries!	Suzette!
Jubilee!	Cherries!
Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord...	Wow, passed with flying colors! I've sure earned this!
Comicon nerds!	Ladies and gentlemen, meet the future masters of the human race.
A must!	Sir, I'm afraid we do need to keep one human worker to sign for packages, a scapegoat for meltdowns, things that would be a waste of the robots' time.
"Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."	So we need one meat sock on the payroll. But who?
Does the chair go back like this?	Simpson, wait! As it turns out, there is one job available. But be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom.
Woo hoo!	Yes.
So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers.	Nice parking, idiot.
So, workin' hard or hardly workin'?	So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers.

"Hey, I've gotta tell ya, I'm miserable there. I'm all alone	 and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?"	Homer, show a little more sensitivity around these jobless washouts, huh?

That's exactly what I'm having! You guys totally get me.	Sounds like you are having... family difficulties.

"""Stranded?"" What's that?"	Sued it.
Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima.	"""Stranded"" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. It was huge! Well, the first season and the last season."
A plane crash!	Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima.
Wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!	A plane crash!
What a great opening episode. And I'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!	Where are we??
You know, I should get back to the treadmill.	I'm just not ready for cookies!
"The lava being! That's why they showed a clip of it on ""previously on."""	I might be back!
Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved.	You're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? And when I wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!
"Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? What does it mean?"	Oh my God! It's just like Dad's!
And where will I watch TV?	It means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
And where will I walk?	On the TV!
And where...	On the ground!
We've had stupider!	This is the stupidest fight ever!
Homie!	At last! This episode promises to finally answer one question!
Ooh, that's great! Can it wait another hundred and four hours?	The kids are away and Maggie's napping...
She walked away and slammed the door. What does it mean? What does it mean?	Ooh, that's great! Can it wait another hundred and four hours?
Oh that's such a first-take answer!	It means I'm mad!
"Thank you all for coming to my ""Stranded"" discussion group!"	Ooh! Ooh! You have cloven me from my ponytail to my slipper shoe! Get out. And never return! Oh, unless you want to buy old Archie comics. Twenty-pound bricks are a dollar.

Spoiler!	So you don't know that Season Five was a complete wank.

I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die.	Homer, for God sakes, I'm trying to put Maggie to sleep!
Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now.	"You wanna know what happens on your stupid show? Firstly, the ""mysterious island"" is fifteen miles from Long Beach. Also, Doorway Three led to Hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to Hell, and the entire Strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!"
Lousy Marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his TV show... I'd tell my best friend, but that's Marge too...	Whoa, you should write that down, man.
Well...	"Care to join me in a private ""last episode party""?"
Okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.	It's okay, Dad. He's just putting the fear of God in me.
"Again with ""Mr. Steak!"" Do you know why I go to Mr. Steak? Because at Mr. Steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at Mr. Steak!"	"I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at ""Mr. Steak."""
Why don't you talk to Mrs. Steak?	Well of course they don't.
Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!	Face it, we're just kids. We can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. All we have in the world are the things our parents give us.
Bart's been raptured! And his crap's been craptured!	Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!
Nice doin' business with you, boy.	"I can't, I sold my ""dinner futures."""
What happened to my mini-pool table? I was training to be a mini-pool hustler.	And Dad donated something, too.
I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.	We sold it to pay for a family cruise!
Oh, Marge... your names...	It's weird to hear myself saying this, but... I love you guys. This is gonna be the best vacation ever!
"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?"""	Oh, Marge... your names...
Why does every sand castle require my participation?	"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?"""
Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...	Why does every sand castle require my participation?
...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!	Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...
And here's the worst part: I never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!	...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!
WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT! WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT!	Homer! This is bad for you, too!
Sex on a family vacation? I never thought such a thing was possible!	Homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.
And the ocean'll do all of the work!	Sex on a family vacation? I never thought such a thing was possible!
Ocean sex rules! Go to Hell, land sex!	Woo-woo-woo-woo!
"Boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."	Two diplomats' sons are in love with me. Who will I choose: Ghana or Portugal?
I'unno... Lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely.	Where did the ship stop again?
Worthless, worthless, worthless...	"So remember, rule number one is ""Always Have Fun""... because fun is the only thing that will keep us alive! Fun!"
Can I put my hand through you?	What a load of crap!
Yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill.	Bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths.
Man, I kicked butt in the gladiator arena today! I won the last package of hot dogs on the ship! I got robbed by marauders on the way home.	Uhhhhh... gotta go!
What about the duty-free stuff we bought?	After this I'll be lucky to get work on a clothing-optional, Jimmy Buffett cruise!
My booze and cologne!	Never Have Fun!
Yeah stupid, stop thinking about fun and have it!	Well sure life is full of pain and drudgery, but the trick is to enjoy the few perfect experiences we're given in the moment.
Now that's what I call going for a spin!	What a great ride.
Now that's what I call a snappy retort!	Now that's what I call going for a spin!
He turned that Russian guy into Swiss cheese!	Stradivarius Cain?! Nooo!
Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!	That's my hobby. This is my job.
Swiss cheese. Marge, how come you're not saying anything?	I couldn't have thought of that in ten thousand lifetimes!
Oh man, Marge is pissed. Look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head...	"There was enough talking during the movie! This date night was even worse than the date night we saw ""Date Night."""
That's what she said!	Just take me home.
Yeah.	Boy Homer, I gotta say, Marge looked pretty easy on the eyes last night. And I know eye-ease!
No, just my marriage.	Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?
But you said it so mean!	That's a good thing!
Eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin.	But you said it so mean!
Hey Marge, here's something that'll make you happy!	Eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin.
No, this is really good. I...	Not in the mood.
Now, listen, Lisa--	Nelson took my lunch money again!
Well, I just got...	No one will tell me if I'm a ghost or not!
Uh... I got... Shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.	Got what, Homer?
But you're not...	Homer, I'm a single mother trying to raise a family here.
I have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know.	Just zip it!
Honey, I'm off to work!	Woo hoo!
I get it. You need your Marge time. Well, I'm off to work.	I have to take Maggie for her checkup. And a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn't wanna be with me.	Hey, Homer. I could hear your pathetic rationalizing through the door.
I wish I could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.	There's more than I thought!
Stradivarius Cain!	Stranger things have happened, Homer.
What the? Am I losing my marbles?	Stradivarius Cain!
Sorry.	C'mon! Really? Show a little class.
What the? No one can see you.	Now I'm about to undertake my toughest mission ever: to make you into a man your wife can't resist.
Yeah, Dr. Cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons.	I must say, whoever installed your car's secret weapons did a great job hiding them.
Sometimes Marge says I turn it into a trashcan.	What?! Well, does your car at least turn into something else?
Sounds like you're turning into wife number two.	Homer, you are going to clean up this car, put on cologne, and become a sparkling conversationalist.
But I'm a married man.	Now, the ultimate test: I want you to convince that woman to give herself to you body and soul.
Okay, I'll make a stranger love me forever.	Yeah. I know a married man is never attracted to a beautiful woman he doesn't even know, but this will give you the confidence you need with Marge.
My dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'Cause your hair looks really messed up.	And Homer, remember: it doesn't matter what you say, as long as you say it with confidence.
You know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?	Okay, it matters a little what you say. Moving on...
When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes.	Look, just say this
What do I do? What do I do?	Busy day at work? Did you get a lot of work done, workerman?
You're right, Marge. I lied.	Take her by those shoulders she never covers, and tell her the truth.
I got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation.	Don't give me that load of--
And I spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. The kind of husband you deserve.	Head injury?! Why didn't you tell me?
The three of us are going to the most romantic restaurant in town.	Kiss her. Kiss her while I watch.
I have bug-bombed the car for m'lady.	This car's so clean! I'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!
It was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. Of course she fell for me and of course I wanted no part of her. Now, the only one who can help us is Stradivarius Cain.	Why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love?
I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!	The guy from the movie?
No... not you... next... big fan but no... Cleatus the Football Robot, you're my only hope!	I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!
No one likes you!	No... not you... next... big fan but no... Cleatus the Football Robot, you're my only hope!
Strad, where are you?	How can a fat man hide so well?
When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes.	You can handle him, Homer. Just remember what I taught you.
We used to be like them.	Then why did he say he'd call me when he comes to Bolivia?
Actually, I was supposed to be back last week. We'll just wait for the call from human resources.	So, how many more weeks do you have off?
Well, I better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy.	I prepared right!
I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.	Why do we have to audition for this stupid play and Dad gets to leave?
Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories...	Also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!
Game Six of the 2011 World Series...	"""Krusty Versus the F.D.A.""..."
...And Lenny's story about Cancun.	Hitler Mash-ups.
Just like me on Twitter!	He said simple things that many followed.
Woo hoo!	After an all-night dinner.
I'm your Jesus! Me!	Woo hoo!
What's that a reference to?	Well, congratulations, Homer. Guess this is just my cross to bear.
Ooh, nice and roomy. Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool.	What's that a reference to?
Yes, sweetie?	Dad?
Whee! Whee!	First of all, congratulations on getting the lead.
Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee.	I just hope you're gonna take this seriously.
Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?	It'll be fine. Just learn your lines.
What?! Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?	He's in every scene.
Thou sayest it!	"Hoo boy! Okay, be straight with me -- you can probably plead this down to crucifixion. Do you call yourself ""King of the Jews?"""
They cannot judge me. Only my Father can judge me.	Crucify him!
I'll take you with me, old man!	Crucify him!
Mmm, historically inaccurate.	I'll take you with me, old man!
Ooo!	Jesus was handed a heavy cross, and upon his brow was placed a crown...
What the?	...of thorns!
Tonight, you shall be at my right hand in Heaven.	This man is totally the son of God.
Outta my way, stupid Flanders!	Never again will I question...
Uh-oh.	Hey Dad, you remember when you said if Flanders got remarried you'd eat your hat?
Ooo, licorice!	Uh-oh.
Welcome to marriage! Another good man bites the dust.	Congratulations, you two! We're so, so happy for you!
I'm talkin' about this guy.	Homer!
I sure envy him.	I'm talkin' about this guy.
I mean I envy Flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. Let's put it to a vote, America.	Homer!
Bart! Don't call me that!	Yo, Homer! Mom says get your fat ass over to the Flanders'!
Why you little... they're both bad, and I suspect you know it!	Which one? Homer or fat ass?
People here do not respect boundaries.	Ned, Edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room...
Sorry.	Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?
Great, we'll take care of everything. We'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners.	Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun.
You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller.	We haven't taken in one car all day.
He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about.	Why does that make him right?
Oh Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies.	Bart, is there something you want to tell us?
Not according to the internet!	That is totally irresponsible parenting!
I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.	Where on the internet?
Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!	Why would you believe him?
And what he says is true because it's in all caps. Are you gonna argue with caps?	Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!
Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry.	Ned, I realized long ago, there are some things Homer and I will never completely agree on.
Don't tell me what our thing is.	It's angry.
"I've always said ""hungry""!"	It's about not agreeing on something.
I thought I heard clicks and pops!	I'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
Welcome, money-changers! You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H.--	Now in our fiftieth location in Springfield, Sleazy Sam would like to welcome our special grand opening star, Jesus.
Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?	Welcome, money-changers! You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H.--
WILL YOU STOP THIS STUPID CRAP? / I WANNA TAKE A NAP!	FIRST BASE, YO! / I LIKE CHRISTIAN RAP / A BIBLE ON MY LAP...
Where are they going with this?	No exceptions!
You wanna honk your jazz tube?	"Now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. I stopped reading after ""TOP STUDENT""."
I appreciate that.	What is the point? I think this is the end of me. All I had was my integrity. And now that's gone. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I try not to cry till you're asleep.
Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down.	Look, if I could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, I think I might have a chance to...
What are you talking about? Y-you're right!	It's not a frown. It is a straight line of resignation. Looks just the same upside down.
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!	What are you talking about? Y-you're right!
I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!	Dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help.
Hey Lisa, come on.	Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma! Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma!
No.	It's just human contact.
Wow. Wow. This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary.	Homer!
Can I just trim the hem?	Stop it, Homer! Some of that meat is me.
Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better!	Gaga-Gaga-Gaga-Gaga-Gaga--
Okay, I'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... I'm on the wrong tree... Okay, try again... here we go, okay...	Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better!
Lisa, can you come down?	Okay, I'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... I'm on the wrong tree... Okay, try again... here we go, okay...
I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say?	Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught.
Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.	Dad, thank you. Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful I have been. Which means I've got a train to catch.
I LOVE MY HOMER FACE YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID / RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT OF MY HEAD / STUBBLE, MUZZLE, OVERBITE, TWO EYES THAT REALLY BUG / THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS OF MY HOMER-RIFFIC MUG / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, / I SHAVE IT CLOSE, TRIM HAIRS FROM MY NOSE / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, I CLEAN MY EARS, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I HEARS / I LIKE MY / I LIKE MY / I REALLY LIKE MY HOMER FACE	"I'm speaking fast because I'm so excited. Seeing Maggie Simpson in her first starring role in ""The Longest Daycare"" in 3D before Ice Age Continental Drift, only in theaters! We've already done the hardest part: making the poster!"
There's the gap!	Homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!
Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream.	Oh man, Lisa's right -- none of these relationships lasted very long. Three days, one recess, half a field trip... why did I have to get so needy at the planetarium?
Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle.	Dad, can I ask you a question? How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?
Well... I also keep things interesting.	Is that the only reason?
You see? Hey, what are you looking at?	All right, who took the microwave?
Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing.	I'd better switch to the hard stuff.
Observe. Hey, it's me again. He's there, isn't he? Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I'm inside your closet.	Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing.
Hey, it's me.	Um, that's awesome. But I think I'll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me.
I was thinking about you. It's your birthday in like three, four months? Would it be weird if I threw you a party?	Hey, it's me.
...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus...	Bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money...
But they're playing the Purple Sox!	Well, don't buy 'em!
Lousy outdated relics! Boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to New York?	C'mon, Dad. You love New York. Now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated: Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium.
You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!	Keep your meathooks off my sister Marge, or my goons will do a soft-shoe on your solar plexus.
"I'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!"""	Tough cookie, huh? Well, watch me take a bite out of you!
You're sellin' milk, J.J., and I've got a sour stomach.	That's some lip ya got on ya. How'd you like me to stretch it like a rubber band and snap ya into last week?
It didn't feel like success.	"Homer, that sounds like ""The Sweet Smell of Success""."
Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses.	We're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
I didn't say I swapped our house.	But don't the people wreck your house when they stay in it?
Look at this place. Things have certainly changed since our ancestor Fievel came here.	New York style!
Yes, and now look at us. Only in America.	Fievel was a mouse in a movie.
Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart.	Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!
You do that.	Can't Dad take Bart while we seek out culture?
Do you know you're missing your clothes?	You do that.
All right, I'll spring for a cab.	I thought this was just a dream! Oh, man!
Much better.	All right, I'll spring for a cab.
Oh-oh-oh oh, thank God you woke up!	Hey!
You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream.	I guess my search for true love is doomed.
Why you little... where's that ice cream?	Keep my secret!
Damn you and your fluted neck!	Just once I'd like your father to be on a JumboTron for something good.
I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!	Can't move?
Go where?	Um... I've gotta go.
Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!	I can't.
Aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be.	Thanks, man.
Heh, no kidding, I saw your reviews.	"Well at least it didn't end as bad as ""Romeo and Juliet."""
I hope you enjoyed the show tonight. And if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of.	Hey! I specifically said no critics! This is outrageous! Ooh, but they like me!
Do we screw them on the credit?	The best submission will be animated and appear on the show!
Lisa! Do you have a stray dog down there?	I's poor and shackless.
Two stray dogs?	Um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog.
That was gonna be my next guess!	It's a black hole!
Maybe.	"Are you sure your next guess wasn't ""three stray dogs?"""
A black hole? I'm sorry, can we call it that?	Maybe.
Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H.	Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes.
Woo hoo!	Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H.
Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!	Guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!
Why should--	Dad, don't pat it!
I am nature's perfect choking machine!	Why you little...
Sorry.	Dad, that's creepy.
Nope. / Not me. / Do we even still have that thing?	The black hole is looking a lot bigger. Does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
"Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me."	Now what?
Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old--	Zune... Zune... Zune...
Day one.	Zune...
We've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.	Day one.
And if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero.	We've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.
A hero.	You tossed your car keys in my bean plant!
Hero away!	Homer! Is that my camera?
Night One. Wanna snuggle?	Hero away!
I turned it off.	Not with the camera on.
I swear, I am not filming.	Looks like the red light's on.
Note to self: edit out my lies.	I swear, I am not filming.
What the?	I'm right behind you, honey! We have stairs?!
Oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now go to bed.	I don't know, I don't know! I'm sure I don't know!
Eh-eh, school night.	But--
Now you're sure I bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost?	Eh-eh, school night.
Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre.	Sir, whatever happens in this house, these cameras will pick it up.
Hey, Marge.	Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre.
Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy.	Not the favorite! Not the favorite!
Is there any other deal that you can accept?	Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy.
You, me and Marge?	Three-way.
Now, before we start, what's the safe word?	I guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...
Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind...	Cinnamon.
Cinnamon!	Cinnamon / Cinnamon / Cinnamon!
Would you go to the prom with me?	I'm your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun!
I'll get right on it.	Homie, the faucet is dripping.
I'm on it!	Homer, when are you going to fix this faucet?
For the third time this year, yes!	Are you going to fix the faucet or not?
I gotta hand it to you, Marge. You got the exact amount of car for our family. Room for two adults, three kids, and zero Grampas.	I have two Yorkies, and I'll be talking about you, to them, tonight!
Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.	Darn car won't start.
Well...	Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.
So, you're not totally unqualified.	Sir, the car is fine. Can I be straight with you? As a mechanic, I'm not totally qualified to judge mental health...
A reason? What could it be?	I think the problem is in your wife's head. There's a psychological reason why she hates this car.
Wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth.	I'm sorry, but there's no diagnostic computer for the female mind.
Umm... no thanks.	I don't do laundry or kiss boo-boos!
"Marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? Um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?"	Umm... no thanks.
Well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. When do you think things first went wrong?	What are you talking about?
No, no, Marge. I want you to explore your feelings.	All right, I remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. I mean, I don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. With this car, we're basically saying no more babies!
"An ""on purpose"" baby?"	Homer, the reason I hate this car is... I think I want another baby!
"What about... you know... ""Stinky""?"	Homie, I want another baby.
Just appreciating how lucky I am to be with you.	Homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what I say?
And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight.	My husband and I have been snuggling six ways from Sunday...
X's for eyes...	Take a look at this.
Honey, I am so sorry. I guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have.	I guess... that's that, then.
Sorry guys. Private family moment.	Is everything okay over here?
Eh, nothing we can do.	Yeah. That's why I wrap my plums in tin foil every day.
It's true... that's how I got the money to buy you your necklace.	You never told me about that.
I, uh, hope it's twins!	Awww... Eww... Homie! We still have a chance!
Watch it!	Okay.
Okay, but just for a minute. We want to hit the candle store, Fudgerama, the Zipper Hall of Fame, Snow Globe World, and The Taj Meatball.	Ooh, a Christmas ornament museum! Can we stop?
And I got to try every flavor of candy cane: white and red.	I can't believe we spent the whole day here.
What's that, baby?	Ooh, Homie, you've lost weight.
Yeah, no kids to ruin it.	It sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda.	I thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.
Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born.	So, you don't want another baby? How long have you felt this way?
Room for one, please.	Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born.
Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids.	Room for one, please.
Emotionally, financially, the boy... I just didn't know how to tell you.	Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids.
Okay, good, we're talking...	Just yell across the house like you do everything else!
Your phone just dialed me.	We're not talking!
Hey, the pocket wants what it wants.	You were pocket-dialed!
Uh-oh. I don't think I rewound the video the last time I was here.	Here he is!
Um, I'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a Simpson, Homer. Or it may be under the name Thad Supersperm.	Uh-oh. I don't think I rewound the video the last time I was here.
I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect.	Homer... Homer, this is the point where I really have to know what you want.
Are you sure there isn't more? I mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.	Nice speech, but the last of your sample was just selected by another couple.
Well, I expected a little argument.	Here, it's yours. We don't need it.
Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman, but I'm all right.	No, no, no, look in the mirror, that's your argument.
Um... remember that Corvette I had?	Homer? How many samples did you sell?
This is the worst pain imaginable!	I thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
Exactly. Well, we're all set. Let's make a Thad Supersperm Junior. With a name like that, he could be president.	This is the worst pain imaginable!
But I was really looking forward to...	Maybe there's enough Homer in the world for now.
You're right, Marge. I don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids.	But I was really looking forward to...
Two adults, please.	You're right, Marge. I don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids.
Another thing that would be harder with four kids.	Enjoy the film, you two!
I don't recall that.	Homer! Dr. Hibbert told you to eat healthier!
One onion rings, please.	I paid him to build a shed! Where is my shed, Bernice?
My burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, I talk about how much money I'm going to make from the lawsuit.	Mr. Simpson, your injury was no accidénte, it was... negligénce.
Oh God! It hurts worse than the burns!	"They have healed much too quickly. Sit still while I give your head the ""third degree."""
Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa.	So, uh, what are you gonna do with the money, Homer?
I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up.	So where's the money now?
Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?	Yeah, when you give the bank your money, they lend it to other people! I saw a Sesame Street about it! Kermit was wearing his trench coat and everything!
That settles it. No banks for me.	All the frogs on that show are Kermit. Keeps all the other frog actors out of work.
What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.	I'll tell you where you should put your money. The one safe place left in this world of woe:
A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?	Nah, you don't have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can't get its grubby little hands on it!
Open file, click and...invested! Hey Lisa, check out your college fund!	Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the third world, we're doin' great!
It's a classy operation. See, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. Cute.	You put my college fund on a poker site?!
On a poker site!	Well... at least I have a college fund!
On a poker site!	More importantly it's a college fund...
Sorry. Check out my new t-shirt.	Dad, please!
I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened.	Where'd you get that shirt?
That's one way to avoid drunk driving.	I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened.
I'm not Superman.	Another way is don't drink.
Ha, of course I do! Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?	Homie! Do you know what yesterday was?
What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!	Yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit Grampa!
Okay, remember the plan. Apologize to Grampa. Then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot.	What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!
Marge, you take that back!	I still feel guilty. Your father's not going to be around forever.
You take that back!	Fine, he'll be around forever.
We're here to see Abe Simpson.	You take that back!
Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?	I'm very sorry to tell you your father... is missing.
Oh, it's hopeless! This room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. By which I mean every museum.	There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. Spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy...
So precious...	Grampa's army footlocker! I bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!
Look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor.	So precious...
Flimsy lead, take me away!	The place that changed my life?
Excuse me, have you seen this man?	Can't let Lisa lose her sense of wonder.
I'm just trying to get information -- like a nosey reporter, or an undercover cop...	We don't like questions, man.
Or a spy from a rival gang! Hey, what are you doin'?	What'd he say about a cop?
Did you say my dad worked here?	Welcome to Spiro's! I am Spiro. Not the Spiro on the sign -- that's my brother.
Wait a minute!	Napas To Thailo Valka!
My dad was an aspiring songwriter like Charles Manson? I never knew that.	Wait a minute!
Now, what was that singer's name again?	Got it. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
Rita La-what?	Rita Lafleur.
One more time.	Lafleur.
Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.	I'll write it down for you.
That's where we live!	There's exactly one Rita Lafleur living in Springfield!
Woo hoo! I get two Christmases!	Homer, she's married to your Dad!
I can't believe my Dad never told me he had another wife. The man I looked up to my whole life.	The Bible is rich with trivia!
Well, it's a good thing I didn't because I'd be pretty devastated right now.	You never looked up to him.
But we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. And fast!	Well, we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain.
Well just what attracted you to my father?	But we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. And fast!
I was alive when my Dad knew you?	Faster than you'd think...
My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!	I love men on the rebound. They always think they've done something wrong and they usually come with furniture.
Hey, I'm startin' to remember why I don't remember so much.	We got married in the city hall across from the prettiest church you've ever seen. Then tragedy struck.
Oh my God. I never knew the sacrifices my father made. Move over, Fonzie. I've got a new hero.	Shame! Shame!
Holy moly.	I'm sorry I couldn't help you find your father. If you find him, tell him I can still do this. Yeah.
That's Dad's cologne? I always thought it was his old-man stink.	And tell him to put on a splash of this.
Man, you're making me hot for my Dad.	When I knew him, it was young-man musk.
Listen, do you know this man?	Only place in town that still sells Chicory Mist. After people found out it's ninety-eight percent squirrel sweat, they sorta stopped buying.
Dad!	Oh, I know him. He's a man who has no son!
Dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again.	Abe, we were so worried.
What?!	I didn't wander off, ya big fat salami! I ran away!
And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox.	Grampa, we will never miss a visit again. And there'll be a lot more of them.
Aww.	Well... when you put it that way... all right. I can't say all is forgiven, but most is forgotten.
I'm payin' for 'em.	Don't take Grampa's meds!
That's how wolves die in the wild.	MY HEART DOES THE TWO-STEP WHEN YOU WALTZ IN THE PLACE / YEAH, MY TICKER BEATS QUICKER WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR FACE / YEAH YOU'D BETTER CALL THE DOCTOR BEFORE WE EMBRACE!
The day my Frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...	It's beautiful!
He's a good boy.	And when you threw your son after it, I enjoyed meeting him too.
What I wouldn't give for an anvil to fall on me.	I know this music! It was a Bugs Bunny!
A perfect storm?	Sh! Here comes Lisa's solo!
When I prayed for this concert to be over, I didn't mean like this!	Lisa!
I am turning my back, because I can't stand to look you in the face.	"Well, well, if it isn't Mr. ""Work Comes Before Bowling."""
Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.	LISA EATS BU-UGS...
Come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?	Lisa... would you like some shrimp?
Hi... Dan.	Sorry, sorry. First of all, hi.
Doodie.	Secondly, remember when you asked who I worked for, and I wouldn't say? I'm a mob boss! I'm running Fat Tony's gang while he's on jury duty!
Oh?	Homer, that's not the shocking part.
Oh my God! You want me to help you escape?	He wants me to kill a bunch of guys! I've got a gun! Look!
You wha?	No! I want you to stop me from doing it!
In my business I try not be seen. I'm scary good at it.	I want to do it, Homer. It's the ultimate business model!
Please stop. I just wanted my Frisbee back from your yard.	Everything's led to this. I remember the first time I fired someone face to face. I cried. I cried! Saved the tear.
This is how I get out of doing the dishes.	They fired me for not being tough! I had learned that in order to succeed, you must disregard the dangerous distraction of being human. And it brought me here. You scratch a businessman and you get a coldblooded killer. Well I've been scratched!
Okay, I don't, I don't know why I said it... I was scared... I needed a response... it was a perfect storm!	I hate that expression! So overused!
My Dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. And now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. So this should work!	Adrenaline junkie.
Could you please not sound like you like it so much?	Yeah! That's right! Tie 'em tighter! Mmm! Oh, that's good! Oh, that burns!
Now stay down here and I'll be back every hour with food, and every six hours with food for you.	Sorry, I'm into a lot of weird stuff.
Will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?	I really think that's coming from our house.
That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Director's Training Program!	Homer, pay attention!
Now how would you qualify for that?	How 'bout the Disney Minority Program?
Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.	I'm the son of an oaf.
Dinner time! I know you're hungry! I can hear you rubbing your legs together! Oh my God!	Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.
I never thought Homer Simpson would be a part of the Day of the Locust.	Dinner time! I know you're hungry! I can hear you rubbing your legs together! Oh my God!
Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?	Now turn around and get on your knees.
I'll fix that later!	No. I just know it takes you so long to get up I'll have plenty of time to escape.
On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!	There's a great one, but you'll never get it outta me!
Stop!	You think you're so smart, Alex Trebek. I remember when you were Alphonse Trebagoogoo.
Dan!	I'll have your money in an hour.
You really should tweet less.	How do you keep finding me?
Huh? What?	You really should tweet less.
Just listen. If you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are.	But everyone deserves to know what I'm thinking all the time.
Look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. Give it to me!	I don't think so. They've killed a lot of people. And they tell their wives they're working, but they're really just hanging out.
I knew you were weak.	Aw, I can't kill you.
You are weak, but no.	If you think I'm so weak, give me back the gun.
No, I don't want to.	Let's see how weak I am with the gun.
I don't want to see it!	Give me the gun.
You're making me mad and I want, I want to shoot you now! / I don't have to see it.	I don't want to see it!
Give it to me! / I can imagine it. / Give me the gun! /	You're making me mad and I want, I want to shoot you now! / I don't have to see it.
Come on weakling, get it from me.	Give it to me! / I can imagine it. / Give me the gun! /
Yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now.	I'm not, you wanna, I'm not weak with the gun!
Well, you ain't so--	If I have a gun, I'm not weak at all!
Marge, in a crisis like this, I need time for quiet contemplation.	While you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house.
I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. Maybe I could drink myself to death.	What's wrong, Homer? You've got an expression on your face I ain't never seen before. Like one of them Charlie Brown wiggle-frowns.
Life is too fragile. One minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer.	Ooh, someone is down in the Duff!
Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?	Janette, Cheryl, get your own ride home.
Now what?	This is where the pretending ends.
Can this day get any worse?	You're coming with us to the school fundraiser.
Dogs can't get mumps.	The dog's got the mumps.
Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money down the drain, sweetie. I never win anything. It's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of.	I bought you a ticket for the MyPad raffle, Dad.
Here it comes...	And the winner is...
Get him! I mean, woo hoo!	...Homer Simpson!
I left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.	Greetings, I am Steve Mobbs, welcoming you from beyond the grave.
I don't wanna.	Submit.
I submit! I submit!	Or you could buy something from Hewlett Packard.
Oh yeah!	That adult Etch-A-Sketch certainly has brightened your mood.
"You can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""Tapped Out."""	Oh yeah!
Virtual Stapler!	"You can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""Tapped Out."""
Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. Here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache.	Virtual Stapler!
I'm Sonny Bono. Watch out for that tree!	Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. Here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache.
But I'm not alone. I'm doing some Face Time with Lenny.	Here ya go, Homer. Boy, y'know, when you're just here alone, I can really smell ya.
The old stupid moustache'll win him over.	Put that down! We're being audited!
I'm really stupid.	The old stupid moustache'll win him over.
I'm standing by that.	Is that the MyPad you're claiming as a business expense?
Sorry, boss.	Put down your MyPad and get back to work.
Woo hoo!	Awesome!
"Will you kids pipe down! I'm trying to get ""Churro-Chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. What country is Mexico in?"	Dad, I'm walking on my hands, and the lions think they're gonna eat me!
Okay.	Dad, pay attention to your children!
Aww. That'll be my screensaver.	Okay.
Why you little...	Gotcha!
A paper-based read-a-majig? What are we, cavemen?	Homie, you want to read to Maggie before she goes to sleep?
What would you have me do? One basket for each egg?	Homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.
"Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, ""Krusty's Kosher Karnival""...""Words With Enemies""...""Don't Burn the Toast!"", ""Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break,"" ooh, ""Pizza Clock""!"	Hm, I guess you're right. I guess I'll have to scratch that off the list of things I say.
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping! Having fun, Maggie?	"Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, ""Krusty's Kosher Karnival""...""Words With Enemies""...""Don't Burn the Toast!"", ""Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break,"" ooh, ""Pizza Clock""!"
How long have I been playing?	Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping! Having fun, Maggie?
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.	How long have I been playing?
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.	So, that's how you make a pizza! Oh, we have really been off-a the mark.
Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!	Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.
Flushy! Go get help!	Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!
It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!	Homer, you're gonna be fine. But there's no hope for the MyPad.
Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?	This is the part of the job I hate most. Talking to crazy people.
Oh Lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. Then you switched it off knowing full well I had declined thy infernal Mapple Care. Please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. And please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen.	Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Everybody hear that?	Amen.
Keep your pants on, Flanders.	Homer! Homer! It's a miracle!
Has the MyPad risen?	Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!
This is your miracle? A tree? Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop.	Here it is. The Holy Ooze.
"Huh. ""Hope."" Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?"	Look a little closer.
Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?	Well... I like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles I could mention. Passover.
Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.	Don't eat the miracle!
Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!	Huh. Looks like you're really turning somethin' over in your mind there, Homer.
To hope!	Here you go. Duff Adequate.
Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope.	Of all the gifts the Lord gives us, perhaps the greatest is hope...
Hope is here, people, and it's real. It's not just inside the house of God, it's outside the house of me! So come and see the sticky brown truth!	But I was just... oh, fine. I can get an early start on mountain biking.
Hope is all around me!	Hope is here, people, and it's real. It's not just inside the house of God, it's outside the house of me! So come and see the sticky brown truth!
As promised: the miracle!	Hope is all around me!
I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. Is that a two-one-two?	Homie? Aren't you going to come in?
Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain.	Don't call Satan! So what if the message wasn't a miracle? The answer isn't in syrup from God or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real.
Who do you think painted the word on the tree?	Homie, you have such a way with foods. Let's go inside.
Guess it must've been the person who knew I needed hope most of all.	No idea. The important thing is that they did.
Bart, stop it! You might fall!	No.
Grampa?!	What a lucky little boy to get a trip to the park with his grandpa.
This boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! I am his father... I can't believe I allowed you to hit on me.	Oh my God! Should I call an ambulance? Help! An old man is dying!
Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!	This boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! I am his father... I can't believe I allowed you to hit on me.
Old man... I'm not an old man... This drawing doesn't think I'm old.	Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!
Don't you, drawing?	Old man... I'm not an old man... This drawing doesn't think I'm old.
Those aren't our regular donuts! They're huge... with crazy toppings! Gummy worms! Churro chunks! Russian nesting donut!	Don't you, drawing?
Gotta eat the rest!	Those aren't our regular donuts! They're huge... with crazy toppings! Gummy worms! Churro chunks! Russian nesting donut!
They're gone!	Gotta eat the rest!
"Where did these ""Devil Donuts"" come from?"	They're gone!
Get lost, pervs!	"What about ""thunderbags?"""
Okay, where did you get these donuts?	Get lost, pervs!
I'm calling to report... a missing donut cart.	Nine one one. What is your emergency?
No, no, nothing, nope.	"""But, Chief, the power lines."" Go lower!"
I see... devil horns!	No, no, nothing, nope.
... pitchfork, pointed tail... hooves are... cloven! We have logo, people. We have logo!	I see... devil horns!
No more donuts?	Sorry gents, we're fresh out. I only make one batch a day, and when they're gone, I'm done.
Beer keg do-nut?	Tell you what... I could give you a sneak preview of a new donut that's still in the R & D phase.
I would be honored to shake the hand that glazed this.	Beer keg do-nut?
Tell me everything about you.	I'm Terence.
You're from Portland? I've heard of people being from there.	Tell me everything about you.
Wait a minute, you have kids?! You can't have kids! Look at you!	Yeah, but Portland just got too played out. The city used to be real. Did you know there are now restaurants there with two locations? Not near my kids.
You have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not Halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt...	Wait a minute, you have kids?! You can't have kids! Look at you!
No one would ever think you're a lame old man.	You have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not Halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt...
Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.	"You can't let being a dad slow you down. Me and the fam are doing the whole ""urban nomad"" thing, you know, just looking for an undiscovered city with affordable houses."
Please. Please rush into this! Please rush into this!	Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.
In my house, we found human bones.	What a find! Underneath all the ugly renovations, this house has Neutra bones.
Really? I'm... ...cool? Oh, can I man-hug you?	Thanks for turning us on to this place, Homer. You're a pretty cool guy.
I don't know how.	Sure.
"Okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. I've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, I assume -- so don't screw it up."	I don't know how.
Great, Marge, now that's in their heads.	Relax, kids, just be yourselves.
"""Star Wars"" Chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary."	"Hey, this is my armadillo, Chewy. ""Mexico"" Chewy, not ""Star Wars"" Chewy."
"""T-Rex?"" Even their names are cool! This is, umm... Ice Cream, Bungee Jump, and... Viral Video."	Neighbors, I get it.
Check out my new look!	Homer, I think we should go. We're not like these people.
Terence shaved my head!	Check out my new look!
"No, I'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. I never want to see these again."	You're all bald!
Check it out, Flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. Guess I can't be your best friend anymore.	"No, I'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. I never want to see these again."
Boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. It's not gonna win me back.	To be honest, that comes as a tremendous relief.
I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end.	Maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. You know, we might not all be a perfect match.
Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip.	Well sweetie, if it's that important to you, I guess we can try.
No, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. That's Terence's parenting style--	The kids are a mess! You brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches.	Parenting shouldn't have a style! Parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! Are you wearing a wallet chain?! You look like... a barista!
Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. The. Essence.	And what's with the scarf? It's soaked in neck sweat.
I hope T-Rex likes the present I made him.	Oh man, my goatee has barely come in. Why does my hair only grow in twos?
"Homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. If I show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then I've failed! And these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!"	Made? Why didn't you just buy him a toy?
T-Rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.	Yeah, this factory used to make blimp tires.
I thought it made blimp tires!	Your son attacked mine! You've turned this former slaughterhouse into a place of violence!
Are we still on for midnight bike riding?	It's time for you guys to leave.
O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.	"Have you been ""oh boy""-ing all night?"
He called me... a poser?	Look. That kid threw your present in the garbage, and he called you a poser and everyone laughed!
You? Sticking up for your old man? You've never done that before.	Yeah, I was sticking up for you.
What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?	Also, I didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because I don't breastfeed!
They can goatee... hell!	What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
Yeah, that's right, the friendship between the Simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!	They can goatee... hell!
Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!	I want my moustache stencils back.
Could we at least agree to both hate Flanders?	"I just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""The Feud Network"" to ""Comity Central."""
Shut up with your names!	I like him. He talks in rhyme and owns a whimsical store in a failing mall. He's like the dad in a Wes Anderson movie.
"Parenting? Let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. Parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! It's nature's way!"	Well, we were just questioning the parenting that led to Bart not using his words with Tyrannosaurus.
Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave.	Yes, but there's two sides to every--
Oh no, it's true!	"We're not going anywhere. Our house just got written up in ""Dwell."""
What happened here?	Stupid town... at least I've still got Moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going...
Oh, Marge, it's bad.	More manchego, Aziz?
I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!	The cool people are everywhere! Somehow they've even made the weather rainier!
It's a hellhole!	I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!
What happened to our town? Everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!	Disco Stu has found a new thing!
Okay, you win. We don't have to be friends, but can we live on the fringes of your world? Like those eels that eat whale poop?	Screw that, it's Krusty time.
Your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!	Sorry, our old-timey fire bell spooked the horses, and they ran away.
They're necessary! They're necessary!	The net of scarves and wallet chains is holding!
They're finally necessary!	They're necessary! They're necessary!
I did it! I did it! I man-hugged!	I guess I do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids... except Lisa. I breastfed Lisa for nine months.
Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt.	I've labeled all his boxes!
Oh no! I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa!	You know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt!
Hold down the fort?! With my bad back?!	Fine. Just stay here and hold down the fort.
"""Villageville. Build your own authentic medieval village."" I must have something better to do."	Man, that keyboard playing cat is so cute.

Finally, a woodcutter that will do what I tell him.	And ca-lick!
Holy moley! He's already made a clearing! Let's go for a glade!	Finally, a woodcutter that will do what I tell him.
Just call me DeForest Kelley. I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.	Holy moley! He's already made a clearing! Let's go for a glade!
Move this here. Tap. Mill! Mill! Barn! Silo! Tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! Brothel. Parsonage! Theater In The Round! And... hay pile...	Just call me DeForest Kelley. I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.
And the Lord saw what he had made, and it was good.	Move this here. Tap. Mill! Mill! Barn! Silo! Tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! Brothel. Parsonage! Theater In The Round! And... hay pile...
That's right, your Lord sticks his hand in his pants. And yes, it is the same hand I tapped you with.	Ewww!
Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore.	That's right, your Lord sticks his hand in his pants. And yes, it is the same hand I tapped you with.
You're back!	Maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.
It's real to them!	Did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?
I don't know -- the back yard?	Um... where's Santa's Little Helper?
Oh my God. I forgot to feed my jackass!	I don't see him anywhere. You jackass! You lost our dog!
You're hel-come!	Hank-hew!
Oh, right.	What the hell?
A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?	The animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. Just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon.
Good, Marge. Get their price down.	We don't want a raccoon.
Not a crier.	Hey, Lisa's right. You're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog.
Goofing on it made me feel wise!	What?! You cry all the time! You cried when they canceled that show you hated.
Prep, prep, prep...	And he didn't pee on the floor!
I believe the word is idiote.	I'll answer that: your father's an idjit!
I know what must have happened:	How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?
I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?	I know what must have happened:
Whoa, now I've gotta buy a corpse wagon. That's how they getcha.	I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?
It's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.	Whoa, now I've gotta buy a corpse wagon. That's how they getcha.
Oh yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees.	It's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...	Oh yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees.
A minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! Torture, torture, torture!	GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...
He knows I love him. And he loves me.	Hey Homer, how come you're not hugging the dog?
How are they his treats if I paid for them?	You never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. And I suspect you've been chewing on his treats.
Okay, okay. I'll be nicer to the dude. I've just never really been a dog person.	How are they his treats if I paid for them?
Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!	Really? What about Bongo?
Ever!	Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
He's still my dog!	Bongo was Homer's dog when he was a boy.
I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!	We got him years ago...
It doesn't make sense to me!	Grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?
I happen to remember it just a little differently.	It doesn't make sense to me!
Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say...	Well, tell us your version.
Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!	Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say...
Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--	Well I guess I could always drop a horse on a church afterward... fine.
And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part.	Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--
Wait. Wait. There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about: a few months later, I went to rescue Bongo...	Yeah, but at least it was short.
But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for...	Hendrix! C'mere, boy!
Bongo was happy. Without me. He had become her dog.	But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for...
Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made.	Oh Homie. I'm so sorry.
He still has my sweatshirt.	A Christmas card I got from Miss Viola years later.
Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now.	Bongo didn't forget you. Unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away. They were fickle as Hell.
Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?	All these years I thought you loved that dog more than me.
Okay, but I'm a little out of practice.	Aw, give me a hug, son.
What flavor?	Hold your arms like you're carrying a wedding cake!
If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers.	It doesn't matter!
My dog.	C'mon, boy. Time to go to bed.
Yeah, Mom, you promised!	"""Learn Zone?"" Mom, you said we were going someplace fun."
Sorry, Mrs. Simpson.	"Homer, I told you, don't call me ""Mom."""
Is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?	For maximum safety, all children must wear anti-kidnapping bracelets.
Feed it to the dog.	Dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?
Don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!	You'd have to wrap cheese around it.
Can't I keep an eye on that kid? He's fabulous.	Keep an eye on the kids, Homer.
It's always my kids.	Bart and Lisa.
Where'd they go?	It's always my kids.
Almost... holy moley...	Where'd they go?
What the--? Ooh, it's hopeless.	Almost... holy moley...
Who the hell are you?	What's hopeless?
Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!	Dad! / Come up! / Pretty please! / Come up!
Crawling... so painful...	Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!
...duck walk... infinitely worse...	Crawling... so painful...
Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace.	Only wanted... to be fun...
I made it, kids! I am king of Learning-ton Castle!	Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace.
Real matuuure!	We tricked you! / Eat Nerf, Homeboy!
What cool kid thing's in here?	Ralphie! Shoes.
Never!	Get out of there, you!
Butter.	Never!
What the hell was that?	Apes... deep down we're all savage apes. Leave your body, Homer.
Well, I've taken eight months off. It's time to get back on the horse.	You've been through a traumatic experience. Are you sure you wanna go to work today?
America can't collapse! We're as powerful as ancient Rome!	"It means ""without the rule of law."" Anarchy. The end of civilization. Coming soon to an America near you."
Sweet.	The modern world. An inexorable march of progress.
Oh my God! This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!	The man who is prepared.
Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys! Always partying on deck with your Docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!	Homer, meet the Springfield Preppers.
It's based on nothing!	"Not ""preppies,"" ""prepp-ers."" But I like your hatred."
I'd slash my wrists! But how, without my electric knife?!	A burst of radiation that knocks out every electrical system in the country.
I can't conceive of any.	There is an alternative to suicide.
Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.	All we ask is that you keep your prepping secret. We won't have room for all the unprepared.
Impending doom...	Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.
Just go play your saxophone while you can.	When grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about.
Secrets? I have no secrets! Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of. Smell some bread!	What does that mean?
Typical sheeple.	"When things go south, the ""sheeple"" will clean out every supermarket in town."
Maybe.	Are you eating my grain?
Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds. What's that about?	That was a five-pound bag!
I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.	Hey, Dad. Are we going camping?
I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies.	What's up? Going crazy again?
So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?	I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies.
"Hollywood has taught you well, my son. Now let's push ""play."""	"Guys who call themselves ""preacher"" or ""deacon"" are very bad. Water is money unless gasoline is money. And even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves."
Fridge-ra-torr!	Fridge-ra-torrs! Fridge-ra-torrs!
Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.	"Aren't they just saying ""refrigerator?"""
Wow. Your end of the world is better than my during the world.	Here it is, Homer. The Springfield Preppers' top secret Bug-Out Retreat.
Aw. Uh, listen, I've gotta know. You're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?	There's always one alarmist. Anyway, when the Four Horsemen ride, we want you and your collaterals right here with us.
It's okay. I know what I am.	Well, that is a big part of it.
Um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.	I can't find all our cereal, crackers, juice boxes, the butter brush...
I want to tell you but I promised to keep it a secret.	What move? We haven't moved! What's going on?!
It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.	You can't have secrets from your wife!
I've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.	It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
See? These are our bug-out bags. In here is everything we need to survive.	I thought the basement looked cleaner.
The looming kablooey.	Survive what?
Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon.	It's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. But this is all a little... creepy.
There's no handle on this side!	I'm going to bed.
The one thing I couldn't prepare for.	There's no handle on this side!
Marge, this is it! TEOTWAWKI!	There you have it. A town without rules, without leadership, without television. This is Kent Brockman, talking to himself.
Uh-huh, where's the kids?	The end of the world as we know it?
Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever.	Lisa and Maggie are downstairs, and Bart's in his room with Milhouse.
This is my daughter. She brings the gift of music to the new world.	See ya, Bart!
Baritone.	Is that sax alto or baritone?
Here's something to pass the endless time. Write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.	Dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? We're already bored.
Society will not have to start from square one.	Yes, sir.
Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me.	Homie, I never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble.
Well, just because I imagined it doesn't make it any less true. And now all those people are on their own.	No one was laughing. You kept it a secret!
If Jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.	How can you call yourself a Christian?
Why do we have to shoot them at all?	Boom.
No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!	Are you that good with a knife?
"Don't be silly, ""Mary Ellen."""	Every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities.
Now we're going to leave this place. I'm sorry, Bart -- I know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend...	"Don't be silly, ""Mary Ellen."""
White rice or brown?	I've got to be honest with you. It was just a bag of rice I drew a face on.
So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.	Good boy.
Hm. I cut the wires to something.	You said you cut the wires to the alarm!
Okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. If we miss it, we're dead.	Hm. I cut the wires to something.
How can that be? I took every last can of gas!	Dad, there are lights following us!
Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall.	How can that be? I took every last can of gas!
Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets.	Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall.
Now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy, starvation, and having sex for procreation.	Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets.
"You got to watch a VHS copy of ""Red Dawn"" thirteen times. Stop complaining."	Dad, you said people would be drinking each other's blood.
We can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?	That's just air escaping his lungs.
Good riddance. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest.	And this goes too.
Goodbye, my electrical friends. I can't afford to use you, so I'm doing what any good American would do -- throw you away.	His friends called him Pete.
Parking meter?!	Goodbye, my electrical friends. I can't afford to use you, so I'm doing what any good American would do -- throw you away.
And it still works!	Parking meter?!
This could come in handy. But let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses...	And it still works!
Parking meter, you're workin' for me now.	This could come in handy. But let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses...
Lotta people at the dump today.	Mannequin heads, you're working for me now.
This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!	Well, sir, the Lord wouldn't have placed His meter there if He didn't want me to park.
It's not that kind!	This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!
All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot.	It's not that kind!
Oh God, my back! Suckers! My discs are grinding! Easy money!	All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot.
We're cool, right boy?	Thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks.
Now to sleep the sleep of the just.	Nothing a few George Washingtons won't solve.
I'm king of the bus station!	They will be, Seymour. They will be.
Eat silver, copper!	You know what they do to parking meter thieves in prison? They probably treat 'em pretty well. But when you get out, you're not eligible for jury duty. Which again, sounds pretty good.
No, no! You're the first successful business I've ever run!	Stay with me, man. Stay with me.
The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did.	A pillowcase full of quarters?! Where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!
How long have you been in there?	The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did.
Woo hoo!	Well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!
...and I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana ... that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do ...	Woo hoo!
Way to get us back on topic, Marge.	And I hope Bart passes his test and saves the school.
Dear Lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to Oz, but don't let Flanders be the Scarecrow!	You live like this?
We made it, boy!	Dear Lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to Oz, but don't let Flanders be the Scarecrow!
The tornado took old what's-his-name! I'm going after him!	Oh my God. Oh my God. This counts as a walk!
Lenny, take us with you to find our dog! It's okay, Marge, they're professionals.	Hey, Homer! We were just doin' a little storm chasing.
Hey!	I'd say she's prettier than a surface hoar.
Maybe the last words I'll ever write.	--the sublimation of ice crystals that's colder than the frost point?
Maybe! Look, you guys obviously know about weather, but I understand something much more predictable: women.	Aw.
What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.	Maybe! Look, you guys obviously know about weather, but I understand something much more predictable: women.
That is the stupidest...	I'll tell you what women really want: a man who can hold a note the longest.
I would never do that.	Homer, you do not have to compete with your friends for me.
Fine. But I swear: I will win you back from Lenny.	Enough with the singing!
Help me, God! What is it I'm paying you for every Sunday?	It's gone!
Can always use... a good babysitter.	Help me, God! What is it I'm paying you for every Sunday?
He was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.	Oh my God! The twister got Carl, my best friend in the world! I can barely remember what he looks like.
Yes, it won't give!	Are you pushing?
Found another one.	Except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job.
Were you worried about me, boy?	Mom, I am so glad you're alive.
Clearly the boy's in shock.	Sure, why not?
Stop being blasé!	Oh yeah, I'm a wreck.
Now I know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. Just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes.	Never!
Connecticut?	Homie, if we did both die, we've never named guardians. The kids could end up wards of the state.
Okay, you're right. It's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but I think the choice is obvious -- my dad.	No, our state.
Good point. We'll find somebody else.	You'd let me have another chance after the way I screwed things up with you?
I got it, Dad.	Yup, you're a big bag of blubber soaked in worthless juice.
Oh yeah? The tornado was more of a father to me than you! Okay, how about my brother? He's rich.	Why I married you I'll never know.
Oh, how very kind of you. I am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! One lump, please.	Sugar?
That's some impressive flute-nastics.	And no resenting us ever!
Goodbye forever!	Didn't you want to ask us something?
All right, Marge. Maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. We'll take what we can get.	Someone's cranky.
Kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your Mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family.	With nametags on them?
This is not that! And that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you!	Oh, I see. You guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night, rolls over, and crushes mom.
"Okay, I'll nudge 'em with the car. We'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."	Homer! Dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!
Wait! What about that couple? They look pretty cozy.	Maybe we should just give up for now, have some fried clams and collect sea glass.
Wowww. Your house is perfect. No sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool Grampa...	Just for standing on a thing?
Ooh, Thanks, Dad.	I love two things: shutting up and giving away money.
Wow. I assumed The Jackson Five were the only perfect family, but now I see there's another.	It's a promise stone. It signifies that if I ever get to be a burden, I just jump in a volcano.
No, no, no. I meant pushing kids on swings.	With you guys? Uh... seems like my husband would be getting the much better deal.
Okay, take whatever time you need. I just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians.	Give me a minute to get some images out of my mind.
Man, you sure can talk surfer talk.	Babe, when a killer wave hits, you can't spend your whole life deciding if you want to drop in or not. It just might be the most righteous tube we ever shot.
Maybe this'll help you make up your mind.	Okay, we'll give some serious thought to taking them.
You never know when you might wanna mail something.	It's empty.
Worrywart Marge. You don't look a Trojan Horse in the mouth.	Homie... it's been a wonderful day... but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly?
I swear to you, Marge, when I have the time, I will Google them both.	But we know so little about them.
Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but I'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what I'm saying...	Hey, where's Bart?
Great. And now my Dad can notarize.	Both.
Name another.	I still have my uses!
Now I can finally complete my bucket list.	Well, I must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of.
Too late! You already signed! Oh wait, there's one more.	Homer, Marge... we have a favor to ask.
Suckers!!! Oh wait, you've gotta initial this.	Too late! You already signed! Oh wait, there's one more.
Check mate.	Suckers!!! Oh wait, you've gotta initial this.
Hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend.	A whole weekend? I don't know...
Marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit.	I guess. As long as we don't make it a habit.
It helps me write.	Do you have to do that in front of people?
Marge, this has been great couples time. The one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!	It helps me write.
I don't like the way they just rip the paper off. Santa's Little Helper my ass.	...so you will obey.
No one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that I never told you about... except I guess I just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!	Oh God! They want to steal our kids!
Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young.	That's why they took our kids so quick.
Oh yeah, man.	She's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.
Don't worry, Marge. We'll get 'em. Unless we die on this icy mountain road. Then they've won forever.	Oh yeah, man.
Women and their horrible thoughts.	Homie, I just had a horrible thought.
Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them.	What if they are better for the kids than us?
I've got a bone to pick with you! Then, an apology to make. Then, we exchange insurance information. Then, more bone picking!	Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them.
Those better be good breaks.	Homer, Marge... I understand your anger, but your kids are more awesome than the breaks at Waimea.
Sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?	Honestly, we fell in love with 'em and it seemed like you guys didn't really want 'em.
Well, I'm glad someone has.	Like clockwork.
We've won. Woo hoo.	Again?
Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living.	Kids, your father and I have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians.
Why you little...	If you call this living.
I do call this living! Living the way kids in India can only dream of!	Why you little...
I forget.	Win what?
Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time!	Turn right onto First Street, head east. Homer, watch the road! Not this road, the other road!
Finally! A supervisor!	Switching to male voice...
Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.	Mary?
If you're lucky, me, then this.	Bart Simpson, I don't know what the future holds for you...
Listen to your sister, boy.	Ew! On every level! Ew! Bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of Milhice. What? It's the plural of Milhouse. Look it up.
What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.	What I'm saying applies to you too, Dad.
It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?	Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?
How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.	Don't you see, you're taking women for granted. And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate.
Why you little... I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!	More like balder and wider.
You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!	I was the only one without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!	You should know that me saying I don't care means I couldn't care more.
Finally, we're gettin' somewhere.	All right. Fine. If you boys want it, I'll tell you what I really think.
Hand me my suitcase, boy.	You're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause I still like the dog.
When you're older.	When do I get a Krusty suitcase?
You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?	So this is where you go when Mom kicks you out?
I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!	We'll get right on it, Mr. Simpson.
Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.	What's this notice on the wall?
Oh, it'll happen again, son.	Aw, man! We just missed it.
Knock yourself out.	Um, I've gotta make a phone call.
Not again!	Knock yourself out.
I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.	MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, NOW I SEE HIS WARTS / I WISH HIM WELL, DOWN IN HELL, WHERE HE'LL EAT HIS OWN SHORTS! It just poured out of me, like venom from a snake!
Shows how much she... knooooows! It's hurting my eyes!	I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
"You know what we need? A classic ""kicked outta the house"" party. Now who's got a rockin' CD?"	Or getting her kid hooked on pot. She's my kid too, you know.
"That's it? Well, then let's ""power"" this party up!"	"I've got the audio book of Robert Caro's ""The Passage of Power."""
This calls for decisive action -- like L.B.J.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.	I miss Roxie. That's the club where I used to smoke pot with my kid.
The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!	But how do we figure out what to do?
Agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture.	Hard to believe that country used to rule anything.
After we finish watching the movie.	Hear hear!
I WROTE THIS SONG TO SAY I'M SORRY	"""You are invited to... a grand gesture?"" Oooh!"
THE MELODY IS BY BEETHOVEN	DAD, DON'T BE A CREDIT HOG
MARGE YOU WILL GET THE LAST PORK CHOP...	I'LL STOP EATING FROM THE GARBAGE
And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.	A completed chore list!
I think it's a Terence Malick movie.	Dad, what are you watching?
Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles.	No, you're watching Baby Poindexter, the most educational DVD available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store!
Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets.	What?!
I'm on it.	Homer, a little help?
If I buy you, why do I need all these books?	I'm on it.
Spot the Hidden Objects.	Sorry, folks. She doesn't even work here.
Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met.	Spot the Hidden Objects.
Gotcha! Candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see...	Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met.
"If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""	Have you seen Lisa and Maggie?
Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world.	Homie, help me find them.
Got 'em!	Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world.
Sure, what do I care?	He's right here.
Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.	Dad, why are you kowtowing to Mr. Van Houten?
Grownups have their reasons!	Dad?!
Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine?	Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad.
Where does it say that?	Homer, that's for children!
"""Highlights..."" ""for..."""	Read the rest of the title!
Leave it to me...	I lost my other earring.
...twenty-five dollar casino chip...	Wondered where that was.
Just my honey pie.	Can you find anything you like in this bed?
Wanna split it while we snuggle?	Just my honey pie.
Licking the wrapper.	Wanna split it while we snuggle?
Waldo. Waldo. Waldo.	But what if we can't afford not to buy it?
We'll get those kids back.	Homer, Bart said the kids were going to the Van Houtens, but Luann just told me they're supposed to be here. They've disappeared!
Because we just bought them new shoes!	We'll get those kids back.
Waldo. Waldo.	Because we just bought them new shoes!
How many kids will jazz corrupt?	Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to?
No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute.	Homie, do you see anything?
We've found what we're looking for.	When I said you needed a software update, it was not a criticism.
Sure, they could be here. Who knows?	The kids?
Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!	The top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
There's always a catch.	He's ten years old!
"It's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."	Is anyone here gonna buy a condo?!
Son, promise you will never look like me.	I'd like that.
Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!	I sure hope not.
I can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on TV.	Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs.	Hmm, you're right. It is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted TV shows.
Ooo! Jail music!	Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs.
I'll give it one marathon.	"This is... ""Storage Battles."""
No one feels out a unit like CJ! Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one!	Skinner!
Too late!	I want to know what it's for.
We're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! And dead people.	Too late!
There's other P.O.s? Uh-oh, better put on my game shades.	It looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.
One thousand dollars!	Six-fifty going once, six-fifty going twice...
In the money game, cash is king.	One-thousand-dollars-going-once-going-twice-sold-to-the-man-who-didn't-wait-for-the-bidding-to-get-anywhere-near-one-thousand-dollars!
You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.	We spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?
Feather boas?	I wasn't laughing -- I was being worried.
Tights? Robes? This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.	Makeup and baby oil!
Why would my man-dad have lady stuff?	"""Property of Abraham J. Simpson?"" This is Grampa's stuff!"
Beefcake mags?	It's not all lady stuff. Look at all these fitness publications.
That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.	I think your dad might be gay.
Those are pretty cute...	I think this is great! Old gay men are adorable! Like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.
My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy.	Your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. They even had a gay float in the Pride Parade last year.
Yeah. Gay rights are human rights, baby.	Oh Homie, you're so... enlightened.
It's okay, Dad. We know the truth, and we love you.	Abe... we found your storage locker.
Just admit who you are, and you can find new love.	What?! The contents of that locker are my private business! Get out!
No fatties!	Help me out of the closet! Wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.
Fine.	How about some fatties?
If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son.	I hope someone saw our ad.
Then how do you explain this?	What?! I don't ride side-saddle! I'm straight as a submarine!
Who?	You're Glamorous Godfrey!
You were a world-famous wrestler? Spill the beans, old man. Word beans!	Thank you.
Those things?	All right, I'll tell ya... It was the 1950s...
I don't know. Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?	Excellent. So we'll take the boy and make a night of it.
Text me the choices.	I'll bring you home my dessert.
Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. Just like you and me. Swear to God.	"""Gorilla Joe,"" ""Gorilla Sam,"" ""Gorilla Pete,"" ""Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins""... Where did Mr. Burns dig up all these old wrestlers?"
Fine.	Can I have one! Can I?
Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!	Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!
No I don't. If you pray to Superman.	Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!
Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?	Well sure I am. I always thought Grampa was lame, but he's really awesome!
"You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"	Burnsy, I can't remember the last time I was so happy.
It's found footage!	Who would film such a thing?
How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!	So what! We could use another winner in this family.
Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!	Wrestle with Bart? He ain't beefy, but he is infuriating and you can't teach infuriating. Monty, you're a genius!
Why does everything I forbid always happen?	Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!
He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!	Why are you so mean to me?
I wish Grampa was my dad.	Oh, that was so sweet.
Hey Flanders. Can I borrow some sugar?	It's not chinchilla. I just thought she needed more sleep.
A little cream?	Sure!
Now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, I'll be on my way.	Goes with the sugar!
Are your kids gonna be there?	Why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
Okay.	Eh, for a little bit.
Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress.	Now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!
This room just got a whole lot cooler.	There's no emergency here! And please charge us for the false report! I'm going out for a power walk.
Yeah, it's medicinal. We had a pain in our neck.	Homer! I can't believe you're partaking with my parents!
But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.	Homer... you'll need to wear this eye patch for a couple weeks... and you may never see a film in 3-D again.
What about Christian Archie comics?	Not praying to a character in a comic book.
Here, I'll get you started. Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name... one nation, under Zod...	Neither canonical nor comical.
Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge.	Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now. More than his eye, I think you hurt his feelings.
Your famous murmur. You know .	My what?
I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job.	Nix! She's already got two weeks tenure so she's impossible to dislodge.
"Oh yeah. I say ""union"" you say ""power""! Union..."	Homer, that's you.
Union!	Power.
"Marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" But don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. So, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"	Power.
We really appreciate that.	We should talk about what we're going to promise to do, not what we'll actually do.
Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.	Homer. Homer! I found the answer!
Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!	"""Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."""
Just what do you want?!	I would embrace such a glad visit!
So, you went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive.	I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew.
C'mon, man. What's the catch?	Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!
Hmm...	Homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause I'm on the level. Punch me.
I'm not punching you, Flanders.	What's this about a fisting?
Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels.	What? Why?!
It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!	No! You can't! If I'm not as good as you... then I'm horrible!
Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!	Now, there's no need to...
You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man.	Enough!
I didn't know you were left-handed.	Now you're rhyming?!
Help me, Flanders!	Fear not, people. I will lead you safely across.
What's wrong, Sweetie?	...which Wikipedia defines as a strong, resilient water-resistant material. That definition is a hit with no errors!
Even after we came to school?	My teacher's still bullying me.
Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!	That just made it worse.
I think I have an idea.	Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!
Flanders, I've come to forgive you.	You know, the great Mel Ott used to raise ducks in Louisiana during the off season. And when a duck got sick he would take it to bed with him until it got well. Mm-hm.
But, there is one condition...	My prayers have been answered! Well actually, just this one.
Don't wanna hit you. I want your wife.	Now you can shatter my orbital bone! That'll knock the wax off my candle!
How much plutonium do you want? Gotta warn you, it might take me twenty minutes to get it.	There's only one way: the nuclear option.
This is praying?! Let me outta here!	How long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?
Help me God!	This is praying?! Let me outta here!
I don't like the sound of that funeral march.	You guys, I swear I didn't do it.
Okay! I'll pay for your damn band candy! What was it, seventeen hundred dollars?	I don't like the sound of that funeral march.
Now do me wearing a sombrero!	Forget the candy! We're here to turn this...into this!
Now have me sleeping under a cactus!	Now do me wearing a sombrero!
All too well.	Wow -- he passed the Maggie test. And remember how Maggie solved Cookiegate?
Son, if there's one thing I've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! It's so frickin' boring! Run, boy! I'll create a distraction!	"I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of ""Rubber v. Glue"" and reaffirmed by ""I Know You Are v. What Am I."""
It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.	Will the defendant please rise?
Keep it under your hat, guys, but I've got a date with a married woman.	"What do women want? Throughout the her-story, that's right I said her-story, of planet Herth -- men have attempted to answer that question and failed. Or should I say ""maled?"""
Her husband's gonna be there too.	Let me guess: is it Marge?
Give up? It's Marge -- I'm having a lunch date with my wife.	Got it. You and Marge.
Date with my wife.	Good one. / Yeah, you got us, man.
When we got married I promised you a life full of romance. Now here it is.	This is the coolest sushi restaurant in town! It got three-and-a-half stars in the Springfield Tire Guide!
Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others.	Tip included!
Oh yeah.	So without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.
Beats drowning.	Uh, I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons.
What? What? You're interesting. Why would you say that?	I think I'm interesting!
Words hurt, you know.	Can you chew with your mouth closed? It's like looking into a garbage disposal.
Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus.	The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the reservation.
Uh-oh.	That usually works, but not today.
Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous.	Uh-oh.
Conversation, conversation... you look great.	Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous.
And uh, how was your day?	Conversation, conversation... you look great.
"You can't spell ""lousy"" without ""us."""	Lousy.
Marge, wait!	I'm going to take a cab.
Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.	Marge, wait!
Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.	I'm not going to sleep!
Oh my God! A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. What do I do?! What do I do?!	Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.
I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!	For a man confronted with danger, two responses immediately come to mind.
Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?	I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!
Fleeing didn't work. I have no choice. I will have to... do whatever the other thing was!!!	Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
I'm fightin' for ya, babe. Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. And to show you how serious I am...	What are you doing home from work?
From the place beside the gas station!	From the gas station?
Marge was so happy when I made those promises. What changed?	"No! I'm tired of your broken promises! ""Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds."" ""Sweetie, I'll be home at eight p.m."" ""Sweetie, I'll be home at eight a.m."" ""I'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life."" I'm done!"
How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me! No, that ship has sailed.	Meanwhile, Homer was doing something very difficult for him -- thinking.
Hm. Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?	Fortunately, the modern man has a third alternative.
I think it would!	Hm. Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?
Searchy? Where can I find brake fluid?	I think it would!
That was yesterday.	There are... fourteen... taco Joes in your area.
Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?	"""Yesterday"" by John Lennon and Paul McCartney."
I can't please any woman.	Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?
Okay, let's see how straight it is.	Bart! Milhouse!
What have I told you about comical entrances?	Guess who's coming to dinner!
I'm planing down that door that always sticks. I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline.	Homie, what are you doing?
Yes, my love?	Homer...
Oh. Well, you know how in the Special Olympics they give medals just for showing up?	This list is from six years ago.
I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make.	What fish may I deplete from our oceans for your passing pleasure? Perhaps some shark fin soup? Whale tonsils? Baby dolphin blowhole? Turtle smile?
You're all I have left. I trust you completely.	You want omakase: chef's choice.
Okay... this should do it.	And I you. Let me run your credit card to celebrate that trust.
Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.	I see tears in your toro.
Omakase? Where have I heard that word before?	I say marriage is like fish. There are parts so delicious they could've been sliced from angels...and parts we make into omakase.
Well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy.	I'm not hungry. Goodnight.
"Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"	I'm down to two a day, but I've been dead for ten years.
Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!	"Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that. I've been readin' that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give 'em what-for in the bedroom there."
Hello dere!	"""Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms and kissed him deeply, then said: 'now if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin' hole'."" I can't be the only one who likes this."
The minister's wife? What are you here for?	Hello dere!
I think I could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. Bob's your uncle.	Well, are you comfortable with role play?
Oh Marge! Come to the ga-rage! You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!	Mmm... new cushion smell!
Just relax. Sit down. Not in that chair! It has no bottom!	What does this do?
Anger's a mood!	This is not putting me in the mood!
I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...	Why would you think I'd like this?
Quick! Call the Procter and Gamble help line!	I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
What does that mean?	Huh. That was just a placebo.
It's behind the Dingle Swing.	Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine.
So, you forgive me?	Ohhh.
Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?	Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. And there's nothing a woman loves more than that.
Which one?	Actually I'm cool with one of them.
What size batteries.	Not gonna say.
Ooh! How many?	D.
Holy moly!	Sixteen.
Really? You wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?	It sure has taken a beating over the years. Might be time to get a new one...
No need. I already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.	"Are there any two words more exciting than ""couch shopping?"""
And you know, Marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends.	No need. I already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.
They charged a deposit!	But they let me take fabric samples!
That's right, sweetie. It always comes from corporate.	They had to! It came from corporate!
Ew! Just hearing about them makes me itch.	The latest New York fashion has come to Springfield -- bedbugs!
Funny how the brain does that, huh?	Ew! Just hearing about them makes me itch.
The brain is so stupid.	It's making me see them!
Probably one of Bart's dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?	How did we get bedbugs?
Touché.	D'unno. Why are your friends such drunks?
Wait a minute! This has oats in it!	I don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!
Ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!	Wait a minute! This has oats in it!
Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't.	Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses.
"And if it's such a ""Good Book,"" how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he'll flack anything!"	Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't.
"Seriously, ""Pews?"""	"And if it's such a ""Good Book,"" how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he'll flack anything!"
Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?	Homer, I love your passion. It's terrific, it's really something. Listen -- I'm just thinking -- would you consider being my deacon?
Oh, now we're talkin'. But why me?	No, not at all. It's like a sexton, or a rector.
"Well I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, ""I'm your astronaut""!"	Because if I can get the man who sleeps through church to be my guy, this town will know that religion can be fun.
Just looking for the bathroom.	Homer! You're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding!
But this paper towel feels so good.	This is not the bathroom!
That would save us several hundred bucks.	Homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married.
Right, um, I don't understand, Lisa, we let you get up early to watch the Royal Wedding!	Tell her she's wrong!
Since when?	Hey, I have a weakness for pomp!
It's an honor, sir.	Uh, but first, let me introduce our new deacon... Homer Simpson!
Lost sheep! Yes! Sis boom bah!	You bring in the lost sheep and the others will follow.
Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. The answer may shock you.	Walking to car... stepped in hole... twisted ankle... tremendous pain... keep it elevated...
Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself.	Dad?! You always hated church!
Why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only God can do that...	The only thing bigger than you, is you tomorrow.
Someone finally took one!	Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Church--
DAY BY DAY... DAY BY DAY... THE DEACON'S JOB... IS PRETTY OKAY... PRETTY OKAAAY... I'M GOING TO BE A DEACON... DAY BY DAY... I'M ALREADY A DEACON... DAY BY DAY...	We can have the reception at Wong Lee's!
Son, I'd love to, but... I'm a deacon now. My butt's place is in my pants.	We need guidance!
What the--?	We've lost him.
Calm yourselves! In times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... Reverend Hooper.	I have a plan -- save your civic leaders!
His boringness saved us all...	His words have soothed the amphibious beasts!
Oh boy.	DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY / I'VE GOT THREE KIDS / AND TWO ARE OKAY / TWO ARE OKAY! / ONE OF THEM IS THE BABY / THE SMART ONE IS MINE MAYBE / I HOPE THE BOY GETS RABIES / DAY BY DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY... / OH I PRAY / DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAAAY!
Is that the radon detector?	Oh boy.
Marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine Oscar Red Carpet! There were some awesome dresses! And quite a few dis-as-ters.	Mom's deleting old TV shows off the DVR.
"Well, I can't part with a single one of my ""Hoarders""! Hands off my episodes of ""Episodes,"" and if you delete ""Revenge""..."	Fine. What would you get rid of?
...so I stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.	It's not what you think!
Nothin's gonna delete these!	...so I stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.
I know C.P.R.	...and that's why libraries use newspaper rods.
I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.	I know C.P.R.
HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE... HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...	I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.
Too on the nose. I REALLY NEED TO LEARN / 'CAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FOOLS...	"Are you sure it wasn't ""Stayin' Alive?"""
Now wait a minute. Gotta make sure you're okay. Who's the president now?	I BELIEVE IN YOUSE... you guys, you saved me! You do care!
He's back!	Some jerk.
The woman I love!	Homer Simpson!
Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident.	I sent you to the store to get applesauce for Maggie two hours ago!
Okay, Moe, one more surprise.	Thatta boy.
They're like a wedding ring, I can't take them off anymore.	Yes. 'Cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. Like the one pair of blue pants I bought Homer twenty years ago.
Got anything for a man my size?	No, it's a forty-four long -- I wear a thirty-eight hunched.
Tent, eh?	Absolutely not. Tent City is across the street.
No tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. Thank you, fashion police.	No husband of mine is wearing a tent!
Thank God I'm not in the shower!	Now what say we turn the hot water on and off while your father's taking a shower.
The crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.	So you're saying Moe's Dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?
Stupid clog...	Mother!!!
My head hairs! I'm bald!	Stupid clog...
Get-- Get get in there...	My head hairs! I'm bald!
Woo hoo!	Get-- Get get in there...
Is it that obvious?	Ah, Mr. Homer. I see you are wearing the bald man's beret.
My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.	I'm as smooth as jazz.
Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe.	What the? But I used the best label paste.
Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it.	Hey, come on, there's sexy bald like... uh... Babar, king of the elephants. I read his books as a kid. He married his cousin, Celeste. That was my takeaway.
Sausage fingers!	Your tongue is nimble, unlike sausage fingers.
Okay guys, here's the deal -- I've gone bald.	Hey, your baseball cap's one plastic bump tighter than usual. What gives?
What are you talking about?	Yeah, you already landed a hot wife. That's the only reason men evolved hair.
The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not.	You lured Marge in with your hair. You trapped her with marriage. You skinned and field-gutted her by having kids. Now she's mounted on your wall for good, with fake glass eyes and a rubber tongue.
It's not even noon.	You sound seriously depressed. Why don't we talk about it over at Moe's?
Who are you?	I couldn't help overhearing your predicament. Mainly because my hearing is so great.
Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay.	"You'll need your voice to say ""thanks, Mom"" after your next recital!"
You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.	No, just a regular hairless Joe like you. Been bald since I was twenty-three. With the money I've saved I bought a yacht.
Wow, is that what your wife did?	You wait for the right moment, you show her that glorious dome, and then you rest it sweetly on her bosom and let the kisses flow like rain.
Which one?	Thank you!
Yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true.	Listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you.
Marge, I have something to show you.	Oh boy! There's crumbs on it!
No, it's something else.	Is it your impression of Mr. Burns eating soup? Because I'm not in the mood.
Well?	No, it's something else.
Hair, no hair, I don't really think about it.	I always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon!
Tell me about it.	Confidence is so attractive in a man.
Oh Marge, when you hold me like that...	Tell me about it.
To me it's legs versus boobs.	We take you now to doubles action between Pavlyuchenkeka-Vilnikova and Strakova-Mishtnupetrateva.
What the--? Change the channel? But I'm watching soft-core tennis!	To me it's legs versus boobs.
What the hell is that?	Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!
Did she really say that?	Mom said we could watch it!
No.	Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?
"You like this now? What about ""Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?"""	Ki-Ya!
Guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery.	If you understood probability, you would never play the lottery.
Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.	So you didn't buy our weekly ticket?
Four lucky numbers for four best friends.	Hey, it's time. Turn it on! Turn it on!
And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why.	My number's twenty-two. No reason. Just twenty-two.
I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!	Guys, guys, we gotta celebrate! Throw a ragin' party! I'll cash the ticket, Homer, Homer, you get the food--
To the best feeling in the world -- money.	Who cares? We got the money! I'm so happy! I'm so happy!
Guys, I got big plans for these winnings. I'm going to build... a swimming pool.	To the best feeling in the world -- money.
So freaking far in the ground, baby.	Guys, I got big plans for these winnings. I'm going to build... a swimming pool.
Yeah, that's probably what happened.	I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.
I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.	I wonder what's keeping Carl?
I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.	I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.
The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl.	Good old Carl's phone went straight to voicemail. Again.
Our money's gone.	Carl's gone.
Guys, I think we might need a new song. FOUR BEST FRIENDS WHO NE-VER QUAR-REL	We've been betrayed -- by good ol' Carl!
I don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...	Guys, give Carl a chance! I'm sure he's gonna come back!
"Hey, what's this? ""I've gone home. Goodbye forever, Carl Carlson."""	"I bet he flew to Quebec to bring us back authentic French Canadian sugar pie. Oh, I can taste it already. ""Mmm, thanks for the sugar pie, Carl."""
I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over.	I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings. I thought it would have been you, or you, or you.
Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff.	You don't know where Carl is from?
Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!	Hey, hey, get that outta here! I don't ever want to see that moolah-stealing jackpot-thief again!
I just need to get closer.	Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!
He's looking at a geyser! And there's a sign in front of it!	I just need to get closer.
It's too small to read.	He's looking at a geyser! And there's a sign in front of it!
I thought it was Superman's Superman-cave.	Ice-land? Is that even a real place?
Fifty bucks per bag? I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.	Well if that's Carl's home, then that's where our money is! And that's where we're going! We gotta pack!
Baby... I'm going for us. That money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.	You're going so far away. I'll miss you.
I've already taken care of that.	How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
This is funny, it says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy. The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody.	Hey Lenny, when are you gonna wise up? Carl never wants to see us again! I'm done talkin' to you!
Just say he's black, Moe.	Excuse me, uh, we're looking for our, friend... he's, uh, about so tall, uh, wears a jacket, he's, um, got no visible tattoos...
How do you know about Carl's family?	Carl Carlson! His family has been hated for a thousand years.
All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two...	Apparently screwing over your friends is in Carl's blood -- his adopted blood.
Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters.	All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two...
The gates are locked.	"Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants say ""Hjorleifsstræti"" across the butt."
Aw, dammit, we lost him!	It's Carl! Wake up, wake up!
It's no use. We're perfectly matched.	Aw, dammit, we lost him!
We did it!	It's no use. We're perfectly matched.
Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine.	We did it!
Sorry, Lenny.	Not to me.
What the hell is this?	Hey, hey, hey, Lenny, forget him, forget him! Look, we still got the money.
Sorry, Carl. It's World War II all over again -- America kicks Iceland's ass.	Maybe we'd give it back to our friend, but we're not friends, remember?
Guys, do you think Carl was right? What if we're not real friends? Maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff...	Nooo!
Put the noodles in the shed. There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.	Hi, Homie! Did you get the money? The kids have been stocking up on pool noodles!
Well, we won't know that till after.	I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?
But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic?	Just read the saga and see what it says.
Yes!	Thorn?
Forvitinn.	Yes!
You can't not do it!	I can't do this! I CAN'T DO THIS!
Okay, let's see what this thing says.	You can't not do it!
"""When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready""..."	Okay, let's see what this thing says.
"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders."	Wow, Carl's family really was brave!
"The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""	"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders."
Carl's family was even worse than people thought.	"The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""
Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.	Hey guys... I think I feel bad for Carl.
I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister.	Yes.
You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn.	I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister.
But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson...	You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn.
It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.	The blood of a thousand tiny horses is on their hands!
Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much.	Carl Carlson is our friend. Even if he doesn't believe it.
We don't get together to share our emotions. We get together to escape them.	Guys, thanks for teaching me the true meaning of male friendship: the stuff that comes from in here... that is guy stuff.
Okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new...	To nothing!
...keg-pools!	What is it? What is it? What is it?
And we're more in love than ever. In your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year!	Our first anniversary.
You have a great day, ma'am.	Better clean that off.
He's not your daddy.	Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp.
I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.	Fat daddy smell like beer!
But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven -- the fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three!	I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here.	Homer, you're the anchor store of my heart!
Yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. And I promise each anniversary will be better and better...	Oh Homie, what a wonderful anniversary!
But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.	Sometimes you have to say to hell with rules.
Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that...	Wait... you named me after a train?
Why are you taking away the train?	Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that...
Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!	Memory loss! Could be a brain tumor! Take this and go see Fantasia!
She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.	Are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!	Try this.
Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night.	So I'm not babysitting tomorrow night?
Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?	Dad! Do we have to ride like this?
There's no such place!	Hey Lardo! Where're you goin' in your Lardo car? Lardville?
Uh... anniversary? That comin' up?	Hi, Homie! A crazy thing happened when I was ordering your anniversary gift.
"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"	Yes. And it's a big one. Remember?
The surprise is safe! The expression on her face will be priceless!	"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
Currently: zero.	He forgot our anniversary again? He remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.
Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back.	I know what it's like not to be listened to. Please ignore every sensible instinct you have and continue this conversation. And by the way, this is my real voice.
Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?	Homie, I bet you're wondering why I stayed on the computer until four a.m.
Um, Marge, I have to go.	What? Where're your going? I--
All worth it for Marge!	What the heck am I saying? Homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered.
I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...	Well, we could... live blog it.
Because it's in the public domain?	Why are you singing that?
Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!	Hello! It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.
All right, all right, I'll be right there!	Then keep quiet like a cabbage!
Boy, oh boy!	That's great. I wonder what surprise your father has in store.
Marge, I threw my back out. Can you please refill this prescription right away?	Boy, oh boy!
It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.	Where's it from?
"And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""	That'll take hours! On our anniversary!
It's working. She's gone! All right, everyone, magically appear!	"And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""
Wow, Moe. Great shrub costume.	It's working. She's gone! All right, everyone, magically appear!
You guys are the best. I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you.	Yeah. I sell 'em on the internet for like-minded people. Now let's lay some track.
You think we'll last twenty-five years?	What a wonderful anniversary.
Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!	So, you're the kind of man-eater Hall and Oates warned us all about.
Costume drama or naughty comedy?	Your wife and my husband have been watching British TV together.
You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants.	Drama! Drama!
"My only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never	 I often go online to see how Lindsay Wagner's looking now - fabulous	 and I once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. But it's no secret how much I love my Margie."	Ben, Ramona, I wanna tell you something I've learned over ten years of marriage. The secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train.
Honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?	That exists? Oh boy.
Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear.	Well, I was trying to buy you snack cakes...
How did we get here?	Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear.
BUT WHEN MARGE WENT BOO HOO / I WAS BUILDING A CHOO-CHOO...	MARGE WAS FEELING LONELY AND BORED / EVERY NIGHT SHE WAS IGNORED
YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET...	FIND LOVE ON THE NET
Okay. I'm ready for the Nuclear Workers Convention! It's a little sad. The guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick.	"Yes it is, they're my lines as the scarecrow in ""The Wizard of Oz."""
Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii.	Did you pack everything you need?
Ooh, my lava's almost cooled!	Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii.
A whole weekend away from my family. I can't believe I have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. Send me a picture?	Take that! In your face, boy! Ow, ow! / Hey! You stupid...
Now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag.	Yeah, they're the perfect combination of work, and binge drinking.
SWAG! I'M GONNA GRAB FOREVER / STUFF THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED / SWAG!	Now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag.
I'M GONNA HAVE FORTY KEY CHAINS! / AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE FORTY KEYS! / SWAG!	SWAG! I'M GONNA GRAB FOREVER / STUFF THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED / SWAG!
MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF...	Interested in learning a procedure that could save your life?
MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF...	Um, all I have are these spec sheets.
I still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!	The wild man of Wichita!
I'll kill you, you son of a--	He wasn't dead till you rolled over on him!
Hello, everyone.	Gibberish!
I overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight.	Homie! What happened to you?
All the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. I had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.	Why didn't you call us?
Yes, back to normal.	Well... I guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.
"They're called ""Superoos,"" son. With pictures of the cast of ""The Expendables""."	Yeah, it's tough being man of the house. You left some big underpants to fill. I didn't know they made Underoos in size fifty-two.
That kind of small scale violence solves nothing.	Why didn't you strangle me?
Uh, I'll pass on the pork.	Couldn't agree more! Now, to celebrate... ta-da! Pork chops crusted with Cheeto dust!
A napkin.	Dad, what's that on your lap?!
Can I just get a glass of water?	Glad you're back, buddy. You've got a lot of catching up to do.
Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed.	I've been having snuggle dreams!
You're so beautiful when I cut you off in the middle of a question.	Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed.
Moving my body.	Oh my, what's that thing you're doing?
How y'all doin'?	Something happened to Dad on that trip. This is worse than when he went to New Orleans and came back with the southern accent.
Hanging up the receiver, eh?	I haven't heard anything about you, except from you.
How much did you say?	How much did you hear?
So I heard half of nothing.	Nothing really.
Lisa. I'll miss you when this is all over.	Dad, you're scary when you're calm and focused.
This conversation.	When what's all over?!
Of the house. Where the fireplace is. We're toasting marshmallows. Marshmallows.	What other side?
Okay.	Don't talk.
What was the first one again?	I can torture you, I can give you incredible sex, or you can just tell me what I want to know.
Hey, I'm the one in bed with two beautiful women.	I see, you're stupid.
In a breaking and entering kind of way.	You think I'm beautiful?
No one.	Who are you talking to?
HEERE'S THE CLIMAX	I love my job.
WHAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN BUILDING TOOOO /	HEERE'S THE CLIMAX
HOPE IT PAYS OFF FOR YOUUU...	WHAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN BUILDING TOOOO /
Weird thing under a tarp.	Whatcha got there, Homer?
You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.	Don't forget me!
I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.	Please, don't do this, Dad! I don't know what horrors you saw in Boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love.
Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa.	Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass.	Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa.
They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!	I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass.
And they also gave me an alcohol detox.	They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!
I've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!	And they also gave me an alcohol detox.
Lisa, I've never prayed to a city in my life, and if I did, it would be Hershey, Pennsylvania. I was kneeling on the Affirmation Rug they gave me.	But I saw you praying to Mecca!
See?	Lisa, I've never prayed to a city in my life, and if I did, it would be Hershey, Pennsylvania. I was kneeling on the Affirmation Rug they gave me.
Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees.	See?
Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air.	IF HE COMES A-CALLIN' YOU'D BETTER HIDE...
Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in.	I've told you that a million times!
Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken.	Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in.
Both sold to me by Apu this morning.	Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken.
When I release it into the A. C. system, it'll stink up the plant forever.	Both sold to me by Apu this morning.
Just like when I smell up the toilet.	No one can use it but no one gets hurt!
Hey, hey, it's not what you think, Lou. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!	There he is! Use your fattest handcuffs!
We sure did.	We did it, Dad. We did it.
No, I was just up late watching a movie. Something with... William Holden and--	You weren't shot!
A beer from the sky! It's a sign!	You know, Dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking...
Shut up.	I am the Borax! I speak for the woods! But I've plastered my likeness on consumer goods!
Why you little... I'll teach you to make medical history!	Aw geez. Strangle me out of this, Fatso.
Oops.	Why you little... I'll teach you to make medical history!
All good.	Oops.
Man cave! Everyone's welcome to my man cave!	Hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, I finally get my man cave.
"Great... oh, and I have this ""two heads for one"" coupon."	I think we've made some progress here.
How 'bout this one?	Well, that's for lettuce.
One random disorder free with every schizophrenia.	How 'bout this one?
Ooh, mix-ins!	Lis, I'm gonna make sure you stay asleep.
Son-of-a!	Ooh, mix-ins!
THIS IS THE SONG THAT YOU HEAR AT THE CIRCUS / SUNG BY A GUY THAT YOU SEE AT THE CIRCUS...	Disbelieve, as the Strong Man pulls a wagon with his bare tongue!
Marge! Get away from those freaks! You belong to me! The dumb, hairless brute!	Mr. Burnsum! You should treat these poor people with respect!
Taste the strength of your fiancé!	Well, you are the best this circus has to offer...
Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus.	With the mighty tongue God's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?
With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?	My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.
I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her, and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!	With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?
You're gonna be sorry you said that.	You're gonna be sorry you said that.
Hey Marge, you wanna marry Moe?	I just lost my keys! What do you know, I am gathering moss!
The poor lonely fellow is about to die.	I'm engaged to you, my love.
Let me worry about how. But you know, you could make his last day a happy one. And the ring is just the icing on the cake.	Really? How?
The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.	What ring?
But won't you be jealous, my love?	The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.
Dear, I am not the jealous type. And from you, I have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos.	But won't you be jealous, my love?
Ho ho ho! A very small time!	Moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful.
Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. Now, the toast...	Ho ho ho! A very small time!
To you, Marge. Now you are one of us.	Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. Now, the toast...
One of us! Gooble goo!	To you, Marge. Now you are one of us.
Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?	What are you doing?
Strong man, Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. Leave my trailer forever!	Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?
You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties.	Strong man, Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. Leave my trailer forever!
What the hell does gooble goo mean?	One of us! Gooble goo! One of us! Gooble goo!
"You killed Burnsum? Now who is gonna say ""Step right up""?"	We don't know! Gooble goo! We don't know! Gooble goo!
This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!	One of us! One of us!
...and that, kids, is how I met your mother.	This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!
People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.	Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.

Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever.	YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY!
Overstay my welcome for forty years?	Well, for some reason it relaxes me. Now do that thing Gene Simmons does.
I'm thinking about it!	We'll have more regrets at eleven tonight following an all-new bottle of scotch.
That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.	I'm thinking about it!
Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future.	That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.
You cost me a piece of all of that!	Now, let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones...
Aw, don't cry.	You cost me a piece of all of that!
I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.	If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold.
You misheard that on purpose!	Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up thirty-five hundred percent!
"Um... it says I should give you ""lumbar support."" Better go to the lumberyard..."	Must find way... to blame myself.
Hey book, are you expecting this?	"Anything from ""Love Gun""!"
And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!	Hey book, are you expecting this?
That is a good fire.	And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
We've had some good times.	Now you try.
And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.	We've had some good times.
What the?	And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.
I think I just might have what you're looking for.	Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down to make a statue of Joe Paterno, which we changed to look like Eugene Levy.
Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.	I think I just might have what you're looking for.
Why does everyone know?!	Apple closed up another twenty points today.
My boy's okay!	Homer's rising faster than Apple stock!
And together we are.	You know what I think about regrets? As long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one.
"I'll handle this. ""Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid."" And send."	Feels like this play date's gone on forever.
What the?! If this kid's Dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.	I think I'm gonna throw up the mac and cheese you fed me. I'm not supposed to have it. That's why I had so much.
Once again, cats have it better.	You Only Live Once.
Look at me, I'm afraid of dying!	I'm sorry, but does Kirk know how silly he looks?
NO DREAM WILL COME TRUE,	AND EVERY NIGHT / THE ENDING'S THE SAME
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.	NO DREAM WILL COME TRUE,
I'm tired of livin' once.	Pure poison.
Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past.	I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to regret saying Yolo.
My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.	Postage, marked in pesetas? Who are those letters from?
Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future...	My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.
I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain. Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.	Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future...
So sad.	I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain. Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.
If you're my wife's secret lover, come in. There's nothing I can do for her anymore.	I did it! I saved the day! The same way I won that battle in Vietnam! By fainting!
Eduardo?! Is it really you? why are you here?	"I am looking for my amigo de la pluma, or ""pen pal."""
I'm Homer Simpson!	To save the soul of Homer Simpson. Now where is he, old man?
I wish.	Did your hair burn off in a fire that trapped you in a candy factory?
What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do.	Buenos dias, Eduardo. Can you write back and tell me what that means?
Yeah, well listen, pal. I have my treasure: my wife and my children.	And I, my friend, have been doing them!
Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?	I've had eight wives... and two hundred children! Among them artists, doctors and revolutionary chefs.
Did you just fart, sir.	Hey, Homer. Did you just fart?
Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.	Easy, easy, Homer, I want to help you fulfill some of your childhood dreams.
Why are you doing this? Wait. Are you in love with me?	Now, this book of your childhood drawings will come to life.
Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!	In love with the concept of you, yes.
One more ride?	Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!
I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great.	The answer, sadly, is not yes.
That doesn't sound happy.	If you're happy I'm happy.
Mmm, melon collie.	I feel kind of... melancholy...
Well, what was your childhood dream?	That's not helping.
Let's do it.	Jumping on the bed. But I never disobeyed my parents, till I married you.
We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!	I'm a little tired. Could we just snuggle again?
Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.	That sounds salty but you seem sweet. I'm gonna call you kettle corn!
So that's it? All my dreams, lived?	Here.
Well, we've gotta do it! I never leave a job unfinished. It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook. So much infighting. I had to get outta there!	Eh... all but one.
The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.	All right, Homer, we shall do this thing.
Um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray. A true legend in the voiceover community. I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence.	Just step out that door and you can glide to earth like your boyhood hero: Rocky the Flying Squirrel.
Okay.	You don't have to flap. Just glide on the wind.
I'm doing it! I'm flying like the squirrel I always knew I was.	Because then I'd be the one thing I swore I wouldn't: you.
Ooh, indigo!	I'm doing it! I'm flying like the squirrel I always knew I was.
Majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness.	You can listen to your wife when you are dead. Savor the moment.
So beautiful.	Majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness.
Aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half.	So beautiful.
Stupid tallest building in Springfield!	Aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half.
Son, it was so beautiful! I went faster than the speed of sound.	Good luck with that. The only thing that'll change my mind is a sign from God.
No matter what, Homer Simpson has done it. And soon I hope I remember who Homer Simpson is and his relationship to me. But I have no regrets. In fact, all this has given me a sense of calm I've never had before.	My friend, you've lived your dreams.
Can you give me the morphine forever?	That's the morphine.
Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!	No way! A person on morphine all the time would constantly dissolve in inappropriate laughter.
Oh. It was all just a dream.	Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!
Oh yeah. Great. Um... Do I drop you at the curb or do I have to park and walk you in?	It was not just a dream and you said you'd drive me to the airport.
No time for breakfast, Marge. Just give me a banana.	American football.
Now, listen... I have to work late tonight.	No time for breakfast, Marge. Just give me a banana.
It's a tough economy. Money doesn't grow on trees.	Again? I was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.
It grows on threes!	It's a tough economy. Money doesn't grow on trees.
Nice sunglasses, Lenny.	You've got the touch tonight, Homer.
I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money.	What? What are you lookin' at?
Who's president now, Alexander Hamilton?	I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money.
Timing the elevators, eh? Smart.	Two minutes apart.
Okay, okay, no worries.	No, no. I'm timing my contractions. I think I'm in labor. Deep in labor.
What the?	Okay, okay, no worries.
Everyone has a cellphone. Mine's at home.	Do you have a cellphone?
"Everything will be fine... um... Oh you, uh, you like movies? This reminds me of that scene in ""Alien."""	The most beautiful moment of my life is happening NOW!
The scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.	What?!
Oh, he was just here.	Aw, that's sweet. Listen... I'm glad I'm not going through this alone. I haven't seen my boyfriend in months.
You like lies? Here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...	No he wasn't. But thanks for lying.
Okay Homer, remember your Lamaze training...	I think the baby's coming!
Yeah, wow, that does feel good. Oh no, I think it's coming. I haven't even picked a name yet!	Now, this next position is fantastic for women who are carrying especially big. Homer, can you demonstrate?
No, I didn't!	You did this to me!
Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--	I'm talking to the baby. Here it comes!
Oh! Oh wait, there's more!	What?
For unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in August 2009, a baby.	It's a dude! And he's uncut! Very Euro! Now, hug your mommy.
Yeah, that guy didn't even look over once.	Well, it was nice to share this moment with someone who cared.
Miraculous.	How was work?
Good game, everyone. I never dreamed a night where you'd discovered I was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note.	After you wear that, you need to be hosed down for bedbugs.
Hey, Gretchen!	Homer!
Good as new. And thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. It may be a little stretched out.	I had your jacket cleaned!
Wow. So now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m.	So... you wanna hold little Homer?
Aw, that's sweet.	Wow. So now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m.
Um, hey... I was just driving by... with some baby stuff we didn't need and uh...here's some diapers Maggie's too big for, an incredible educational toy I forgot to give Bart...	I thought we were playing cards.
Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight...	Thanks. Hey... could you babysit for an hour? I've been alone with the baby for days.
I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.	Full house?! You win again.
Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju?!	I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
Where's Hoju? Where's Hojuuu?!	Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju?!
Kids blow up so fast.	Where's Hoju? Where's Hojuuu?!
Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Junior, a baby I delivered in an elevator the night I pretended to go to work but was really playing poker!	Homie? Aw, you're shopping ahead for Maggie.
Oh, yes, I am shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent.	What?!
Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog...	Why are you saying that?
Um, November.	First few weeks of what?
Excuse me.	And some of the angles are loooooow. But don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions.
Oh baby!	If he's not in there, where is he?
Oh baby, shake it! Homer like!	Oh baby!
Tell me what a cow says!	Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you.
Marge, it's not what you think!	So this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.
Oh, it's cool. We did it in an elevator.	You have a baby together?
But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good.	I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.
I haven't had a drink for a week.	It's not good! None of it's good!
It's true. Even the other guy in the elevator. He's right here.	...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
Goodbye, Homer Junior. I guess you're the man of the house now. And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth.	Well I'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. I thought that was strange poop on your collar.
Exactly. You always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.	You know what? I think it's fine if Homer spends a few hours now and then with... Homer Junior.
And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:	It's true, I never specified the home.
SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!	And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
Oh man, I really overdid it tonight.	SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!
"No. I'm exhausted from ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. Knees and toes."" It's the ""toes"" that get ya, Marge. It's the toes..."	Late night at Moe's eh?
Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow.	What about your own children?
Yes. We'll be back by three. Homer has a very tight nap schedule.	Three.
I was talking about myself in the third person.	Quit talking about that baby!
I wanted you all to be happy together, so I brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony.	What do you think I'm taking their raise out of?
Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family.	Okay guys, I got your ice creams.
Why you little... I'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! C'mere, you!	Are you nuts? You can't even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble.
Can I just say goodbye to him quick?	"Dad! We're missing ""The Giant Capybaras of Uruguay!"""
Okay, I know what'll cheer you kids up. Seeing me out-monkey the monkeys.	Can I just say goodbye to him quick?
Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!	If they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again!
Stupid monkeys.	Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!
I'm sorry, Homer Junior. You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill.	This is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!
Okay, I've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. The sky is blue, but no one really knows why. Don't believe what they tell you. Girls are great and terrible at the same time. Get used to it. And, most importantly-- Oops, we're here. You'll have to figure it out on your own.	Me too.
Sorry, little fella. One day I'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away.	Okay, I've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. The sky is blue, but no one really knows why. Don't believe what they tell you. Girls are great and terrible at the same time. Get used to it. And, most importantly-- Oops, we're here. You'll have to figure it out on your own.
Woo hoo! Who's Chase?	Homer, great news! Chase came back!
You didn't tell me he was a soldier.	Oh my God, is that my son?
Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes.	I didn't want you to marry me because I was pregnant. I wanted you to marry me because I was nagging you.
But n-n-n-nurture...	Dude, he's my kid. He likes what I like.
I guess this is it, little guy.	He does, baby, he does!
The most beautiful words a father can hear.	Da-da.
Oh.	Da-da! Da-da!
I do.	Hey, one day you'll have kids of your own.
Hi Maggie, if you could talk, I know you'd have a few choice words for me.	He shouldn't have bet his door if he didn't wanna lose it.
You want me to take care of your dolly?	Hi Maggie, if you could talk, I know you'd have a few choice words for me.
That's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.	You want me to take care of your dolly?
Hey, what's this marching band have to do with Homer Junior? What? There were cheerleaders in our house? And nobody told me?	This is what we're fightin' for, babe.
Y'ello! Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel.	Ooh, spaghetti.
All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!	So... you were going through a phase?
Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle.	All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!
Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.	No! You never let me be Mike Singletary!
MY NAME IS HOMER / I'M A REAL FULL BACK / GONNA RUN THAT BALL / DON'T WANT NO FLACK...	Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
Why you little--	IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOU'LL GET A HEART ATTACK...
You used to be fun.	CGI also convenes CGI America, a meeting devoted to economic recovery and job creation...
That's our girl.	First question: Ms. Simpson, what would you do to get America out of Afghanistan?
What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.	Ice cream sandwiches. Why?
What your mother is trying to say is--	Well, that's sort of what I was trying to say. But...
Get real, ding dong! You've already done so much bad stuff, Skinner's never going to let you on that boat.	Yes.
Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's.	Thanks, Mom. I'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is.
What the?	To avoid temptation, I'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. I buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard.
Come on.	That's not where I buried them.
Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened...	And it's all thanks to you, kid. To show my appreciation I'm gonna bring you with me next time I entertain the troops. Warning, they're not American troops.
Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway.	Skinner didn't let me go.
As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner.	I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed. Is there anything you can do?
Yes. What's Skinner's weakness?	You'll really help me get revenge?
Good. We can use that.	Everything.
Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds?	I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back.
Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently.	Still, I can't be sure I killed her.
Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see.	Not compared to this.
"Just call me ""The Cleaner."""	Now do you want to dispose of this jelly-soaked pillow?
The deed is done.	She's in a better place.
Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head?	I wish you'd asked me before you...
Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in.	No! No! God no!
Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors.	If this were a movie mother wouldn't let me watch it.
Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes.	I don't want to sound ungrateful, but could I eat one of the potatoes?
Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that.	Thanks for stickin' up for me.
Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday?	Sure, Dad.
Dick Fiddler!	Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday?
You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful.	"Seymour, when this fat guy and his kid asked me to fake my death to punish you, I said, ""Sure, that's something to do."""
Marge, to that I say boo, humbug.	Homer, you have to take the Halloween decorations down before you put the Christmas ones up.
Global Warming, huh? By pure coincidence, every scientist was right!	"Meteorologists warn there'll be no snow this Christmas anywhere in America. Not even in Alaska, where the Eskimos now have a hundred words for ""nothing."""
I don't have to pick up the dog poops!	Oh, you know what this means, kids?
Oh good. Marge remarried after I died. Wait a minute, I'm not dead. What's goin' on?	Right, right. But we're not. Please, please take our money and everybody wins.
Uh-uh! No way! I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! And maybe that guy. Lincoln-style. But that's it.	These are our new boarders!
Oh, I don't know. It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January.	This is a great thing! We're helping people celebrate Christmas, and we'll be able to afford Christmas!
"What the-- ""The Simpson Bed and Breakfast?"" I always wanted to stay in a place like this!"	Oh, I don't know. It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January.
But Christmas is a special time. And I like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.	"What the-- ""The Simpson Bed and Breakfast?"" I always wanted to stay in a place like this!"
Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you. I'm in. A hundred percent!	What would baby Jesus do?
I'm on a break.	Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you. I'm in. A hundred percent!
The secret is don't read the comment cards.	I don't think you're giving them what they were promised, Dad.
I thought they were just gonna watch me.	Where do the people sit?
Ho, ho, ho!	I've opened up my house to you. And all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
The pillow acted as a girdle.	Not now. Take out that pillow and put it in room three.
You got me weed?	Now dad, I'd like to give you your present.
That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes.	Even better! They're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow.
What? I'm saving them from the struggle of life.	Dad, stop!
Vegetables?!	Well, at least you're eating vegetables.
Shut up, Flanders!	Children... perhaps it's time that I explain the true meaning of Christmas.
Come on, I'll drive you to the airport.	Oh right, we're still doing that.
Where are my keys? Oh, right here.	Come on, I'll drive you to the airport.
Oh, boy. Monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend.	Oh, the happy sound of a blender.
Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?	Oh...
Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!	Actually, this one undoes the stuff from the last one, so it's a de-boot.
But what if I want some cooled water?	Yeah, if you haven't seen it, then you gotta leave the water cooler.
They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like.	Yeah, so he wouldn't be tortured by his past, when he was born in the future.
AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!	Sometimes we feel there's nowhere left to turn, much like Radioactive Man, when he had to kill his own antimatter twin
Okay, I've gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me.	And stay out!
If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!	If Bart's going, I'm going!
Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!	We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.
Bye bye, money!	Bye bye, Maggie!
Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free.	Bye bye, money!
More snip, less lip.	For the 3-D show, that'll be seventy-two dollars.
All right, movie, you better be worth it.	Or, for ten dollars more you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision.
The motorcycle dudes are chicks!	All right, movie, you better be worth it.
I wonder what else is chicks?	The motorcycle dudes are chicks!
Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!	"Also available in ""Arctic Slut,"" ""Morning After Melon,"" and ""Elon Musk."""
You're shushing me! This guy's on his cell phone! She's texting! He's sexting! And that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!	Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!
What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!	That's negative, man.
Illegally download it? Is that legal?	Chins up, Homer. You don't need a theater to watch the movie. You just have to illegally download it.
Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--	The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property. In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from Nascar's 2011 Martinsville Cup.
Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?	And play!
Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. Number nine--	I'm under thirty.
Shut up shut up shut up!	I like that he's not good at shooting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff.
Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?	Homer, go to the theater and see the movie.
Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!	All we want is brand new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'! Why doesn't Hollywood get that?
And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!	No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone!
"Welcome to ""Cinema Pirate-diso."" Tonight's movie is ""Life is Funny,"" directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"	And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
I live it, he writes it.	You're the one who hired the Korean taco truck for our private school fundraiser!
Well, what'd you think?	I live it, he writes it.
Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally.	This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?	An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.
"I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""Cosmic Wars Episode Seven""."	"Men, set your guns on ""kill."" We're going after Homer Simpson."
Ooo, mastermind.	I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison suicide of the mastermind of this operation -- Homer Simpson!
One of you turned me in? Who was it?	We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch.
You!	One of you turned me in? Who was it?
Superintendent Chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same Hawaiian shirt to that luau!	You!
Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!	From now on, the only place you'll be watching movies without having to buy a ticket is jail.
Forever!	Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
What are you guys in for?	Forever!
Movie piracy.	Drug trafficking. What about you?
I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!	Homer! What are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.
"Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""Taken"" where the ""Hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""Fast and Furious."""	Bah! Your Hollywood studios are the real thieves -- claiming all their hit movies have lost money. I spit on their bookkeeping!
Consulate.	I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital.	Consulate.
Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.	Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital.
You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!	It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.
Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?	I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.	I never wanted to say funny vows!
All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.	I didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing.
No.	Homer Simpson, you have been found guilty of illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material. Before sentencing, do you have anything to say for yourself?
You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.	Homer, tell them your side of the story. I know I hurt you, but please trust me now. It'll work.
At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.	But where's the love story?
But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.	At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost.	He's hitting all four quadrants!
I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.	And the worst one of all is--
What the hell is all this?!	Surprise!
You're pirating my movie?	It's still got time code on it, but otherwise, it's a clean copy.
The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.	You're pirating my movie?
"Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion""."	But the movie is, it's about you pirating movies.
Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!	Homie...
And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.	Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!
Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you. Don't ask! Do smell!	And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?	Homie, do you really think you should be--
What?	Homer!
And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy.	Would you take me to buy a comic book Tuesday at midnight?
Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you!	You never watched an episode of Jimmy Kimmel in your life!
C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife.	Wrong! Wrong! Wr-- or... is he?
Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.	Oh right, you have a loving wife?
Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back.	Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.
And now to Moe's.	Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back.
Bart! Your comic vendor's here!	It is the perfect time.
I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.	Actually, it is you that I am here to see. I, um, I need your help... in getting ready for a date. The closest thing I have to a father is the Obi-Wan doll in my store. And he comes from a race of celibate knights, so...
Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!	Does anyone tell you that you look like the man on a box of Mr. Sparkle?
Honki da yo?!	In Japan, drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide!
Not garbage, Americana.	But the walls are covered with garbage.
We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone.	Homer, I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?
Not a word.	And getting the termites out of the trees.
You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!	Excuse me, sir, I am looking for my daughter. I thought this was her residence, but all I see is a store full of non-pornographic manga.
I know, Mr. Sparkle.	I am not Kung Fu instructor. I am humble salaryman who could kick your ass. Say, has anyone told you you look like--
I get that a lot too.	I was going to say, like you're going to have a stroke.
Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old.	Now please, where is my daughter?
I didn't tell you about the basement.	So, an obese nerd has stolen my daughter to live in his basement?!
No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?	Homer, we have much in common. We both love our daughters and discipline our sons.
Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?	Snake rice wine.
What's going on here?	The good thing is, soon I'll be a beautiful swan.
Why you slimy little...!?	Dad, Bart's feet are on my half of the shell!
As long as we keep drinking this.	How long am I gonna stay this way?
GLOWING RODS / GLOWING RODS / IT'S MAKING ME / WEAK AND DIZZY...	Yes!
Who told you that?	Rumor has it they're about to give out the company Christmas gifts.
I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.	Look at you, Mr. Connected.
Glasses! Call Lenny!	Finally I'm not a slave to my stupid human eyeballs!
Lenny! It's me, Homer!	I'm getting a call! Answer call! Hello?
Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?	Huh. I always thought it was Simpsen.
I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.	What's so funny?
Look at these jerks.	I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."	I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses.
Woo-hoo!	Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!
"As early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."	"Interesting. When was the term ""shut up"" invented?"
Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford.	Homie, I think the kids are just hungry.
That's it, I'm taking you off.	Accessing soup kitchens...
Reality!	That's it, I'm taking you off.
Okay, let's see what we've got here.	I'm sorry, sir.
Where's my money?	Are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
But the avatar looks just like you!	Where's my money?
Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars.	I'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
Glasses, take me two minutes back in time.	I heard that!
Marge...	Glasses, take me two minutes back in time.
Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me!	Here's your breakfast.
Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?	Well, I'm not happy with you.
Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them.	Yes. Just like I told you.
Hey, everybody!	Simpson, there's gonna be a heart in my hand. Either paper... or yours.
Carl, it's me! I'm here! Really here!	That's strange. I'm hearing a voice, but I'm not seeing a user icon.
Ow!	Hey, Homer! A lot of information about you. Let me just page through it.
Stop!	Ow!
Wait!	Stop!
What! No one can live in a non-augmented reality! I need another pair of glasses!	Wait!
Um, Mr. Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair. One for the beach house. Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses...	Ooo... So many choices, Maggie.
Monitors?!	Um, Mr. Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair. One for the beach house. Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses...
What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!	Monitors?!
This is a violation of our human rights.	What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
Okay, so let's see what we can see!	This is a violation of our human rights.
Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup.	Okay, so let's see what we can see!
...someone's actually working...	Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup.
Maggie?!	...someone's actually working...
Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.	Such a good baby! You deserve some ice cream.
What else is Marge hiding from me?	Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.
Is she having an affair?	Maggie, he's here!
Why isn't she having an affair?	Thanks for asking me to lunch.
Mr. Burns!	Who are you?!
Marge, that's a compact-only space!	I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. I won't disturb you again.
Well, who knew you were such a rebel? Now, let's learn more about my wife's secret life. Secrets which can only be good.	Marge, that's a compact-only space!
Marge is in therapy?	Okay, I guess.
Pale ales. Please.	Well, he's down to two beers in the shower...
Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!	Everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!	Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!
Spied on her with a hidden camera. She thinks I'm selfish, she thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids...	Whoa. She has crossed a line. How did you find out?
I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.	What? That's crazy! Come on, you work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole, and what do you get? Not one lousy superpower!
Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?	"Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you ""bump into"" Midge in the waitin' room, there."
Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?	Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready! Pork chops with my secret seasoning!
Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock.	Wow. Always one step ahead.
"That's ""Fake Name."""	Please fill out these forms, Mr. Fakinami.
"That's ""Alias."" Du-uh."	I'll just call you Elias.
Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.	Dr. Carlock is like my Wednesday reset button.
No need. Everything's fine.	Come on in, Mr. Fakinami.
Well, as long as I'm paying for the time...	I'm sorry. But there are no cancellations within twenty-four hours.
Ow! Where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?	Well, as long as I'm paying for the time...
I don't need to know, Marge. You deserve to have your secrets.	Oh I forgot to tell you, Homie! I bumped into Helen Lovejoy today, and guess what?
Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something I need to tell you. Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so.	It's not a secret. It's a funny story.
Woo-hoo! I tried! Okay.	Oh, I bet my story's more interesting.
Yeah. And?	Okay, so Helen Lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle Bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!
Where's that cake now?	That's it. That was the story.
Who bought it?	It got sold.
Excuse me. I have to make a call.	Dr. Hibbert.
Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged.	Don't take too long!
Wait, something's wrong. That's better.	Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged.
Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well.	Dad? Please? For Sumadi?
All right, son... but you have to pay me back.	Please!
Do you have my money?	Life is good.
Do you have my money?	What?
Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?	How could I?
Where's my money?	Seriously, do you have my money?
Where's... my... mon... ey?	Where's my money?
Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?	Well, there is one fun fact I've been saving for an emergency situation. Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines?
Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge.	Homer, quit badgering the boy.
Quit pressuring me!	I don't have any diamonds.
What? Did you owe me some money?	Here's your money, dad.
Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep.	"Bart's usually first in line for Taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" Is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
Ten minute rule.	Homer!
Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!	Wow. You don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.
I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!	Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!
Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler.	I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap."	Bart Simpson, at your service.
Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!	Why would I want a nap?
But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.	That doesn't sound like you.
It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.	I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I don't think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time.
What's he doing?	It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.
Okay. In your terms, points are like mice.	Well... my Dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.
Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.	You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.
Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that.	Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!	Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that.
At least someone in this family is using them.	He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.
Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler.	Diggs isn't cuckoo!
Because it's his home forever.	Then why is Diggs there?
I'm eating the food of the future. Beep, boop. What is... love? Boop, beep, boop.	Way ahead of you!
Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?	Lisa, I'd like to thank you for mollifying these land apes. We'd like you and your family to visit us at the Monsarno research campus.
Go! Go! Go!	Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?
Real doctor or PhD?	Doctor Sideshow Bob.
Sideshow Bob!	Look at me! I'm Sideshow Bob!
"""Overfed?"" I don't know this word."	Wait! Wait! Won't you visit me again? Let me show you I really am trying to make a better world. Lisa, we can talk Walt Whitman... And Homer, I think you'd enjoy the company of the campus's lazy overfed squirrels.
Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.	This is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.	That was a sexual harassment seminar!
That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.	You already ate all the chocolate bars.
I like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.	That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
Marge, teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President.	Another seminar tomorrow. I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any.
No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given.	Are you saying I'm wasting my time?
Sorry.	Shut your eyes, they're too bright.
Listen, you punks. If you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place.	That means, three days ago... the two of you... made the blob with two backs!
What the--	He's touching her!
Never!	I'll sign the pledge! Just get your fat heaving buttocks out of my head!
How dare you torture my children with Mozart!	NON PIÙ ANDRAI, FARFALLONE AMOROSO...
I call all music Mozart!	Ahh, you know Mozart?
If it's not final, who cares?	Oh, urgent notice.
"My contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!"	This place is unlivable.
"Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""	Like I said, a lotta violations.
You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad.	No kennels!
Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses?	Don't get fat!
Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan.	Homie, Homie, we'll be old someday.
Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me.	Homer, how are we doing with those cots?
I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!	Well... I really think you should watch your temper.
You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--	"""Stupid kid."" Do you really think that's the way we should communicate?"
Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence.	Dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat Grampa?
Oh yeah!	Your Grampa's alive?
Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself.	Please.
I can handle them from now on, Marge.	Oh... I'll see what I can do.
Gentlemen, I've been thinking. My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. Someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old.	I can handle them from now on, Marge.
I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.	What's your point, pound cake?
Oh, when does the exercise start?	Now we'll talk about dead people you never met while we get a little exercise!
Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!	Yeah, we're mall walking.
Uh, okay! Um... I can't.	Now say something pathetic.
All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge.	Well, thanks for the chicken dinner. How did you know I wanted one?
Better turn up the heat.	Don't call me a gal. Makes me feel like I'm your mother.
Young lady, in my day...	Are you wearing sock garters?
You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.	Your day is my day! We're the same age! You're turning into your father!
Falsies.	They're not coming for another twenty-nine years! Did your earlobes get longer?
Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one.	I'd love to, but I'm sure that it's some sort of a holiday for me.
Oh, it is so hard running in sand.	Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one.
No. No. I can't be old yet. I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm fifty-two!	Oh, it is so hard running in sand.
I'm coming at you with all the power of a reverse mortgage!	No. No. I can't be old yet. I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm fifty-two!
Now let's go home, son.	Ow! Ow! No! I've never really been in a fight!
We've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.	Ooh, what's your hurry?
"""Lisa"" ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""..."	I hear smoothin'!
Guinea pig?	"""Lisa"" ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""..."
Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you.	And when they get excited they jump straight up -- it's called popcorning!
Emojis. Now she's gone too far.	Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you.
"Circle ""other."""	"""I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other."
Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done.	"""This includes feeding	 bathing	 cleaning of droppings and barfings	 and, when the time comes, burying or flushing."""
The kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave.	Oh, my God -- I'm getting a guinea pig! Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!
You don't have children, do you?	You're doing the right thing adopting a rescue pig. You know, most of these guys are rejects from the big guinea-pig mills in the Midwest. Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers.
She's gone, honey. She's gone.	Lisa! You've just gotta choose one. Lisa!?
She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!	Okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy.
Fighting Tweakers rule!	I could get two...?
Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.	No, that's a much bigger animal.
Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...	Well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting.
Yeah, these seem great. Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin.	Milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones.
I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?	This could be our new living room painting!
You know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.	I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks.	Oh, it looks great!
You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.	We should have it appraised!
Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus.	You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.
Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!	I expect it to go somewhere between eighty to one hundred thousand dollars.
No, you'll wear it out!	But I want to see it!
Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.	No, you'll wear it out!
Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...	Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...	Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...	Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!	Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep.	Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
This dude gets it.	For ourselves?
I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!	But the Van Houtens are our friends!
Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?	I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!
I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake.	Well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!	How about this... what if we give the Van Houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
Marge, you like kindness, right?	Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti.	Sure.
Homer looks into Marge's eyes.	So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti.
It's kinder never to tell them.	Homer looks into Marge's eyes.
What'll it take to buy your silence?	Okay... I see your point. We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens.
Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together.	What'll it take to buy your silence?
"""I guess."" You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you."	I guess.
We had a deal. And now we've got nothing...	You found out that painting was worth big bucks, and you weren't gonna tell us?!
We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!	Kind!? You call it kind to give us nothing?
That's exactly how it is.	Oh, so that's how it is!
Oh it is.	Oh is it?
Honey, there's something I wanna show you.	See what happens when we get greedy?
I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance.	An ATM receipt?
With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter.	Five figures!
That's the cushion.	I could write a check with... today's date on it.
Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.	Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
"""You have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" Ooo, a support rock!"	"""Give back the painting!"" The whole town's turned against us!"
Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.	You really think we're still doing the right thing?
The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles!	"First lot: ""Untitled Landscape"" by Johan Oldenveldt, from the Collection of Homer J. and Marge B. Simpson. Let's open the bidding at eighty thousand dollars."
Our cushion!	The auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership.
"Excuse me, we're trying to find ""Café Artiste."""	See what your greed has done?
I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.	Thanks for taking me in, man...
What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?	Oh Luann... I'll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again.
So, why does that chick think she owns the painting?	What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?
Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.	Dawn and I went on a vacation to a resort island called Isla Verde. I bought the painting in a café... but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor.
Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find Café Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours.	It was never her painting. That woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes. And I'd go back to that Café Artiste to prove it... but nothing's gonna get me Luann back.
But our cushion...	He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off.
I wish I knew how.	You're not gonna let it go, are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.	This is so exciting! My first time establishing provenance!
That's why she'll believe it.	That's a terrible thing for a father to do.
Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.	Welcome to Café Artiste! Would you like a glass of Strupo? It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island.
And that man sold it to me!	Oh, yes, I remember that painting. And that is the man I sold it to.
That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!	And that man sold it to me!
I love art!	That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
Who?	I painted it! Me, Klaus Ziegler!
Prove it.	This is where I painted your so-called Oldenveldt.
Oh... crap.	Prove it.
Now let's play human foosball!	What!?
What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?	But, you still, I mean... I suppose you're right.
While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?	Well, on that front, perhaps I can be of assistance. If there's one thing art is good for, it's to melt the frost which often hardens a woman's heart.
I'll pay you in Strupo...	While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
Rockin'	Oh, perfect. Now that's art.
Marge, it happened again!	Okay, Dad's my hero. Why is he my hero?
Loser.	My hero isn't famous...
Pathetic.	...isn't rich...
He makes me sick.	...and isn't in any history books...
I'm so glad I was forced to come.	That's what heroes do.
'CAUSE I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / LISA NEVER LIES / I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / AND HEROES NEVER DIE / JUST ONE GUITAR! SLUNG WAY DOWN LOW / YEAH ONE GUITAR! / WHERE DID MY LAWNMOWER GO?!	Yes, which means that nobody wins. The money goes back in the school general fund. But we will put both speeches online, behind a pay wall. Now, please fold up your chairs and stack them.
Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.	Hey, Dad.
When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.	Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.
There's sausage being made? Where?	Oh, dad, you don't want details. No one wants to see the sausage being made.
Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.	Homie, there's someone here to see you.
Ooh!	Mr. Simpson, I am the executive vice president of the World Football Federation.
Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.	I'm sure you are familiar with the World Cup. the quadrennial drama unmatched on the planet!
Of course I am, but how do you know?	Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.
Much better.	I mean it spread like wildfire.
Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession.	Mr. Simpson, I am the new executive vice president of the WFF. We need outsiders like you to come to the World Cup, as our guests, and ref our games properly.
What do you think, sweetie?	Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession.
The two thousand eight Super Bowl?	Dad, they're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth!
It's okay. I'm an American!	The two thousand eight Super Bowl?
Sure, why not?	Oh, I wish! Eli Manning's pass to David Tyree... But about the World Cup. I need your answer now.
"""Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster brand soccer ball."" Thanks, book!"	Sure, why not?
I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.	Look, you got us a free trip. Just slack off and cash your check like you always do.
What the?!	I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.
Here you go, honey.	Eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on...
The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.	How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?
Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker.	The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.
Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.	Homer Simpson! I would like to congratulate you on your fine officiating today.
You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!	Well?
Red card!	We have two ways. Two very good ways.
Get outta here!	Let me give that back to you.
How fresh?	While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball, and a fresh pork sandwich.
Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild.	Stupid lady.
Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.	Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down?
Why so quiet?	Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
I'm listening. And it better be devastating.	I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. Eh, why not?
Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.	You weren't Lisa's hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!	Where are you going?
Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. Give me another.	So the rumors are true. We knew you'd find out your daughter's original speech topic was Marie Curie. And now we need you to fix the greatest game of all: the World Cup Final.
I carry my own.	All right. But we've run out of sugarcane.
If I bet it, I could double it. But on who?	Guys, guys, you're both right.
Thanks for telling me. I was gonna tape it.	You know that Brazil is going to win!
Wave a Brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.	Remember, I'll be watching.
You're a funny one to tell me about deception.	Don't do it, Dad. Don't cheat.
Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness.	I'm sorry you weren't my first choice. In fact... I had my doubts about using you at all.
It was pity-fridged!	You put it on the fridge!
Oh, come here.	All right, you're hurt. I understand. But when I made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. You became the hero I thought you could be, Dad.
Everything's right with the world.	Oh, come here.
That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed.	Everything's right with the world.
No penalty!	No penalty! He dove, Dad!
I repeat, no penalty!	No penalty!
No penalty!	I repeat, no penalty!
Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants.	You broke a deal with us. And we have lost a fortune.
No penalty.	You are free to go.
I've never seen anything so beautiful.	Wow, the Amazon is just like I pictured it after seeing all those pictures online.
Cleats.	Hey-hey, what--
Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.	Homie, what happened?
Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's...	Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.
Once intoxicated, we had a great idea.	Oh damn, the plaster's flaking again.
Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!	The only way out is in!
Best recess ever!	Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!
Help me guys! Guys?	Best recess ever!
Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?	Senator!
But I did learn something from all this. The sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.	Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?
Oh, are the kids with you?	I'll come back with the fire truck. I just have to get the kids to school first.
Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?	Hi, Dad! / Homer.
Don't worry. It's bottom all right.	At least we hope it's bottom.
Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?	"It's pronounced ""Luca-dollar"". That's my competition name. I'm a competitive eater."
"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!"	No! You didn't hear anything!
Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!	It's for people who haven't had heart problems!
I will when you open your mind to change!	Quit comparing me to Ben Chapman!
Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.	"Really? ""Justin Blobber"" over there doesn't remind you of anyone?"
She can smash a salad.	You can do better!
Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine.	"Oh, there's my magazine. Why, look at this! ""What every father should do for his daughter."""
Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?	Right, right, right, right. According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!
Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion.	It's not a punishment. But you can't just eat dinner. You have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash.	Not fake attentive. Real attentive.
She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad!?	No! Homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. You have to act like someone you'd want Lisa to marry. If you just act like yourself, she might just... Oh, you know?
Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!	Homie, I love you. But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble.
I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.	Well, I was just trying to--
"...so Marge says I gotta ""ask Lisa on a date."""	I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.
Feels weird.	Now you quit stallin' and call your daughter like a man!
Oh, It's ringing!	Omigod, omigod, omigod!
Uh, Hello. Lisa. I know your brother and...	Hello?
Stupid, stupid, stupid!	Uh, Hello. Lisa. I know your brother and...
Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together, sometime...	Dad? Did you just call?
Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--	Just the two of us?
Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!	I'd love that. See you tonight!
Hello, Marjorie.	Hair volumizer... Cologne?
Yes, well it's a special evening. And I thought it best not to look like a monkey.	Homie! You look like an N.B.A. coach!
Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me.	All right, you've made your point.
Ooh, pepperoni!	Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me.
Is there no end to your fault-finding?!	Homie, I don't have a problem with you. Except your buttons are off one.... Actually, this is a collar button... see? It goes like this...
Maggie, help me with this shirt.	Is there no end to your fault-finding?!
Nope. Now, how's that drink? Can I Temple up that Shirley?	So, Mr. Burns never realized it was Maggie who saved the plant?
"Uh, yeah, help me out here. What is the ""normal amount"" of entrees per person?"	Well, have we decided?
I mean for adults!	Eh, one, sir.
No. I mean for adult males.	One.
All right, I'll have the lasagna.	Yes. I repeat, one.
Oh, uh. Vegetarian. Can the red sauce be cow blood?	All right. Meat or vegetarian?
Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!	Homer, could you come with me for a minute?
Um. Excuse me, Lisa.	We need to have a conversation in loud whispers.
A friend from high school.	Um. Excuse me, Lisa.
I'm sorry, that's all very nice. But I can't forget what you said.	"Homie, I felt terrible when you said I felt ""stuck"" with you. But then, I realized: I am stuck with you. I couldn't stop loving you if I tried."
Where'd you get that dress?	I know, Homie. I know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet. But I also know you well enough to know that this will work.
Wow. Wow. That looks just like the dress you wore on Project Runway.	Remember that sewing machine you say I never use? Well, I sold it and bought this dress!
Oh, right. I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store. All is forgiven. Let's have dinner.	Sh-sh-sh!
Thanks, Frenchy.	And your lasagna with cow blood, sir.
Oh, how much did I eat?!	Please let it be a bear that did this.
Pfft! I'm as healthy as a horse.	Homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself.
Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now.	If you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. That's all I ask...
Legs pumping! Blood flowing!	Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now.
Two at a time! Heart exploding.	Legs pumping! Blood flowing!
I'm number two!	Stop! Stop with the wailing and the gnashing, and the . Homer is not dead! I have made a copy!
Somebody kill me.	Oh Dad, you're back! Just in time for my recital!
Amen, baby! Did you make potato salad for the wake?	Now Homie, I hope you'll use this second chance to live a more sensible life.
I'm back! Comin' through!	Oh heya Midge, uh, here we are again, huh? And, uh, here. My new card.
Yeah, I can die all I want -- Frink's got Homers like the Tuileries has park benches. Huh? Wonder where I picked that up.	I'm back! Comin' through!
Two weeks?	Homer, you'll be all right. But no solid food for two weeks.
Wait a minute!	We are gathered here to mourn the passing of yet another Homer Simpson. Beloved father... precious memories... local character... etcetera. Okay, we're ready for the crematorium bot.
Yo. Where's my body?	All is not lost! I was able to download Homer's brain into this flash drive. It'll have to do.
Bonk! Bonk! Bonk! Ooh, corner! Ba-donk!	Oh, you used up all your clones, you fat, fat, fat reckless, fat pig! From now on you're just going to be a face on a monitor. So, enjoy screensaver mode.
Hey kids, wanna chase Grandpa Homer around the house?	Let me just say this once: I'm good.
It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge.	After thirty-five years of wifely obedience, I'm married to a face on a screen.
"Oooh, ""Goody Gobble""!"	It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge.
Woo-hoo, liquid center power-up!	"Oooh, ""Goody Gobble""!"
Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot.	Things aren't great with Lisa. If it wasn't for that squirrel that eats our bird food, we'd have nothing to talk about.
Just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...	Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot.
No, no, no! Don't pull me out before you click eject! That hurts like a mother--	Nothing for thirty years. You're perfect for each other.
Son, can you put me in 3-D for a second?	No, no, no! Don't pull me out before you click eject! That hurts like a mother--
Why you little! I'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!	Son, can you put me in 3-D for a second?
'Bout time!	It's only natural to miss a man you buried a hundred and twenty-seven times.
Hey! Where's my junk?	'Bout time!
Whew!	Hey! Where's my junk?
Sure.	Wow. Wow. You've really grown. We should have dinner sometime.
Body. To Moe's.	Sure.
Open your stance a little, there. Yeah, that's it. Do your worst, kids!	Suddenly I want a different dessert.
Come on! Hug your Grampa, boys!	Open your stance a little, there. Yeah, that's it. Do your worst, kids!
Threat perceived. Terminate! Terminate!	Come on! Hug your Grampa, boys!
Kids are so afraid of being terminated.	Threat perceived. Terminate! Terminate!
Lookin' good, Santa's Little Hybrid.	Kids are so afraid of being terminated.
I think that's about to change.	Wow. Everyone's back together except Gramma and Grampa.
Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade.	After thirty-five years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right.
Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.	Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade.
Sit down.	"On the next week of Fox Television's, ""The Simpsons:"""
Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!	See ya, Homer! / Bye, Dad!
Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?	I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth graders. Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail.
Oh, everyone does, son. That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit.	I didn't mean to make her pregnant. I just hate art so much.
Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that.	So, uh, your boy's got magic knock-up powers, huh?
Yeah... well just talk about sports!	Not true! Whenever I compliment your virility, you act all weird. And you are very virile.
Flanders! Can we borrow your spatula?!	Homie, I can't find my spatula! Can you get another one?
And you never bought a replacement?	That was my spatula!
What is your problem, boy?	Yeah... y'know, I just don't think we're gonna get in to see him today.
Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts.	Maybe when I've got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don't know, a low bar?
Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!	Aren't those full of germs?
Thanks, Moe, I... huh. Must've left my wallet at home.	Nobody comes into my bar and kidnaps two paying customers.
Fat Tony?	Don't tell us our business!
Hey!	That's right, Fat Homer.
Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop.	I need your boy to make a baby.
Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it.	Y'know. Just sayin'.
Anything else?	One more thing -- it better be a boy.
How is it my fault?	Hey, this is all your fault.
LET THEM RUCK THE NIGHT AWAY!	How is it my fault?
I just did that because it was a series of funny words!	I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf...
Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse.	Well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to Hell!
Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here.	Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse.
Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls.	What's his problem?
Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.	Big deal. I don't like girls either.
Now where's she going?	Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.
Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!	Now where's she going?
That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.	Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!
Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.	Ew. That tastes horrible!
You know, pregnant is pregnant...	Whoa! They like each other!
We're not lost, boy. Not by a longshot. We just have to set the mood.	What are you talking about?
LET THEM PLAY! WE WON'T LOOK, WE'LL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY...	We're not lost, boy. Not by a longshot. We just have to set the mood.
BE THAT AS IT MAY	WE'LL BE DEAD...SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
FAT TONY'S HORSE IS GAY!	BE THAT AS IT MAY
ROLL IN HAY!	I DO NOT HEAR NO BANGING / NO SOUND OF HORSESHOES CLANGING...
I DON'T CARE ABOUT TOMORROW / WE NEED TRUE HORSE LOVE TODAY	OR TOMORROW WE WILL PAY!
HERE'S A BLANKET THEY CAN BORROW	I DON'T CARE ABOUT TOMORROW / WE NEED TRUE HORSE LOVE TODAY
Ah, young love.	ROLL IN HAY!
You monster! My knees will be in my throat!	Ay carumba
Teach him not to pee during parades. He'll get more work.	Cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot.
Ooh! Can I lick the ceiling?	Yay! A mess!
Fine.	Homer! For the last time, do not drink the Yahtzee dice!
Ooh, doubles!	Fine.
Because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four.	Why don't we have any couples friends?
Okay, sweetie, I'll call the Van Houtens.	I want friends. Any friends.
But...	Not the Van Houtens.
They all make good points.	"The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa, and you hit her. And the last thing she texted, before she died, was ""I got your message."" G'night."
Oh. Thank you. Why was that on the Military History Channel?	Come and get 'em!
Can I check out what toys they have?	And stay in the living room. Don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.
Dinner party at the neighbors'. At least I can drink.	No.
Walking distance, Marge. I've been looking forward to this all week!	One drink.
You know, I have more cheeks.	Homer!
They'll get their blood money.	Yes. Yes! So for the next three hours, I welcome you to the moors of--
Question. It says here the murderer is Admiral Wainsworth. Who's that?	They'll get their blood money.
Well, you know--	You've... you... you've given away the game.
"Well, as we say in Russia: ""Goodbye in Russian""!"	Just so you know, Homer, you were going to be a dashing Russian Count with multiple lovers!
Uh, nice night for a walk.	"Well, as we say in Russia: ""Goodbye in Russian""!"
Do you want to be more alone?	I'd like to be alone for a while.
More?	Yes.
What the?	Mm, hm.
Okay, I slept on the couch, and I flipped the sweaty cushions over. What else can I do?	That's good.
Mmmm--	It's okay. I mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. I think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized.
Because... Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?	"Don't you dare say ""ostrich eyes."""
I see.	Nothing. I give up. No more dinner parties. Our whole social life will be us watching TV and you going to Moe's.
Woo-hoo!	I see.
Well, if that's how you think it has to be.	Woo-hoo!
It might be easier with Maggie. She's always getting letters from the Daycare center.	Yes, for us. But not for Lisa! Never for Lisa. We're going to help her make friends.
So... where are all the friends?	After this we'll do makeovers!
Who are you?	I don't know! I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.
Well, Lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus Frickin' Huebner!	Gus Huebner. I was on Lisa's coed soccer team two years ago.
Yeah. Nothin-- Nothing's going on.	Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I'm fine.
Lots of pizza.	Pizza. Mmmm.
See, Marge. Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone.	It's not optional.
You gave away ice cream?!	I wouldn't say I paid someone to be your friend. I just gave her money for records and ice cream.
Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent.	Lisa. Lisa, wait...
"I'm sorry she rejected your ""I'm Sorry,"" cake, but in a way, I'm not. I guess what I'm trying to say is I like cake."	Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent.
Is that the boy you named me after?	Let me tell you a little story about a chubby, unpopular boy named Homer.
You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?	A relationship I continued to this day.
Dad, is that story really true?	Lisa's door's unlocked!
Crap!	Mother's Day?!
Don't worry, Marge. As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp.	Last day of scho-ol! Last day of scho-ol! Found my summer hob-by! Banging pots togeth-er!
Needs more numerators.	Goodbye forever, multiplication!
Ah, July fourth-- No fireworks?! Can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?	Needs more numerators.
Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her.	My baby... back ribs!
Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, I will. I've mapped it out.	While Bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our Pop's brainpan.
I've had my problems with sparklers.	Maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.
Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are.	No, no, but I shoot rockets into his-a face. Here's-a my card. Don't forget to treasure it.
Kaboom.	Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are.
Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career.	Kaboom.
If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten.	Why do you come here and remind me of a time in my life when I made a-tons of money doing a-what I love?
Woo hoo!	Have you ever considered a reverse-equity mortgage?
Okay. Let's make some fireworks.	While Bart was in Hell, Homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone.
Oh thank God. A rickety bridge.	Now drive slowly and carefully to my workshop. It's in-a the Cobblestone a-District.
Can I pitch something?	Don't worry. We'll be safe in the gas lamp district.
My boy's having a bad night. We should get the show on the road.	All right, start over. Coarse gunpowder, ball, wadding, tamp, tamp, tamp, tamp, tamp... fine gunpowder in the pan... c'mon...
Come on. Let's go. I can't stand to see my family unhappy on America's holiest day.	My boy's having a bad night. We should get the show on the road.
Hey, Super Mario. Don't you tell me about America!	Actually, July second is when congress declared independence -- the date that should be celebrated.
No, you're a-wrong!	Idiot! I'm-a right!
Who the hell is that?!	July second! I am quoting John Adams!
One more year, tops.	I WANNA HOLD YOU TILL I DIE
Then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!	"I live-a longer than you! I taking a ""senior spin"" class. Always increasing the tension!"
Believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem.	I WANNA HOLD YOU TILL THE FEAR IN ME SUBSIDES
It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.	Congratulations, you have ruined a beautiful song.
I don't!	I apologize to Dan Hill and all of our viewers.
Usher! Will you stop that person who's shushing?!	I don't!
Out of my reach? Must... make... effort...	Hey, Dad! We made popcorn!
What's on TV?	Mr. Simpson, you earned this.
Why you little! I'll show you who's a Flabbi!	Well no... but he's not a rabbi. More of a Flabbi.
All muscle. In Minnesota I'd be a supermodel!	All right, you're not a Flabbi! Okay! I got it!
Yes, son. We can.	No, no, it's a big thing.
Huh? Oh.	Homer, get up!
Yeah, yeah, great. I guess my getting-up days are over.	Dad, are you okay?
Lisa, what are you doing?	Um... with me, it's easier to say which ones aren't hookers.
But...	Wrapping you in bubble wrap. I can't always be around to protect you, so it will.
Oh Lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. Why I could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. That's why I never plan more than four seconds ahead.	But...
Now come on, give Daddy a hug.	I guess you're right.
Bubble wrap!	Now come on, give Daddy a hug.
Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!	Bubble wrap!
Me neither.	I suppose we should exchange insurance information. I don't have any.
I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.	Brief nudityyy!
I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.	The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
I'm in charge. You do what I say.	Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again.
That better not mean what it means when I say it.	I'll get to it when I get to it.
We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it!	Maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.
You poor woman. Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. You rest. I'll be the boy's father now.	Simpson!
Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.	Look, I'll drink another glass of milk.
You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do.	Oh it!
Eat your broccoli.	The sit is on.
Eat your broccoli.	No.
Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...	I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside.
Jebus loves Tebow.	Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team.	And so... the fat man caves. If you need me, I'll be up in my room eating cereal. Half a bowl of cereal.
I can get another job! Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a southern anything.	This has got to stop! If you don't go to work you're going to get fired!
Uh, works for me.	Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end.
You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!	Oh no, the broccoli!
Come on. Lick it!	You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!
C'mon, lick it!	Come on. Lick it!
I don't know. Eat your broccoli.	Where are we?
We're on an old-time boat!	No.
I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.	Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat.
Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you?	Dad, look! I did a round turn with two half hitches.
You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!	So what if I am?
Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming.	I'm old enough to choose my own things to hate. And the things I like! And I like being a sailor.
I finally got over my sea sickness.	"I learned that left is called ""port""!"
I hate the Golden Age of Sail.	I'm sorry we had to discipline you. On the positive side, you won't miss out on the father/son hornpipe dance.
Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean.	I'm in charge. You do what I say.
Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--	Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean.
What the?	Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--
Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!	What the?
I love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name.	Yi-yo-yu!
Yeah...	You know what, Homer? I always wanted to eat a parrot. What's the big deal? It's just like a green chicken.
Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!	Dad! We can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse!
I'm dropping the anchor!	No, we need to sail!
You've never done what I say! Ever!	Can't you just do what I say?!
Aye-aye, sir.	Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet!
Does this answer your question?	So, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?
I GOT A BAD SUNBURN AND I WAS CRAPPED ON BY A SEAGULL / I DON'T SEE ANY LIFEBOATS AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS LEGAL	WAY HEAL AWAY! / WE'LL HEAL AWAY JOE
WAY HEAL AWAY! / WE'LL HEAL AWAY JOE!	I GOT A BAD SUNBURN AND I WAS CRAPPED ON BY A SEAGULL / I DON'T SEE ANY LIFEBOATS AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS LEGAL
Absolutely not.	Hey! I was listenin' to that!
"My one weakness: the third ""really."" Come with me."	Really, really, really?
Turn right here. I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.	But that's so many sandwiches!
Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms.	Homer! This is my freezerino.
Okily Dokahama?!	It's the name of the freezer!
It's all gonna thaw!	Right next to Mount Fu-Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
Don't you give up on me!	It's all gonna thaw!
And I will wait and worry!	I'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches.
Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!	...so, I cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog...
Lucky.	Dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating.
Familyicious.	Can someone put butter on me?
What are you doing here, freezer stealer?	Yeah, sure.
Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!	Well, I felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me.
Yeah! And aren't!	Never claimed to be.
None.	Homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?
Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut.	All you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
Well, you woke up the right man in bed.	I'm sorry I woke you up. I'm just so anxious about tomorrow. What if the store fails? What if I fail?
I love you, Marjorie. And I've had my share of failures, sure. And sometimes I get pretty nervous. But thanks for talking it out with me. I think I can finally get to sleep now.	Well, you woke up the right man in bed.
No, no, I'd like to see the manager.	Hello! No change for the meter.
Marge, come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day!	Mrs. Boss! Some fat blob wants to see you.
Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day. But don't worry. I told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. You do have drone delivery, right? I kinda promised that.	You're supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted then I changed my mind and I hate it so much I'm faking stomach aches to get out of it.
Dammit!	We don't have drone delivery! You'll have to find a substitute!
Don't worry, baby.	I need a six-foot party sub. Lots of mayonnaise. And I mean lots. Never stop squirting mayo.
Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run.	How could they open another franchise so close to me?
Hillbillies!	Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run.
Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee.	Simpson, introduce me to this almond-eyed beauty, and all is forgiven.
Whew!	Sorry you died! Put the body with the others.
Marge, have you ever seen pants do this?	Homer, if I ever seem that senile, get a gun and... What are you doing with that gun?!
I'm a litigious business man and I need a coffee to go.	Oh. Now I completely understand you.
Why do these things happen to innocent victims? I was just about to become a million dollar crotch model!	I got this.
Please tell me I'm still beautiful!	If you'll just give me back my original investment, I'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries.
Well, family, we should be proud. We took on corporate America and broke even.	All right, Marge, you've got a deal.
Mmm. Sandwich.	D'oh!
What?	Right here?
"Keep your pants on, Marge. It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"	Homie! Our prayers have been answered!
Oh, that's fine then.	Dad, it's not a private school. It's free.
I'll say it, Marge, it's in Hell! The Inferno! Perdition! Arizona without the golf!	I couldn't help noticing this school is located in... I'm not one to judge, but... um...
Nooo!	We do have golf, but all the greens are tricky.
Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.	Look, as educators, our job is to gently nurture your child's passion.
Yeah, I'll be sure to take a look at that.	You know, we have many opportunities for parent involvement...
No, boy. I want you to do it.	Homer? That-that's my dad. I can't hurt him.
Bart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus. Now come on, boy! Pull me apart like string cheese.	What? Why?
Which one's yours?	Well, I'll tell you who is supposed to be here -- class mal-edictorian, Beelzebart Simpson!
Stupid blood. Asking me for a favor.	Ow.
The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!	Ooh Marge, that was fast. Yeah, that's it, baby. Grab my chest with your cold icy hands.
All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!	The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!
The power of Chrysler compels you!	All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!
Hey... if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license.	Take a picture, it'll last longer, man.
He is me!	Well, I traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich.
Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!	Homer, do something!
So... yeah. Things aren't perfect with the missus and me. And by the way, nice melons.	What kind of afterlife is this? Can't even strangle my dead kid.
I can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.	I'm just happy you're happy.
Can you be more specific?	Homer Simpson!
Well, hello.	Huh. Might as well clean this while I'm killing myself.
A ghost!	Well, hello.
Don't yell at me! I'm a double widower! But I can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!	I feel like a ghost the way you haven't been paying attention to me. Plus, I'm dead.
I think he gets it. See, he--	Won't the other Homer be a problem?
Ow! Ooh! What the? Mmm! I smell toast!	I think he gets it. See, he--
Ooh... pork chops with gravy!	Here we go... here we go... here we go...
Hey... but today's not Pork Chop Tuesday... or Gravy Thursday.	Ooh... pork chops with gravy!
Woo hoo!	I also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.
Oh, I love Canadian on Canadian violence. Oh baby, this is so great! Thank you so much!	Woo hoo!
Wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. What's going on?	Oh, I love Canadian on Canadian violence. Oh baby, this is so great! Thank you so much!
No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!	"They kept yelling ""La Joconde -- her smile will die!"""
Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy.	You ate the food and looked in the mirrors! They're staying.
And if you trust them, I trust them too.	You know what? I trust them not to smoke.
Safety first.	And if you trust them, I trust them too.
Bad news, bears. Forecast calls for nothing but rain.	Nature is God's ash tray.
If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?	Choke on our harmless fumes.
Ha! I gotcha!	Wait, wait. Turn on the faucet so no one'll get suspicious.
You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.	Ha! I gotcha!
I know just the place.	Please, show some compassion for two good people who just can't stop smoking.
Lisa! Motorcade!	What about it?
Woo-hoo!	Congratulations Simpson. You're now my Chief Energy Innovation Marketing Officer.
"Woo-hoo? I don't know... ""Fracking"" is one of those scary Lisa words."	All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.
Thanks, Charlie. Maybe fracking isn't so bad.	Homer, game starts in an hour. Don't forget to set your fantasy lineup.
I'm not screwing you over. No, uh... I'm not screwing you over. I'm not screwing you over.	"Then say yes to this raise, this promotion, and this flannel shirt which says ""I'm not screwing you over!"""
Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. But what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.	I'm so proud of you, poppa.
And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.	Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. But what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
Authentic Italian food.	And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.
Useless left-handed crap.	Authentic Italian food.
Magical nonsense.	Useless left-handed crap.
Expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.	Magical nonsense.
Pornography and nachos.	Expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.
High-quality Spanish language programming.	Pornography and nachos.
High-quality methamphetamines.	High-quality Spanish language programming.
Laundry. Homework. Pranks. Poop, poop and poop.	High-quality methamphetamines.
Because I've never gotten a promotion before. Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. So judge me all you want.	How could you sell fracking for Mr. Burns?
Good, judge away.	I am judging you.
Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr. Burns gets five thousand dollars!	Mr. Simpson? Rebuttal?
Mr. Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights.	COGENT !
Excellent?	Mr. Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights.
Well... one.	Excellent?
Oh baby...	"I have embarked on a ""beneficial friendship"" with a woman with whom I have nothing in common. Her opinions are abhorrent to me. But the passion... well, look at these racy texts she sends me."
Well, I'm no Carl when it comes to this stuff. But I ain't no Lenny neither. And I would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt.	Oh baby...
Glad I could be of help...	Hmm... Well then I must harden my heart against such an outcome.
Marge? Why didn't you sign?	The gas rights transfer form for 742 Evergreen Terrace was never signed by Marge Simpson!
Marge Simpson... I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.	I already felt the pride of energy independence!
Oh yeah, great. Great, Marge. Great work. Thanks to you, Springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. And like all boom towns it would have lasted forever.	I played this just perfectly.
Was on fire. Was. I finally get a job I was good at, and now I have to give it up.	Our water was on fire.
Wait, Mr. Burns! I'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! Sometimes I think she and I have nothing in common.	So, you've come begging not to be fired? Smithers, turn my back on this man. Maximum huff!
Marge likes sushi, I like gum that squirts in your mouth. She's into romantic comedies, I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. Yep, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways.	Nothing in common, eh? Tell me more...
So you don't miss that politics lady at all?	Different, exactly. That's why I had to give my woman the old heave-ho.
Gravy Thursday.	Stop laying about, you! There's work to be done.
"You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use ""fracking"" as an easy bad guy. But it can save this country!"	Homer! Turn off that horrible machine!
Wait... I finally get what you're saying. Fracking is great. But the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!	Our. Water. Was. On. Fire!
Hey, a couch is a couch.	Wiggle in. Get comfortable.
Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's.	Homer! Homer. I think there's someone downstairs.
The eyes in that picture are following me.	Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's.
Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?	Uh, that's a mirror.
We'd better send the dog down. Come on. Here's your chance to protect us, boy. Come on.	Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart.	Ow!
All set. When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom.	We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart.
A robot with a catchphrase!	Bite my shiny metal ass!
Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?	...the future!
Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.	I don't know. You die?
Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion...	I hate it when they get quiet.
Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends?	It's true! I'm empty inside.
Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?	A strike! A totally legitimate strike!
You future guys have a word for everything... pal.	Romance.
My ears are burning.	I remember why I'm here! To kill Homer Simpson!
A boxing glove!	Not yet, but they will be.
But we bowled together.	A boxing glove!
You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.	What the?! My ass is about to project something.
What the?	If Homer's dead, why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control?
I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?	"Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful. Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer and explore this time period. Find out why people would ever pay for ""freemium games."""
Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion...	I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?
"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."""	Get a load of those freaks.
And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.	"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."""
Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry.	And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.
Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...	Kill all humans... kill all humans...
Who is that?!	And the other person is...
My bowling buddy.	We're here.
Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...	Well, you can't have it!
Prove it. When's your birthday?	Dad, it-it's me!
Ha! February has no twenty-third!	February twenty-third.
I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. Why you little... why you little...	Oh, are you good at your job?
Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years.	Dad, we have beer in our time!
What the?	Wow, it's working! I guess the instructions were in English.
Aww, I will treasure this forever.	Hey, here's a souvenir photo of you guys comin' outta my chest.
Good night, friend. You'll always have a special place here with us.	The old-fashioned way.
SIMPSONS, IN THE / FUTURE -- SPACE JOKES! / FLYING THROUGH TOWN / WHAT ARE THOSE TUBES / I WONDER WHAT / ICE CREAM'S LIKE NOW / MAYBE IT'S HOT / OR SOME NEW TEMPERATURE THEY INVENTED... That's it, we're done.	Well, perhaps the one of you that is female should go console her.
You wanna talk about it?	Terrible.
Oh, thank you.	No.
I won't laugh at you. Let's see--	No, you'll laugh at me.
Marge, please don't say anything. It never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs.	I'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
What camping trip?	Well, anyway Bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend.
Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?	The one you booked for us at Owl Haven. The one you have to reserve a year in advance.
You're right. No one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. Certainly not me. Pass the gravy?	I don't remember that!
Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost.	Don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! Labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!
Excuse me, but grass is poking through.	Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost is a converted parking lot.
Poking through.	Parking lot.
Poking through.	Parking lot.
Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby.	My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.
Not you.	Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby.
So, what do you say, Marge?	Not you.
And I want you to believe me too. Isn't it great how much we agree?	I want so much to believe you.
Compared to the rest of these people, yeah.	Oh, that's convenient.
Look, I really need a campsite. My wife is making sandwiches!	We've all read the terms and conditions, Milhouse.
What about Mosquito Cove?	Sorry, reservations are a year in advance.
Skunk Canyon?	Booked.
Ooh! How 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?	Booked every year since two thousand three.
Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!	Sir, that is a movie.
You know, alarm code three six seven nine. Three six seven nine!	Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!
Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip.	Those were your father's sweatpants.
A CAMPING WE WILL GO...	Once again, I've been saved from any consequences. It'll keep happening till one day I create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. Thanks, boy.
A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...	BUT WHERE? I STILL DON'T KNOW!
Homer Simpson, I love you.	A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...
Cars shaped like cupcakes!	A world of anarchic free expression!
All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?	I'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent.	Now you know the wind does kick up here. Hope you went three feet down with your tent stakes.
Hey man, can I bum a tent?	Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent.
Hey Marge!	Does that look like something I'd do?
We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!	Hey Marge!
Aw, let me get a picture of that.	We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!
This place is great. Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!	Suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.
Get... in... the tent!	It's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.
Just like I planned.	Homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip and I got one.
I understand. I already signed up for this place next year. I Gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.	You got very lucky this time. Don't push it.
I'll take those.	Help me, desert weirdoes!
Beware the butterfly's sting! What the?	I'll take those.
Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?	Look at all these monstrosities.
It's like some kind of guitar central.	(IMPRESSED NOISE
Stig. You've got a name that's not a name.	Okay, let me guess, dude, you're an axe-man -- you're looking to score a new blade.
What the rock?	Try this on.
I did a lick?	Now that was a lick.
Oh my god... I'm amazing.	Dude, usually it takes years to learn such neck confidence. Now check this out:
I'm not set at all.	Okay. Now oh, how are you set for stage lights?
This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels.	OOh, what about gels?
MUSIC! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!	WHAT IS THAT RACKET?
Beautiful music, baby.	WHAT?
Sure it is. You know I've always loved laying things down. Grooves are just the latest.	The bass guitar? This doesn't really seem like... you.
Oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? It's so easy.	It's so cool to have another musician in the family!
So easy.	Uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--
I don't know guys. I'm not sure I'm feeling this. The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.	This menu was right -- good things do happen... at 'Zerz.
I almost forgot the most important thing.	Garage bands rule!
Great practice, guys. What do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?	I almost forgot the most important thing.
"Oh... yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer. But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. No disrespect to world music. I love world music."	Excuse me... My wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band. And uh, perhaps you need a singer?
That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music.	WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES / I WISH THAT I COULD FANTASIZE / PULL A DREAM RIGHT OUT OF THE AIR / TAKE A CHANCE TURN IT INTO A PRAYER...
Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?	FOCUS LIKE A LASER BEAM / I'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL I WANT SOMETHING GREAT / HOPIN' FOR A DREAM...
We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.	I think we all felt something.
That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in.	And it sounds like Hovercraft.
Cover...	That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in.
"""R"" ""O"" ""K"" ""C""."	...craft!
Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new.	"""R"" ""O"" ""K"" ""C""."
Apu, what's wrong?	Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new.
I still want one.	You don't know what a per diem is.
Buddy, buddy. Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night. You just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine.	I still want one.
Well son, I do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write... down the names of and then cover. But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds.	Everyone loves you, Dad. You could become a famous rock star!
Yep. It's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. Pretty unforeseen...	Yeah, you really get that it's all about the music.
Guys, I really need your honesty here. At the Squidport Senior Jamboree... was I too in the pocket?	Gentlemen, I think we've found what we're looking for.
How?	Uh, he passed away.
What kind of erotic asphyxiation?	How?
Oh...	What kind of erotic asphyxiation?
I think I can answer for Apu. He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted.	Apu, you're the only man on the entire internet whose got the pure Sungazer sound. Will you be our new lead singer and join us on our stadium tour?
Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--	Uh, actually... I...
Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.	I gotta say, I'm kind of jealous of Apu getting a break like that.
I want his fame and fortune so much! Why must the Lords of Rock be so cruel?!	Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.
It's something you make sketches about.	What's a game show?
I'm not jealous. I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.	HOPIN'...
You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.	Wow, he's right.
"Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? ""No Reply at All,"" ""Land of Confusion,"" ""Throwing it All Away,"" ""Illegal Alien,"" ""I Can't Dance,"" and I'm sure I don't need to mention... ""Invisible Touch!"""	You mean more popular but not as good?
What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band!	You know, I've been known to sing a little...
Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands.	You can't just kick him out--
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!	How can there be two Yokos--
Do I sound okay?	Are you okay?
They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.	You sound great! Your licks are really... juicy.
Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics.	"You didn't join a band to become famous like in ""Almost Famous."" You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy."
Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?	Apu is a good man. He sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the Costington Center.
I'll never have a per diem.	Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent.
Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if I didn't help him get over his stage fright with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt...	I'll never have a per diem.
Backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass.	Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if I didn't help him get over his stage fright with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt...
Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. What a sellout. Cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat...	Backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass.
Let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt.	Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. What a sellout. Cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat...
I'm sorry, Apu. I thought you were living your dream life, so naturally I wanted to ruin it. But now I know things stink, so I'm okay with it.	Homer!?
Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?	What is the point? I am trapped like a Kwik-E-Mart hot dog on a roller.
HOPIN'! HOPIN'!	DREAMS ARE GREAT OR SO IT SEEMS / IF I NEVER FIND ONE I GUESS THAT'S OKAY / I'M HOPIN' FOR A DREAM...
Tight as a drum.	I'll be right home, honey. I've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening.
Mr. Scrooge!	Simpson!
Headin' home, baby.	Hello?
Nothing's gonna stop me now.	Headin' home, baby.
I'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...	Few people know that verdict was overturned in the sequel. Heh.
Hey, um, you gonna be okay?	Yeah, last year I broke it just so the repairman would come. But I'll be fine.
Okay! Okay! I'll stay for one beer.	She took me to a mall and I never saw her again. But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.
But I promised Marge.	Please! Please! Please!
Okay, okay!	Now I'm sittin' on your shoulders! Please!
Hey, what the--	And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give youse a gift: I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time.
I am so late!	Hey, what the--
Marge, think about what you're saying. It's Sir Isaac Newton's birthday!	I never thought I'd say this to someone I cared for, much less my husband, but I'm saying it now: I don't want you here on Christmas.
Yeah?! Well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!	Out now.
The ghost of Marge Future!	We already did it!
Moe, what are you doing?	What kind of a cheapskate gives you one corncob holder for Christmas?
Hey, pal. Can't believe you have to work Christmas Eve.	Two thirty-nine. Who's he foolin'?
Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.	"Nog stands for ""Not Okayed by Government."""
Gimme another one.	Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.
Gimme another one.	Gimme another one.
Yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?	Oh please, stop! Stop it! My religion prohibits me from taking advantage of a fool more than five times. This thing basically has no winners.
Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu. Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?	You know, ironically, in India, they did use the money for schools and they had fantastic results.
Wow.	Well... those hotdogs began life as Twinkies!
I don't wanna ruin the magic and I certainly	Why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?
Next year... this is... your job.	I don't wanna ruin the magic and I certainly
... ...	Next year... this is... your job.
... Ooh!... ...	... ...
Even the anchor store's closed.	Neither do I.
Any uplifting holiday movies?	Even the anchor store's closed.
I guess I'll take the Concentration Camp one.	...airplane that lost its propeller.
Well, if I've gotta spend Christmas Eve alone, at least no one will see me.	And a Merry Christmas to you, sir.
What if I left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?	Just 'cause you're here shouldn't make you sad. This is my seventeenth Christmas alone in a movie theater. This is my family. The guy with the smelly pants, the lady that carries empty cans in a PBS tote bag...
Flanders? What are you doing here?	Wow, Homer, you have a very generous side. Can I borrow like, ten thousand dollars?
"Say Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say ""Jesus."""	Christmas is my busy season. Sold three pairs of scissors this month! Two came back.
Flanders, are you crying?	Well, sir, our good Lord, and my boys are all I've really got. All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through.
Listen. Could I buy a left-handed uh... I don't know, eyelash curler?	Ah, just snowflakes on my mustache.
Um. Maybe.	Sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. Are you just buying this to be nice?
Because Jerk-ass Homer has become Ass-jerk Homer.	Oh, Homer! Unto us this day, a neighbor is born! But why?
You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right.	Well that curled my lashes, but good for you.
I made everyone happy but me. Some Christmas. Feliz Navidad.	My best friend is a great runner!
What the?	No casual racism!
The Nutcracker! Every child's favorite Christmas character! Is this a dream?	What the?
Man, you are a nutcracker. But I've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Well, being without them is worse. Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?	Not a dream. I work at the mall. And it's closed, so scram.
What are you doing here?	All right, listen pal... uh... you wanna go to a party?
Oh my God. Is that girl really doing that?	Where is this party?!
Mmm, load-bearing wall.	Oh my God. Is that girl really doing that?
Woo hoo!	Mmm, load-bearing wall.
This party's great. But all I wish is that I was drinking a beer with my kids right now.	Woo hoo!
Hm?	Homer?
Oh Marge, you found me! You always find me. Now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot.	Homie, I'm your present tonight. And the present is that I'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up. Because I realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do. Or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining.
Oh, well, I've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best.	I thought I had one of those chirping keys.
You have all taught me a Christmas message I'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.	Thank you magical creatures of the mall.
What the? This isn't Halloween!	Each birth is followed by another birth just seconds later.
No.	Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
No!	Are we there yet?
Okay! We're there! Finally!	Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Damn technology!	Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Turn it off!	Are we there yet?
Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked.	"Okay, remember we're parked in the ""Ethnic Princess"" section."
Look! I see land!	Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked.
You planted that on me, man!	Nooo!
Fine. But I'm not paying for the insurance. Oh, what the hell, give me the insurance.	Sorry. No outside pacifiers.
well, that's it. We've visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? I'll tell you: fun. The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials.	And your telegrams will be delivered by --
I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.	Hey, Dad, I see a ride that actually looks decent!
Come on! Start this thing! I'm not impressed.	One seat per human!
This is so fake.	Come on! Start this thing! I'm not impressed.
Uh-oh.	This is so fake.
Prove it.	We've left Earth's atmosphere!
What the? This isn't Halloween.	Welcome, humans. There is nothing to fear. I am Kang the Abductor.
Potato chips!	Whatever you say shall materialize!
Look at all these knobs and buttons. They are clearly a superior race. But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.	Let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...
That's right. Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.	You mean like Europeans were to the Native Americans? Or the Belgians were to the Congo?
Wow. This place is completely alien but everything's in English. Just like Canada.	Slipped on some drool? Larry H. Zeeblezorp will have you rolling in space credits!
Can I turn my phone on?	Wow. This place is completely alien but everything's in English. Just like Canada.
I say we take this bucket home!	Now what?
To Earth!	I say we take this bucket home!
Come on... come on... you son of a--	To Earth!
Yeah, you really went with the purple theme.	Purple landscape... purple trees...
See, Marge?	All well and good. You obviously exercise.
You're the doctor.	Anything you need? Perhaps you'd care to have your ink gland expressed.
Fine.	Homer! You have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!
Okay.	Here you go.
What the?!	Okay.
Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet.	What the?!
What the? Pfft. Gibberish! Pure gibberish!	Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet.
'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.	You're the last vote, Homie.
That kid's got talent, but c'mon!	Hey look, Maggie made you a farewell card.
I get it, Lisa. I finally get it.	Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad?
I'd like rabbit. Lots of rabbit.	You do get a last meal.
Fondue? Welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine.	Our elder Klaunax has been chosen for our ceremonial first bite, after which Homer Simpson will be dipped into a spicy cheese fondue.
Yes! This mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. So long you stupid slobbering... what the?	A transporter beam! Someone is trying to steal our sacrifice!
So, what do you eat, space broccoli?	We are the resistance. We don't believe in the barbaric consumption of other species.
Where are you taking me?	Let's go, Homer.
Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons?	You are about to behold the secret rebel base.
...but perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. Oh, and the golden age of radio.	In a minute! First, noble human Homer Simpson will explain his primitive yet beautiful culture.
What about my family?	Silence! Homer, we will get you back to Earth.
Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you.	Why do you care? It's just your sex mate and spermlings.
Well, it is a great party.	Unfortunately, we only had the means to build the spaceship for one. We spent most of our money on the party.
Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting.	The pod is equipped to fulfill your deepest desires. Just concentrate.
What the?!	Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting.
Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.	What the?!
I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.	No I didn't! You licked it off!
What's that?	I shall take the first bite. It is quite an honor.
It does look delicious.	Part of your magnificent behind. We sliced it off when you were sleeping.
Don't you people realize your queen is dying?	Homer!
Captain's log, Star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. After successfully conquering the Rigelians...	Useless humans! We will send you back to your planet, and your memories will fade. So it will be as if none of this ever happened.
I have such a big ass.	Thank God it's just like her busy box.
Set a course, Mr. Maggie. Anywhere but home.	The cat ate my heart medicine!
We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?	Good ol' Don.
But, wait a minute! That's my job!	Safety Inspector. 7-G.
That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?	Yes. Of course it is. There are two of us, and I've been covering for you all these years.
No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!	But now you won't have me to protect you.
Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?	How was your day?
And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick.	Oh, sweetie...
They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.	"There's a Yiddish word for it: ""shpilkes."""
Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!	Hey, Homer. Carl and I are gonna see if we can sneak out of the men's room without setting off the automatic toilets, ninja-style.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?	Simpson! I want a full plant status report at five o'clock.
It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.	I thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?	You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.
What?! When were you gonna tell me?	None.
The circus? Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid.	"Homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday."
Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion.	Is that true?
Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!	Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion.
How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?	I thought you were going to try to relax.
What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!	I knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
The early bird gets the shaft!	What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.	Shhh!
'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?	Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
Oh! Finally! The business call I've been waiting for! Hello, this is--	'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?
Eh, they'll grow back.	Hey!
Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?	Homer, I have to use the Porta Potty.
Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.	Hey Dad, since we've gotta wait, can't we please see an act?
Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!	I need a new volunteer. How about you, sir?
Okay.	You know, Dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient.
Ooh, patter!	Now we've never met, have we, sir?
No, but we're having fun trying. Wait, I mean three.	Do you have any children?
Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack...	When I snap my fingers you shall be ten years old.
No I'm not.	You are ten years old.
No I'm not.	Yes you are.
No I'm not.	Yes you are.
Yes you are.	Yes you are.
Yes you are.	Yes, yes you are.
Yeah you are too.	Look, I said, you are.
I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!	I'm not convinced.
Ew! Gross!	Now I'm gonna test just how deeply Homer's mind has been affected. Take a sip of this, young man.
Help... help me.	I'm saying he so desperately needs to believe he's ten, that only the original hypnotist who did this can undo the trance without risking permanent damage to Homer's psyche.
Psych!	Dear God!
Oops.	Psych!
Ask for boogers on Bart's half!	Then can we get pizza on the way home?
Get the ball, boy! C'mon!	Booger pizza. You better pray they find that hypnotist, Marge.
Go get it, boy!	Get the ball, boy! C'mon!
Um, Mrs. Simpson?	Well, I guess it'll have to be in Bart's room. And I thought when Homer cut off his thumb was bad.
I'd be too nervous. Have you noticed that she's kinda hot?	Homer, can't you sleep with Mom?
I'm ready to go to school.	If I'm gonna get through this day, I better Irish up my coffee.
I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?	Homer... you're not going to school.
'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores. All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...	I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?
...did I say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...	'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores. All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...
Can I play?	"Every day's the wrong day to wear culottes. You're ""it""!"
I'm beat.	No he doesn't.
Today was fun.	I'm beat.
Why you little--	Yeah! Listen, Homer...do you ever think about what you want to do when you're grown up?
I'll eat in bed. Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... Oh, and TV would be on. Loud.	Why you little--
Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch.	Hey, would you ever wanna have a real job and a family?
...your Ma says I should do something with you. Need some help with your homework?	Lisa...
Wanna see me make a muscle?	I'm done.
Well, that's everything I know that girls like.	Not right now.
Okay.	Listen, Homer. I just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me.
DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO-DOO / DOO DOO DOO D-DOO-DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO D-DOO-DOO D-DOO DOO D-DOO DOO	Okay.
D-DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Y'know, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother.	Thank God they pulled that other safety inspector out of retirement.
Change back to what?	Me too. And you know what? I'm afraid you might... change back.
Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?	Look in the lake. Tell me what you see.
Woo hoo!	I wanted you to enjoy being a kid just a little longer.
What do we do next? What do we do next?	We've returned to Itchy and Scratchy Land, which means you'll have to pay again.
Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever.	Homer, come here.
- parked! I hate stack parking! Wait! Where am I? This isn't the circus! It's an amusement park! The furthest thing from a circus!	You are back!
Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?	Well, here's what happened...
Ooh! I've missed you too.	Homie, I've missed you!
Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid.	Recommended by a kid I used to know.
The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.	You think so?
You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new.	Well... maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again.
What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?	You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new.
Why you little...?!	Get lost.
It's good to be back.	Oh, so good to have you back.
It is!	A bald eagle!
Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!	Homer, quick! Get your shooing broom!
This means war! Boy, bring my toupee!	Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!
Go ahead, boy.	This means war! Boy, bring my toupee!
Uh, Pittsburgh thirty-five, Dallas thirty-one!	Gotcha!
Ha-ha! Stupid eagle! It wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! Marge! Preheat the oven!	Uh, Pittsburgh thirty-five, Dallas thirty-one!
You-- get-- out!	Ha-ha! Stupid eagle! It wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! Marge! Preheat the oven!
I've got him cornered, boy! Bag him up!	You-- get-- out!
Oopsie.	Not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!
Seems almost a shame I'm gonna have to bang you against a wall till you die.	Oopsie.
Um...	No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue. Where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!	Or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild.
Perfect! Just like when we let you name Maggie.	Squawky?
Bye!	Squawky, until I met you, I never thought I could love something bald.
Die!	Hello. I'm Elon Musk.
You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you!	Dad no! Elon Musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!
And now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg.	His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! He changed the way Hollywood drives!
Mmm, raisin detra.	What did bring me to Springfield? Well, to start with, I'm an idea man. It's my raison d'être.
Hey Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow.	That's so sad. Maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to...
Great. And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me.	I am! And I will!
"Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""	Homer!
So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?	"Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
"""Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" It's as old as the Bible."	Homer, if we're gonna carpool together, there's one thing you have to know.
Ditto.	No, it's that I don't talk to anyone unless they provide the mental stimulation I seek.
Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!	Oh wow! That's an idea! White meatballs. Synthetic meat that you can print from your printer. Say something else. Please, now!
What about the chocolate?	Tase... bro... chocolate rain. Use electroplating to remove metal ions from rainwater, making it suitable for drinking!
Um...	Well, come on, keep throwing things at me.
I gotcha!	Oh! This is a break! We're-- we're taking a break!
Well duh!	You're fun!
"Suggestion for the ""suggestion box."""	What are you writing? Share, buddy.
Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em.	Can anyone make a suggestion?
Careful, Elon. He's not as kindly as he appears.	Well, you'll need to increase the capacity of your plant. You cover the costs, you get a hundred percent of the profits.
So... what kind of lunch do you pack?	Hey wait a minute!
Wow. Elon, you're like Willie Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.	So... what kind of lunch do you pack?
Uh, I'd like to offer you something... but all I've got is coffee... with cream!	Wow. Elon, you're like Willie Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.
Come on, I want cream! Give it up! cream and sugar are one thing too many!	Uh, I'd like to offer you something... but all I've got is coffee... with cream!
Wow. Wow. Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. Come on, give me a hug.	Exactly! Exactly! What if we make the cream cup out of sugar so it dissolves in the coffee?
Well, I'm not one for just talking.	Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.
Does that drone do date nights with the wife?	Well, I'm not one for just talking.
SINCE YOU CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY	Oh boy! ELON, ELON YOU'RE MY GUY
Car, go park at work so people think I'm there.	SINCE YOU CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY
You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.	You're welllcome...
More of what?	Tell Musk there's more where that came from.
No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?	What's wrong Homer? Is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?
How do you break up with a guy?	No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?
Wow, you're good at that.	"Here's what you do. You just take his hand, look in his eyes and say ""I don't want to be with you anymore."""
Oh my God! Oh my God! You saved my life. Which is gonna make what I'm about to say even more awkward...	But, uh, three of your hit men don't. Recoil was pretty bad.
Elon, Elon, Elon! I want to say something to you and I don't want you to be inspired by it. I want you to listen.	Whatever you want we'll make it work. Right, Homer?
I don't want to be with you anymore.	No!!!
I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I.	Can I ask why?
It's on your face too!	It's okay. I'll be fine.
Well, I've saved you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain. Use it as you will.	It's on your face too!
On a Miami Dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.	Well, I've saved you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain. Use it as you will.
When you're sixteen I'll drive you to Cincinnati. And you'll see what there is to see.	I just wanted to see if there was a better life. Even for a little bit.
Nothing.	What's wrong, Dad?
The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet..	Elon's log. Earthdate 25 January 2015. I have left Springfield forever. But there are some things I will definitely miss.
I met a guy. A wonderful guy.	Wait a minute. This song was supposedly written by... former Mayor Moleman!
Boy. Sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.	Hyah!
Simpler time.	Whoa. Thinking back, I'm kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom.
What are you doing?	I think we might just make a good team. Like Maggie and Grampa.
Artists.	What's it look like? Writing a song.
I saved us seats!	That works.
Thank you, roll of masking tape!	Oh, thank you, Homie!
Gonna be a tight fit.	Thank you, roll of masking tape!
Well, not Maggie.	Our kids just did something amazing!
Okay, okay. Standing O or die!	Get up!
Woo hoo!	Okay, okay. Standing O or die!
Dammit!	Stop fearing me!
Please keep spinning it. I don't wanna look at it.	Dammit!
Can't you say something to make me feel better?	Please keep spinning it. I don't wanna look at it.
"Fine. I got it. Starting right now, a year-long juice cleanse	 every morning, I get a colonic, and I sleep in a sauna every night."	I'm sorry but I can't. I'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller, and two Presidents were fatter than you, and...
It's not about health, Marge. It's about going crazy.	That's not a healthy way to lose weight.
What the?	You don't have to do this alone.
Hmmm.	What the?
This is it.	Hmmm.
So... you guys are proud of what you are?	"No-no. In fact, quite the opposite. We are ""Big is Beautiful."""
Do you guys serve snacks?	We do not cower in the shadows. We make the shadows!
I have so many questions for you. First of all, is this floor reinforced?	Mustn't forget the diet soda!
You know, maybe I shouldn't be here. I promised my wife I'd lose weight.	I have so many questions for you. First of all, is this floor reinforced?
Ooh, labels.	If I may...
Who are you?	Our loved ones, though precious, can often be a hurdle.
Ooh, like Fat Albert.	Who are you?
Sorry.	"We never use the word ""fat"" here."
I am big.	My dear fat friend, all your wife needs is a little education. Now, repeat after me... I am big.
I have a beauty of a sort to some.	I am beautiful.
Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy.	No one can make me feel bad about who I am because this is who I am.
Marge, kids! Tonight was a turning point in my life.	Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy.
No, Marge! You have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life!	Well that's great, Homie. Just let me finish uploading this photo.
They taught me that I don't need to lose weight, I should just be proud of what I am.	Thank you, Lord. And I'll give up online scrapbooking like I promised.
Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale.	That's worse than what I thought!
I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. It was a poem you were writing about my potential. I'm gonna start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing.	Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you.

Sorry, fellas. There's a movement I have to join. I've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating.	WE'RE BIG! WE'RE PROUD! TWO OF US CAN MAKE A CROWD!
Right here.	Homer Simpson?
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.	Right here.
Comin' back, 'scuse me, pardon me...	Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.
There we go. Comin' up... what can I do for you?	Comin' back, 'scuse me, pardon me...
Guys, I'm comin' back in. Suck in your guts.	Homer, you have to choose. And I think the choice is clear.
I was distinctly promised no math!	No more judgment. No more jokes. We will not be made to feel less than because we are greater than.
Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert.	Oh, kids, stop arguing. Or keep arguing. I don't care. Homer, I'm sorry I tried to help you control your weight. I'm not sure of anything anymore. Sorry I ever open my mouth.
But Marge, I don't want you to ever stop caring about me.	Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert.
Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men.	How can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?
I've never written an eulogy before, but this time I did. Unfortunately, I left it at home.	Oh, dear God. Stick a forklift in him, he's dead.
Thanks, lady.	I've never written an eulogy before, but this time I did. Unfortunately, I left it at home.
What Albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. He knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...	Thanks, lady.
Twenty-three?! People, for God's sake, join a gym.	What Albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. He knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...
Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself.	Much more!
It will never happen again. Now come on, let's walk home.	That's not really what I was--
Can I ask you something? What is it that keeps you with me?	Absolutely.
And because you love me, I will not stop yo-yo dieting till I get it right.	It's because everything you love, you love so much.
Marge! Stop that crazy thing!	You finally reached emotional maturity. Unlike Bart.
I'm not spending my precious Saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than I ever had.	I've printed out our driving plan! If we work together, we can get Bart to his sports...Lisa to her music...and Maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today.
Moe, quick! Beer me before I answer the phone!	Homie! Are you dressed? You have soccer setup in twenty minutes! Homie?!
Hey, Marge. I'm supposed to help drive the kids? Oh, man, I wish I knew that sooner, but I just had a beer.	I need it now!
Woo hoo! Off the hook!	You're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? How much have you had?
Yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?	Looks like this is all me.
Hey Moe... I'll take care of the bar. You did me a favor today.	I can't close down the bar on a Saturday. That's when you guys can drink 'cause you're not workin' for three days.
Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together.	What the? When I was a young car I didn't sit around smilin' like I had nothin' better to do!
There's no guys! We haven't made any money.	I am woman, hear me pour! Oh yeah!
We don't look at you that way.	You can't mean that!
Good ol' Dae Ho. Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.	Hey, wait a minute! We can get you a job! There's an opening at the nuclear plant 'cause of that guy that defected to North Korea.
That's where all the problems are!	We are gonna search this place from top to bottom.
Look Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want.	Huh... no one was in there.
Well, that's the logic. Where's the affection?	Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg.
Plant-watering guy.	Smithers, what profit a man if he gain the world and lose his soul. Seriously. I need an amount. In round dollars.
All right.	Yes, yes, go ahead. And be careful with the Venus flytrap!
What do I do now?	They say you catch more flies with honey. I say with flytraps!
Oh, all right.	Just lean into it. It'll be over soon, one way or another.
Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school.	Now they won't even have lunch with me.
You know, Moe, you're a real jerk. I didn't mind so much when it came with beer.	Oh, now you gotta throw your grade school education in my face?!
Marge, which can makes me look cooler? The Drizzler or Mr. Drip?	I just lost my appetite.
Feminine?!	Homer Simpson. Working with those plants is great! It's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.
'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. The Dirty Dozen? All guys. Twelve Angry Men? Men! The X-Men? Mostly men.	"How come there's never a ""Take Your Son To Work Day?"""
Not my department.	Is it called the cooling tower because there's--
Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!	But what about the presentation? The eyes taste first, then lips, then palate, then the body's harshest critic, the colon.
Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?	Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the Princess -- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations.
Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?	Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?
Uh, just a second. Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project.	No. I want to go out. I am twenty-five years old.
Sorry, Marge. But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!	Lenny said you were babysitting. And if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out.
I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?	I want to go out, and see the America whose greatest cities I've only seen destroyed in movies.
All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.	Yes! I've dreamed of...
"He's called ""The Bachelor."""	So, all these concubines belong to this one tyrant?
All right, Princess. I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital F.	Please let me go out.
Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.	Eh, you gotta be mad at something.
And you gave it to him?	Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.
Eight million?	Now, guess how much of the twenty million I saw?
Get outta here!	Ze-ro.
She's gone!	If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!
Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!	And she trashed my bar! Oh no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little. Good for her.
Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.	Lost African princess, eh? Well, lucky for you, she just happens to be in the back of my cruiser.
What the?	Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.
Guys, thanks for bailing me out. But I still have a huge problem.	It's him!
Um, yeah, sure. Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee.	Uh, hello, Simpson. Just checking up. May I speak with the princess?
Moe Szyslak!	Just relax and enjoy the music.
This is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV!	Moe Szyslak!
Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?	And as for you, your punishment will be...
There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.	A woman has allowed you to sire her children?
And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve.	Majesty.
See what I mean? Always an argument.	Eight.
But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...	See what I mean? Always an argument.
...uh, because you want them to grow...	I am not convinced.
...and because you can't strangle a girl.	Still not convinced.
Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from LinkedIn.	God doesn't hear my prayers. If he did, I'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper.
Go, go make magic. You just go.	Yeah, so, uh, I'm going out to rehearse... the revue.
Revue...	Go, go make magic. You just go.
Oh boy oh boy.	Mmm! Now that's a marshmallow-y s'more-garita!
One AM lovin' and two AM steak? Night marriage rules! I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.	Oh boy oh boy.
What are the skits about?	Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue.
How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?	Uh... pop culture and current events.
Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one.	Both.
You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge. One hell of a show.	"Okay... There's a song about, um... how Democrats and Republicans can't get along. It's called ""Cats and Dogs."""
Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else.	Homie, Homie, I can finally tell you how we really got the money...
"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL"	This is all my fault.
CATS AND DOGS, SQUABBLE'S NEVER ENDING / EVEN WITH SO MUCH LEGISLATION PENDING!	"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL"
Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap...	Homie. How did you end up at the casino?
If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!	Mom's counting cards at the casino!
I'm comin' for ya baby!	If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!
Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?	I'm comin' for ya baby!
Do you know where she is?	This is your wife?
All right, as long as it's just questions.	"Uh, we'd like to ask you some questions in our ""beating room."""
Stole? How is counting cards stealing?	We just want the money your wife stole from us.
Is it even cheating?	Well, it's not really stealing.
I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?	No, but-- it's just not allowed.
I knew you had a vise! I knew it!	I can't take any more of this guy. Get the vise.
No deal!	You are free to leave as long as your faith-based card counting group never return to this or any other river or maritime casino.
No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.	But we don't need to come back. We saved the church.
I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. They're just playing the game by the rules!	No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.
On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?	Homie, after all this, do you still believe in God?
There's no time to be careful.	Ooo, careful, Homer.
We're late.	There's no time to be careful.
Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred.	Sorry, Excuse us. Pardon me...
Pardon my galoshes.	Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred.
Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours.	And now, presenting Lisa Simpson, as Tawanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas.
How many grades does this school have?	"The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol""."
Who shall I say is calling?	How many grades does this school have?
It's your sister.	Marge, please.
What? Why? Oh, yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?	Hello.
Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?	"""Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."""
Marge!	...Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays.
Marge, where's the extension cord?	The Simpsons.
Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.	Oh, for heavens sakes, Homer. It's in the utility drawer.
...Every year.	Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
A what!	A tattoo!
Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.	You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
Y'ello.	Homer!
Who's this?	Marge, please.
This is her sister, isn't it?	May I please speak to Marge?
Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. Marge! Turn on the juice!	Good one, Dad.
What do you think, kids?	Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. Marge! Turn on the juice!
What is it, Flanders?	Just hold your horses, son. Hey, hey, Simpson.
It's too bright. That Flanders, what a big show-off.	Oh. Neat-o.
Spill it, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money?	Go get your money.
Oh! Big jar this year.	You can look now.
Mm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm...	Get in the chair.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.	Mm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm...
Oh, thank God for the big jar.	One more thing: Merry Christmas.
Hey! What's with this?	Ow! Quit it!
It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone.	But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
Oh. I love you, Marge.	I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer.
Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping.	Homer, you tell me that all the time.
Marge, well, let me be honest with you.	But I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but...
Well... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year.	Yes...
Marge, Marge, Marge. Let's see. Oooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack... Oh! Only four ninety nine.	Well, sure, okay...
Oooh... pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look, a little squeak-toy. . It says it's for dogs, but she can't read...	Marge, Marge, Marge. Let's see. Oooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack... Oh! Only four ninety nine.
Hello, Flanders.	Ow. Oh, Simpson, it's you.
Well, let's see.	Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?
They're all yours.	This one's mine. And this one's mine. This one's mine... and this--
Gimme that!	Hey, Mr. Simpson. You dropped your pork chop.
So?	What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lumpa coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long.
Thanks, Moe.	So it's Christmas!
What's with the crazy getup, Barn?	Drinks all around!
Wow. Can I do that?	I got me a part-time job working as a Santa down at the mall.
What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts?	Do you like children?
Oh, I certainly do.	What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts?
Huh, when do we get paid?	What is it now, Simpson?
Dasher, Dancer...	Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho.
Prancer...	Um-hmm.
Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon.	Um-hmm.
And what would you like, little boy?	Sit down, Simpson.
Why you little eggheaded...!	You're not really Santa, tubby.
Oh, I knew that one, too.	No, no, Homer. If such an emergency arises, just tell them Santa's very busy this time of year and you're one of his helpers.
Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub.	Homer! Why are you seven hours late?
You both look well.	Fine.
Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.	Thank you.
And why is that?	Oh, it's Christmas? You wouldn't know it around here.
Well, I was just on my way out to get one.	Well, for one thing, there's no tree.
No!	Can we?
Uh-oh.	Hey, you. What do you think you're doing?
So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it?	Hey, hey! Come back here.
That's an ornament.	Why is there a birdhouse in it?
Ah, son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. Hey, I couldn't afford lunch. Gimme a bite of that donut.	And then I want some Robotoids... and then I want a Goop Monster... and then I want a great big, giant...
I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid.	I hope you feel better, Santa.
What's your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner?	Hey Santa, what's shaking?
I'm Jolly Old Saint Nick.	Here?
I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop, little boy. Cover for me, Elfie.	Homer!
Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything.	Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it was you.
Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do.	I'll say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low.
Hey, little ones, Santa's back. Ho! Ho!	Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do.
Arrgh! -- Damn it to...	Hey, little ones, Santa's back. Ho! Ho!
Ah, son. One day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. Receiving a big fat check for a job well done.	Arrgh! -- Damn it to...
Come on, son. Let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute!	Simpson, Homer? Here you go.
Yeah.	That's right. One hundred and twenty dollars gross, less social security --
But...	Less unemployment insurance --
Santa?	Less Santa training --
Wait a minute...	Less costume purchase --
But... but...	Less beard rental, less Christmas club.
Thirteen bucks. We can't get anything for thirteen bucks.	Come on, Dad. Let's go home.
What?	All right! Thirteen big ones. Springfield Downs, here I come.
"Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen!"	You heard me. I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Wanna come?
Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve.	"Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen!"
Uh-uh.	Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank.
Well, okay. Let's go.	Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us.
Who's Tiny Tim?	Well, okay. Let's go.
I can't believe I'm doing this.	WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE GOT A LOT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ALONG.
Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?	You know the tradition, son. Not till the eighth race.
What! That scrawny little bag of bones?	Number six. That's our lucky dog, right over there. He's won his last five races.
Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.	Come on, Dad. They're all scrawny little bags of bones.
What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?	It's a coincidence, Dad.
Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!	Ninety nine to one.
Don't you believe in me, son?	I got a bad feeling about this.
Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.	Uh...
That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.	Oh, go for it, Dad.
Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh.	Um-hm. Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off!	Come on, dog! Go, man! Go! Come on Santa's Little Helper! Run baby run!
Go! Go!	"And coming up on the left is ""Quadruped"", followed by Dog O' War and ""Fido""."
Come on, boy.	Go Santa's Little Helper!
I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.	It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.
Ah, forget it. Let's go.	I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
Find any winners, son?	Ah, forget it. Let's go.
Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh.	And don't come back!
But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...	Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?
-- a Simpson.	But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
All right, look everybody. I have a confession to make.	I'll pay! How much?
I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't --	This should be good.
It is?	This is the best gift of all, Homer.
Number eight. I mean, Santa's Little Helper.	What's his name?
Bart!	Like a light bulb!
Lisa!	Like Shine-ola!
I'm warning you two!	Like strip poker!
RUDOLPH WITH YOUR NOSE... OVER HERE... / SO YOU CAN GUIDE MY SLEIGH TODAY....	Take it, Homer!
Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?	Nurturing.
"Oh, wait! Here's a good one -- ""do""."	Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
Hey! No abbreviations!	"""Id."" Triple word score."
Hey, shut up, boy.	"As in, ""this game is stup-id."""
We got one?	"We could look this ""id"" thing up in the dictionary."
Get outta here.	"""Id. Along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."""
Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.	Twenty-two points. Plus triple word score. Plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.
I'll show you a big dumb balding ape!	And a short temper.
"That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. Hey, look at this! ""I am a weiner."" He sure is!"	He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard.
What have you done this time, boy?	Hello again, Principal Skinner.
Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?	I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
Oh, no. He can't mean that.	Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?
My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.	Oh, no. He can't mean that.
Oh.	That was the idea.
What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.	Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
A what?	"Oh, on the contrary. I have some very exciting news for all of us. This aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that young Bart here is what we call a ""gifted child""."
This lunkhead?	Bart?
Nine hundred and twelve?	No, no, we're quite certain. The child is not supposed to know his own I.Q., of course, but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt.
Oh.	Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's two hundred and sixteen.
Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show.	Sign me up, Doc.
Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?	I think we're all in a mood to celebrate.
How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.	No way.
Sorry, boy.	You're stifling my creativity, Dad.
Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.	Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?
It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this.	Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.
I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.	Homer!
Gotcha!	No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route.
Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.	Oh, no. Ties.
The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.	Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.
Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone.	Nurturing your brilliant brain, so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at eight.
So, how was it?	Yes, not very bright at all.
What?	Os-os.
Wow! What are you readin' there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?	That's backwards for so-so.
Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?	Wow! What are you readin' there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?
But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?	Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?
Jeez. No beer... no opera dogs...	There's no guy with peanuts, dear.
Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him.	Bart, stop fooling around. Homer, stop encouraging him.
Who's the lard butt?	Shhh!
P.U. When is this over?	Who are those people?
Is that one fat enough for you, son?	It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
Let's go get a burger.	Is that one fat enough for you, son?
Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball.	The what?
Well, I guess we don't have to do that.	Oh, no.
Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.	Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you.
Can you still see the ball, Bart?	Whoa! Strike two! Two and two!
Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat.	Don't worry, homeboy, you're not that fast.
So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?	Whoa! Yeah, strike three! You're outta there.
Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son.	I had a little accident in chemistry today.
Don't be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb.	Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son.
What is it, son?	Dad... I gotta tell you something... Hope you won't be too mad...
What?	I'm not a genius, Dad.
Why, you little -- !	I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.
You can't stay in there forever!	Oh, well.
March your butt right out here. Now!	I can try.
"But -- son, if you don't come out I can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."	No way, man!
Nothin's easy.	Hey, you guys look hot.
You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. Hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet?	Oh, okay. I thought you were puttin' him down.
You're right! I gotta get where the action is!	Come on, Simpson. If they wanted the kids to see you sitting around on your butt and stuffing your face they'd take them on a tour of your house.
Comin' through.	You're right! I gotta get where the action is!
Oh, hi, boy!	Woo! Woo! I'm up here!
But, sir, I --	I might have known it was you, Simpson.
Those perfectionists? Forget it.	Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.	How 'bout this: Supervising Technician at the toxic waste dump.
You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come.	Yeah, go for it, Dad.
I'm just a Technical Supervisor who cared too much.	Don't give up, Dad.
You'll get that punk someday, Moe.	Wait a minute. Listen, to me you lousy bum! When I get a hold of you you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half!
Moe, I think I'll have another -- -- Whoops. Moe, I'm a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?	Ahh, I don't know. He's tough to catch. He keeps changing his name.
Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.	No, sorry.
Oh.	I don't think you're ever going to get another job and be able to pay me back.
I'm fine. I'm just thinking.	Are you all right, Homer?
You think you can still do that kind of work?	Well, I've been thinking, too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted.
Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.	YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT WONDERFUL DUFF / DUFF BEER.
There must be some beer here somewhere... Ah, maybe in here.	Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.
Damn!	There must be some beer here somewhere... Ah, maybe in here.
I need money!	Damn!
Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure...	I need money!
Not even close.	Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure...
"""Dear Family: I am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Warmest regards, Love Homer J. Simpson."""	Not even close.
Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going!	Almost there.
Well, live and learn.	Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going!
Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign.	Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you.
Wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley	Cool, man!
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --	Oh, yeah?
I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --	Simpson, get to the point!
Wow. They listened to me.	Approved. Meeting adjourned. Coffee and maple logs in the lobby.
Hey, if they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken.	You did it, Homer.
Proud. Proud of what?	Oh, Homer. I am so proud of you.
Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.	Well, everything. Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road.
I'm talking about that!	What, Dad?
What did you say, son?	Gee, Dad's a hero.
That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.	Nothin'.
Thank you.	Homer! Homer!
Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur.	Yeah!
Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!	I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
Privately?	Burns wants to talk to you, privately.
Stay here, I'll be right back.	Yes.
Same here.	Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.
Sorry, no can do!	Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.	Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
Hey! What's the problem here?	Yeah!
Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I...	Hey! What's the problem here?
Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.	Simpson! Time's up!
What?	Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --	Go, Dad!
Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back.	Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --
I can't do it, Mr. Burns.	Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back.
Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.	You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.	You've got the job. Now get to work.
Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us.	I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.	Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us.
But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!	...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.	Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!
You were? Aw, well go ahead.	We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
Look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.	No I don't!
Mmmm! Marshmallow!	Look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.
I'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can, Marge. I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic.	Homer!
"Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead""."	Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once.
There it is, kids... Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on earth.	"Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead""."
Okay, now look. My boss is gonna be at this picnic, so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect.	There it is, kids... Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on earth.
Afternoon, Mr. Burns.	Excellent!
Simpson, Homer.	Ah... Hello, there, uh... uh...
Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts.	Bart.
Why you, listen to me you...	Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.
No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.	Trouble, Simpson?
Now, remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.	No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.
Be normal! Be normal!	Hey Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!
Bart!	Hey, isn't that your boy there, torturing the swans?
Bart! Lisa! Maggie!	You're right. There.
Where are you, kids?	Bart! Lisa! Maggie!
Gotcha!	Ooops!
Marge! Knock it off!	Whoa careful, Dad. Blow a gasket and you lose your job.
Is it used?	Marge! Knock it off!
You remember the rules from last year?	"Now hear this! The father-son sack race will begin in five minutes on the north lawn. Participation is mandatory	 repeat, mandatory. That is all."
Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!	Man, this is pathetic. I'm goin' for it.
Marge, I need you.	Hey brother, pour the wine.
Snap out of it, Marge. You've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!	Hey Homie. Did you try the punch?
Well, you picked a perfect time to start.	Well, I'm not much of a drinker...
Wahhhhhhhhh!	"Musicians, cease that infernal tutlitating. ""Thank you all..."" ""...for coming."""
Marge!	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Sorry. Sorry.
Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.	Get that man's name. I predict big things for him down at the power plant.
Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss.	Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid!
Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can go home and act normal again.	Fabulous observation, sir. Just fabulous.
"Oh come on. That cornball routine. ""I love you, Daddy."" Give me a break."	What do you mean?
Why?	I pity you.
Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.	Hey!
Yes.	Happy, Dad?
No. We're going to say grace first.	Good. Commence shovelling.
No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?	Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub.
No! I'm not done yet.	Amen. Let's eat.
I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.	But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the Man upstairs?
You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me.	The sad truth is all families are like us.
Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling...	You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me.
Yahhhhhhhh!	Look, napkins.
Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind Door Number Two.	Yahhhhhhhh!
I wish I could hear what they're saying.	They're having a conversation. They actually enjoy talking to each other.
Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.	Where's he going?
It's worse than you think. I just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.	Whoa, look at this place. What a dump.
No, no. I want to be alone with my thought.	Are you coming in, Homer?
Another beer, Moe.	The fans are getting just a little bit anxious here folks...
I've got some wieners in my pocket.	Hey! What's gotten into Bobo?
"You know, Moe, my Mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, ""Homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, God bless her soul, she was really onto something."	No.
You can't talk that way about my kids. Or, at least two of them.	Don't blame yourself, Homer. You got dealt a bad hand. You got crummy little kids that nobody can control.
Why, you... Here's five you haven't met.	Why? You got two I haven't met?
Huh... what?	"All-Star Boxing is brought to you by ""Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center""."
When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!	Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. 1-800-555-HUGS. Why don't you call... Right now?
All right, time for a family meeting!	When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!
Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.	Why can't we have a meeting when you're watching TV?
Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference.	The fat guy on TV?
Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars.	Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?
Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund.	But we don't have that kind of money.
Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?	Oh, Homer.
That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?	...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.
Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice.	I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.
Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here.	Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?
Would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely Motorola?	Afternoon, Simpson. So what can I do for you?
Ready as she'll ever be!	Is it cable-ready?
Hey, no pain, no gain.	All our money, the college funds, the TV. Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.
Cash, of course. I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. Two hundred and fifty big ones.	. Will you be paying by cash or check?
Bart!	If you really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where our TV used to be.
Lisa!	We would if we had one.
Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.	Homer, what have you got for us? Homer?
Good idea.	Whoa! Okay, you want to kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.
Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?	Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath.
Unortho what?	Don't be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.
Arrrgh!	Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you, for a very important reason, i.e. you are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--
Why you...	Just testing.
Oh, yes, doctor.	You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer?
Arrrgh!	Arrrgh!
Arrrgh!	Excellent, excellent. Perhaps this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo.
Arrrgh!	Arrrgh!
Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!	No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, you've just got to go.
Wow! Five hundred smackers!	five hundred. Here! Just go, and never tell anyone you were here.
That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!	Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?
Do I smell cupcakes?	Oh, Homer... we love you.
Oooo, Do I ever!	Do I smell cupcakes?
Ah. Say no more.	Uh-uh, Homer. Lisa's making these for her teacher.
No.	Keep your greasy mitts outta there.
Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.	Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser...
Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little.	Huh?
Surely, Lisa. You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there.	I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher.
Yeah, right, Lis. It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and...	Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard.
Yeah, and I got the day off from work.	Thanks, Bart. We got the day off from school for this.
But what's a day off from work when I'm never gonna see my beloved son again. Oh, Bart. Oh, Bart.	Homer!
Tough day at school, boy?	Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won.	Let's just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something.	I'm gonna miss you, big guy.
Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears.	Dad... I need help... Please...
So, what's the problem, son?	Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears.
Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.	A bully?!
What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.	I guess I could do that.
The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?	What on earth are you talking about, Homer?
Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh.	What do you mean, Mom?
Aw, Marge.	That's why he lashes out at the world.
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy.	So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.
No, no! Not like that! Like this!	Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.	No, no! Not like that! Like this!
Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.	You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?
So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded...	Amen.
And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.	Yeah!
And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.	Gotcha.
Awright, you kids, keep it down! Am I making myself... ?	This one. Artillery...commence saturation bombing.
You, up in the tree! The tall gray­ haired kid! Get your butt down here right now!	I got 'im.
What about you, boy?	Wow, sounds good to me. Okay. I'll sign.
Cupcakes.	Oh, boy!
Not now, Marge.	What?
Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa!	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool, gory pictures. Well, good night, everybody. Peace, man.
Wha' th--	Sorry, Dad. Women and children first.
The den! Great idea!	Did you check the den?
Do you know where my keys are?	Warm... no, cold... colder... Ice cold.
Rumpus room. Great idea!	Did you try the rumpus room?
Bart!	Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to keep him...
All right. Hey, hey!	Oh yeah!
Come on, come on. Let's go.	Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous. Now, let's see some enthusiasm! Play ball!
Must you do this every time?	In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout...
Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!	And Homer is down! Three seconds, folks -- a new record!
Okay. Here we go.	Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!
Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!	Yo, chump, you back again?
Ohhh... get out of the corner!	Homer?
What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.	But they sent a note from school.
Lisa?	Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa.
"""Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" Well, she doesn't look sad. I don't see any tears in her eyes."	Lisa?
"Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like ""my stomach hurts"" or ""I'm going crazy"". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?"	It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand.
Well... eh... er...eh...	I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?
Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee!	Well... eh... er...eh...
Thanks for knowing I mean well.	Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well.
You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!	Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.
In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!	Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong.
No.	Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.	Exactly, come to the one you love.
I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!	Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.
Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?	I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!
Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy.	I was just playing the blues... ...Dad.
Let's hear it.	No, that's okay, Dad. I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.	Let's hear it.
What th...	Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on. Because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile.
No, Bart, no.	I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic.
You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?	Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool.
Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing.	Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman.
Oh, no, Marge!	Fire officials said the two-alarm blaze took them more than an hour to get under control.
Marge, are you all right?	Oh, no, Marge!
Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!	No, I'm very upset.
Oh. Me, too.	I'm upset about Lisa.
Bart!	Me three. What are we talking about?
Gimme some quarters. I'm doing my laundry.	Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go.
Where's the video boxing?	Yeah, right.
Hey, that kid's pretty good.	It's over there in the corner, but if I were you, I really would use those quarters for laundry.
No, me! No, Me!	Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?	No, me! No, Me!
Aw, come on.	I don't think so.
You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!	I'll tell you what, I'll do it if you bark like a dog.
That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight.	Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man.
Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.	And you! A man of your age! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.	I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man.
Kid, tonight's not your night.	Whoa!
Oh! Oh! Block it.	All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Uh-oh. You missed me.	Wha' the...
Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.	Uh-oh. You missed me.
Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.	Boys, I'd like your attention, please.
Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right.	Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.
Oh, noooo!	Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right.
My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close.	Oh, noooo!
What?	"""I got this bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo."""
Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses.	No.
Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?	Wow, man! What an RV!
A satellite dish!	It's got everything! Microwave, dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer, and... see up there on the roof?
But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do.	Yes indeedilly-doodily.
Oooh! Credit.	Simple, Simpson. Credit.
I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?	We're just browsing, thank you.
Where is it?	Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth.
Does it have a deep fryer?	I'm not sure that we can afford...
Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.	This is better than our house!
Hey, how much is it?	It all seems so expensive...
Yeah, how much is it?	You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you?
You do?	Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face.
No.	Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you?
Is that a good siren? Am I approved?	I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.
Oh.	You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says.
Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.	It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.
How much do you want for it?	Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon.
I swear it Bob.	This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this.
Yeah!	This is you and me?
On my honor.	In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window?
Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?	Three-fifty a month.
Yeah!	Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there?
No.	He's buying this. Did you know that?
All right. All right! I'll take it.	Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not?
Hey Flanders! Look what I got!	Best decision you're ever gonna make. You're gonna... This is gonna change your life.
Jealous. Everybody ready?	Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun.
that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!	I hate this. I don't want to go.
Bart!	Dad's feet.
Lisa!	You win, Bart.
I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.	Are we there yet, dad?
Pfft. Maps.	Homer, I'm telling you this is not the Interstate.
Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.	Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
Ah, come on. We're going back to nature.	My feet are getting wet!
What do you think? Should we stop here?	We all are, dear. Your father says there's nothing to worry about.
All righty.	Yes!!!
Well, here we are!	All righty.
Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One...	Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers.	The Simpsons have entered the forest.
Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this.	Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers.
Will somebody help her?	You mean like we just did?
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!	Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?
Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.	Five finger discount, man.
What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.	Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.
Shut up!	I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.
Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter.	You are?
Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax.	It is?
That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods.	Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star.
Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.	There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?
And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.	It's a deal.
A rattler!	Right.
Run, you fool!	I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not...
When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense.	How do you know?
Bart? Where are you, Bart?	The boys certainly are taking a long time. I hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart!	Bart? Where are you, Bart?
Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldn't you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?	His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart!
What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.	Don't have a cow, Dad.
What? Oooh! Jungle Man!	I'm not the only one, Homeboy.
The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: Conceal your nakedness.	What? Oooh! Jungle Man!
Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town.	Yeah, man.
Ah food. Good thinking, son.	But dad, I'm so hungry. Can't we eat something first? I'm starving, man.
This young sapling ought to do the trick.	Ah food. Good thinking, son.
No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.	What are we going to do, hang ourselves?
Shhhh! Just watch.	No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.
Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!	Shhhh! Just watch.
Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him.	Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!
Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah!	Right, Dad.
G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight.	G-g-good night, D-dad.
No.	Are we there yet?
How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!	Are we ever going to be there?
Honey! Honey! We're saved!	How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!
Tangy.	How is it?
Wah-neh! Wah-neh!	Tangy.
Wah neh! Wah neh!	What?
Pleehhh! Hnnnn! Plem! Feh!	Oh. Water. Thattaway, man.
Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr!	Ahhhhhhh!
Plemk heh feh.	Bigfoot. The legendary half-man half-ape is no longer a legend. He's very very real. What you are about to see is unedited video footage taken earlier today in the hills three miles southwest of Tenderfoot Gorge.
Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food!	Arewethereyet Arewethereyet Arewethereyet?
Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles.	Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food!
Praise the grizzles son.	What do we do, Dad?
Maggie! Oh my little girl!	Nice grizzles.
Avenge me, son. Avenge my death.	Dad! Oh Dad!
Can I have some apple sauce?	Last weeks capture of bigfoot has turned into the scientific poser of the century. Although the creature was ultimately released, the question remains. Who was this Homer? Was it man or was it, in fact, the legendary missing link known as Bigfoot?
Oh, Marge. The guys at work are going to have a field day with this.	The glimmer of the eyes. What about the sloping apelike forehead?
Ooh, those stupid eggheads.	Gentlemen, gentlemen, fraulein, please. Zis much ve can agree upon: The specimen is either a below average human being or a brilliant beast.
You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh.	Oh, Homer... My brilliant beast.
They've got us cornered, boy. We'll never get away. Give me the head.	Kill him!
No!	No, dad. This whole thing was my fault. You run along.
Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob.	No!
We'll die together, like a father and son should.	Aw, dad.
Get him!	Oh, Bart. Now where's your father?
Oh no.	Phillips has broken free. He's at the 45, 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10.
No!	Touchdown.
No we don't. Try being objective for once in your... oooh!	A 64 yard run. We've got an upset in the making!
But you don't understand, Marge. I have fifty bucks riding on this game.	Let's go, Homer.
This isn't gambling, Marge. It's a lead pipe cinch.	Oh Homer, you promised me...
Oh no!	They're kicking off. Wolodarsky takes it to the five and -- Oh my! He fumbles.
Where is it. The game... where is it?	Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
Ah!	Where is it. The game... where is it?
Catch it! catch it!	All right Kogen's got Wolodarsky open in the end zone. He throws it.
All right!	It's complete. Touchdown!
Lazar who?	This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose from the dead.
Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!	Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer? ... Homer?
Maybe.	Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?
Make it, make it, make it, make it.	Now, they're lining up for this crucial kick. One final tick of the clock remains. If they win, it will cap an amazing comeback. But it's a 49 yard field goal into the wind.
Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.	The kick is up. It's got the distance. Holy toledo, it's good!
It's good! It's good! It's good!	Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
It's good to see you all in church.	It's good! It's good! It's good!
What? Oh yeah. You were great.	I was pleased you enjoyed it. I seem to have struck a cord with you today, Homer.
What was it about?	Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to.
Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?	Gambling.
What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?	Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?	Our teacher.
Marge. They're only space mutants.	No way, Jose.
I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?	Hey, Dad. Can I have five bucks?
Here you go, son. Share the wealth, that's what I always say.	Perish the thought.
Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?	Go ahead, Bart. Tell them. It's the head of Jebediah Springfield.
Sure, boy. What's on your mind?	Dad, can I talk to you about something?
I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world.	Well... I was wondering... how important is it to be popular?
You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?	So like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?
Are you?	No.
Then run along you little scamp. A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.	No.
"Oooh. Look at this one. ""The Hammer of Thor. It will send your pins to Valhalla."" Lisa?"	Well then come down for breakfast.
Ooooh, that's some ball.	Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.
Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?	It's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
I knew it all along.	Mom, Dad.
Yeah? Why you little...	Why, Bart, why?
Lay off the boy, Marge. He's a good kid. Quit givin' him the third degree.	Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that?
Well, maybe I am a little responsible.	Homer, did you have something to do with this?
C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities.	A little?
You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh.	C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities.
Good going, son. But remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice.	The feeling is more than mutual, sir.
Huh? Whuh?	Happy birthday!
My birthday?	Well, isn't this nice?
It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.	No!
Of course I know! Sure! You really thought I forgot, didn't you?	You don't even know your own wife's birthday?
Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.	Yeah, what'd you get?
Oh, no. Come on, come on! Open up!	Umm-hmm.
Ah... no.	Good morning, consumers. The Springfield Mall is now open for your spending needs.
Too salty...	Ah... no.
Ummm, nah...	Too salty...
Hmmm. Nah, too corny...	Ummm, nah...
Too exciting.	Hmmm. Nah, too corny...
Hmmmm!	I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
Be right there.	Homer?
Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers.	Homer, we're having dinner tonight at the Singing Sirloin.
Fair enough.	And the kids.
What's that, Patty?	Someone who eats with his mouth shut.
Bart!	What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it.
Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.	Oh, brother.
Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?	HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! / HAPPY THIRTY-FOURTH BIRTHDAY, MRS. HOMER SIMPSON... / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOO!
Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.	Well, it's hard for me to judge since I've never bowled in my life.
You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now.	Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.
What? No...	You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me.
I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?	The holes were drilled for your fingers.
Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back.	You never intended for me to use that ball.
So you'd know it's from me!	You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.
What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.	Hmmm. I'll just use my ball.
Well... you're welcome.	I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer.
Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings.	We have already begun.
Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this?	Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us.
Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.	My compliments to the delivery boy.
Eat, mm-hm.	Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.
Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in.	Eat, mm-hm.
All right, we're clean. Now we'll... put Maggie to bed.	Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in.
Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?	Homer... Homer.
Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing.	It's a very challenging hobby.
Oh? You're going back?	Umm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
Uh, no, I don't mind.	Well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?
'Night.	Good night, Homer.
Marge?	Oh! Oh! Well, all right.
Nothing.	What, Homer?
For Marge?	It's okay indeed.
Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.	Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?
Oh, sorry... ouch!	Dad, you didn't even say ouch.
I gave you advice? Get outta here.	Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.
Hmm. Good advice.	Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse.
Marge, may I speak to you?	Hmm. Good advice.
You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...Goodbye, my wife.	Sure.
Starving.	Ain't you hungry, Homer?
How can I eat it? She made it. It's all I have left.	Then why aren't you eating your sandwich?
Marge!	Domestic situation.
What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?	Marge!
Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.	Hey, what'll I tell the boss?
Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.	So how was the office birthday party?
Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.	Does this girl like him?
Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.	Homer!
Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.	Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.
Oh no! Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. I'm a whale. Why was I was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer.	Wow! Cool, man!
Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.	Don't strain yourself, dear.
No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.	Homer, is this some kind of stag party?
No, my supervisor.	Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your assistant?
Hey, what is this? The Spanish Exposition?	Didn't he used to be your assistant?
Bart! What are you doing?	...'cause I got a lotta spyin' to do.
Where am I... the Planet Cornball?	"And just as I was asking myself, ""Where did my seven-year-old boy get the money for a Father's Day present?"", I opened the box, and inside was little Eugene's baseball glove. He had given me the one thing that mattered most to him in the whole world. And Eugene, when I see you, the one thing that matters most to me in the whole world, married tomorrow, I'm going to know just how you felt that day."
Oooh... entertainment.	Hey don't worry. Things are gonna pick up once the... entertainment gets here.
Hey, shut up!	Hey, try and keep it down guys, okay?
Ooh, look at him squirm.	How do I tell you this, my boy? We're in hell.
I'm sorry, I don't usually laugh like this.	Go for it, Homer!
Oh, this is the most fun I've had in my whole life.	Wow, man.
One glazed and one scratch-and-win, please.	What are we laughing at?
Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.	You look familiar, sir. Are you on the television or something?
Oooh, Liberty bell! Another liberty bell! One more and I'm a millionaire. Come on, Liberty bell! Please, please, please please, please please. That purple fruit thing! Where were you yesterday?	Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
What are you on, pal?	Hey, hey! Lookin' good!
Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!	Hey, mister! Doo doo doo doo doo, doo dee doo dee doo dee doo...
Man, you get a lot of nutcases in here.	Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!
I hear ya, buddy! Whew! Full moon!	Hey hey hey!
Hmmm... still got it!	I hear ya, buddy! Whew! Full moon!
I-it's meaningless, Marge. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir.	What is the meaning of this?
Your photo?	Hey, my photo!
Why you little --	Uh oh.
Look Marge... honey... baby doll... I...	I'm outta here.
What are you saying, Honey?	Homer, I don't even want to look at you right now.
But where will I sleep?	What are you saying, Honey?
Would a motel be okay?	My suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.
Aw, I knew you'd come to your...	Would a motel be okay?
Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture.	What's the matter, Homer? Hottest Ladies Night in months and you're not even checking out the action.
Motel, I guess.	So where you staying tonight, Homer?
Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on.	If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's an open beer in the fridge.
Barney!	Hello, Marge, you left your damn porch light on.
Don't listen to him, Marge, he's...	Who is this?
No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed.	Homer, yo-you're overwrought. Why don't you unwind a little bit? Party down the hall. You know this apartment complex caters to upscale young singles like me.
Oh no.	Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Report at once to Mr. Burns' office.
What do you mean, sir?	What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?
It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?	A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!
Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy.	Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.
I don't really know, sir.	Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.
Well... Uh... Wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir.	Simpson!
Anybody home?	Of course! It's simplicity itself! I won't forget this, Simpson. Now return to your work, and tell no one of what transpired here.
How's your Mom?	Welcome back, Dad.
Oh, thanks, boy.	Yeah, good luck, man.
Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer.	Oh, thanks, boy.
Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.	Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer.
Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.	Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.
Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.	Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.
Oh, he does not!	I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you.
So what should I do, Marge?	Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer.
Okay. Your wish is my command, my little...	Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.
You see, I'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects.	Oooo.
Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?	Just let me say that it is an honor to have Springfield's number-one swinger with us to--
Marge. Marge. We're gonna try one more place. The Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor!	Nahhh. Try the Club Mud.
There she is! Hey, Princess! It's me, the guy from the snap shot!	Marge. Marge. We're gonna try one more place. The Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor!
Oooo.	Oh. Oh, hi.
Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.	Places, ladies! Take your places! Can I get just a little cooperation. It's showtime!
I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too.	Uh-huh.
Could you tell him a little about yourself?	Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Thank you very much ma'am. We'll be out of your...	Well, um... my real name's Shawna Tifton, my pet peeve is rude people. And my turn ons include silk sheets and a warm fire place.
Oh no.	Get out of my cage! My boss will freak out.
Ahhhhhh!	OH, I COULD LOVE A MILLION GIRLS/ EVERY GIRL IN BETWEEN/ YEAH, I COULD LOVE A CHINESE GIRL AN ESKIMO OR FIN...
ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.	Mister Mistro... OH, I COULD LOVE A MILLION GIRLS/ EVERY GIRL IN BETWEEN/ YEAH, I COULD LOVE A CHINESE GIRL AN ESKIMO OR FIN/ I COULD DIG A DEUCHLAND CHICK A GIRL WITH GOLDEN CURL/ IN FACT I THINK THAT WE COULD LOVE...
Hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... Da da da da da.	ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.
Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music... Quiet please... I have something to say. Quiet!	Way to go dad!
"Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there	 to all the boys	 to all the men	 to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?"	Oh, he's sunk even lower!
Marge!	Homer!
Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess.	Hi, little fella. Got some nice juicy flies for ya.
I told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--	Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess.
My back! There goes my back again!	I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you.
Oh, Maggie. My poor back.	Go get help, boy.
The boy. Bring me the boy.	Homer! What happened?
Oh Marge! I still hurt! Marge! Marge!	Mother!
Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?	Oh, Homer. How many times do I have to fluff your pillow?
Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.	Well... okay.
And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup.	I know how you like 'em, Homer.
Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me.	Homer, Principal Skinner's here.
That old gag.	Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory.
Hear him out, Marge.	Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country?
Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months.	Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away.
Yeah, but what about Bart?	Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks.
Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?	I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
You mean all white with pink eyes?	Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian.
He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.	France? Wow.
Bon voyage, boy.	Way to go!
I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.	I know I'm going and you're not.
Goodbye, Bart.	Mmm-hmm. Well, come along.
Be good.	'Bye. We miss you.
You gotta be kiddin'. The lek?	You know, in Albania the unit of currency is called the lek.
Give me the old stars and stripes.	And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
Political what?	And the main export is furious political thought.
Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he?	And this must be Lisa and Maggie... and you must be my new father, Homer.
Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.	Can, too.
Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.	Oh. Okay.
Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her.	Lisa!
Just kidding.	Homer!
Nice and cozy, Adil?	You leave Maurice alone. The floor is good enough for you. You go to sleep there.
Look, Adil. You can call me Dad.	Yes, thank you, Father.
Aww. You called me dad.	All right, Dad.
You want to see where I work?	Dad, do you think I could come visit you at the nuclear power plant?
None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.	Oh, yes, very much.
Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet.	Then I can go?
See these? American donuts. Glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. Now how's that for freedom of choice?	Very good. Now do it a million times.
Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.	Dad, do you think I might see your plutonium isolation module?
Hey, Lenny. Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?	Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.
Sector Twelve?	Yeah, over in Sector Twelve.
Oh, that Sector Twelve.	Third floor by the candy machines.
Come along, Adil.	Oh, that Sector Twelve.
You little shutterbug.	Ungrateful swine! We give you food, we give you shelter, and this is how you repay us.
Cheese!	You little shutterbug.
Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that.	You sure have taken a shine to little Adil.
Okay, okay. I love Bart. Well...	Well, okay, I will. If you admit you love Bart.
Well?	What?
Darn tootin'.	Oh... Adil's a very sweet boy.
Honey, I'm home.	Mon sauveteur! Vous aurez toujours une place dans mon coeur!
Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to.	Hello, Homer. What's that?
Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out.	Oh, my.
I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?	Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out.
Oooo.	Well, sir... Well, sir, we've been on the trail of a spy transmitting highly confidential information to an unfriendly nation.
Wow!	Mmm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point.
Aw!	That's all I can tell you.
Hmmm.	"All right. Well, the name of his country starts with the letter ""A""."
Gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this.	Time's up, Sparrow. We're coming in after you.
Adil! Oh... there you are.	The Sparrow!
Ouch! Watch it! Hey. Ow, Ouch!	Get him!
So, he's going to prison?	Au revoir, suckers.
Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted.	Goodbye Adil. Have a nice trip.
He needs me. Hey, boy.	Hey, where's the big guy?
Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle.	Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us.
Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French.	My father. What a buffoon.
Y'ello.	If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time.
Oooh, premium -- wait a minute. Why?	Hello, Homie. I was hoping you could pick up a half gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work.
How you doin', Apu?	Hello, steady customer. How are you this evening, sir?
Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... New flavor! Triple chocolate!	How you doin', Apu?
Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.	Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... New flavor! Triple chocolate!
"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""	What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
Sorry, pal...	Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy....
And he had a big nose.	Aye carumba!
No, bigger. And big red hair that came out to... yeah, yeah like that.	And he had a big nose.
Yeah. Wait a minute. It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero... Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!	Well, it is a simple charcoal rendering, but is this the man?
Well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed...	Hey, hey. What's going on here?
Yes, sir.	Ready, Mr. Simpson?
Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty.	So, Simpson. Which one is it?
Oh, definitely number... Heh heh...	No, no! Which one is the robber?
Four.	Simpson!
I'm home everybody.	Hmmm, very... thorough.
Oh fantastic. Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when... Oooh oooh, ooh, the news.	You missed the whole slide show, Homer.
Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?	The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message.
He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?	Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?
"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""	And just in... actual footage of the crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.
Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there... the clown's G-I-L-L -T-Y.	I know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? Maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along.
Sorry, son. You'll understand one day.	-- with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products. This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers -- Krusty's near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986.
Yes, sir.	Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats?
Yes, I do.	Hmmm hmmm. Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today?
Okay.	Fine, would you point him out to us?
No, I'm not. I'm hopping on the bandwagon. Now come on, son, get with the winning team.	But Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality.
Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.	It better not, you dimwit.
Ahhhh!	Now just a darn...
Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os.	Marge. She's thirty-four, and trapped in a loveless sham of a marriage.
Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.	Hey, isn't that your wife, Homer?
I hope you do find that punk someday, Moe. Fill 'er up.	Wait a minute... Listen, you little yellow-belly rat jackass, if I ever find out who you are, I'll kill ya!
Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.	Is everything okay, Homer? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, a hunka beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs and you're outta here.
You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.	Hey, you can level with me. You got a domestic situation?
What?	Homer?
What? Hey, Barney, am I a pig?	Marge is right. You are a pig. You can ask anyone in this bar.
Oh, no.	You're no more of a pig than I am.
Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.	See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
I read you loud and clear.	I'm not done. After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift.
Uh... I'd like some flowers.	Yeah, who'd possibly be late on meat loaf night?
Uh, you know, pretty ones. Like that.	What kind of flowers?
One, please.	Well, we have some beautiful long stemmed roses. They're fifty-five dollars a dozen.
Marge, I uh... love you. Marge, honey, I love you. Ohhh... Marge, I love you, baby. Hmm, Marge, sweetie, hooney, honey... Aah, this'll never work.	If he doesn't start loving, you're leaving... leaving... leaving...
I love you, Marjorie.	Marge, I uh... love you. Marge, honey, I love you. Ohhh... Marge, I love you, baby. Hmm, Marge, sweetie, hooney, honey... Aah, this'll never work.
...and I've made reservations at the Chez Paree.	Oliver Klozoff! Call for Oliver Klozoff.
It matters not, mon frere. And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Off Ramp Inn.	But, Homer, it's so expensive.
Oops.	Oh, oh, Homer. I feel giddy. Wait, what about a babysitter?
Hello, this is Mr... Sampson.	Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting Service.
No. I said Sampson, not Simpson.	Did your wife just call a second ago?
Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family.	Thank God. Those Simpsons. What a bunch of savages. Especially that big ape father.
BA, BA / BA, BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA / BA, BA BA!	Like an angel.
BA, BA / BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA...	BA, BA / BA, BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA / BA, BA BA!
You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man.	Work that body, Homer.
Son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo.	Not if I can help it.
Out, boy, out.	You don't have a clue, do you, Dad?
Smooth as a baby's behind.	What a grump.
I think you're right, dumplin'.	Precious? I think I hear the doorbell.
BART, GET THE DOOR!	I think you're right, dumplin'.
Well, don't just stand there, boy. Help Miss Botz with her suitcases.	Yes. I am Ms. Botz.
Bye kids. Watch out for the boy.	Oh, the Elves, the Elves!
They all look so tasty. But I think I'll eat this one right there.	I said, you're gonna watch this tape. And you're gonna do what I say, or I'm gonna to do something to you. And I don't know what that is, because everybody has always done what I say.
Why?	Why don't you pick one that's a little more frisky, sir?
Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes.	Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster.
Oui, oui. After you. And I'll be seeing you later.	Excellent choice, sir. May I lead you to your table?
Because I'm so carefree?	Homer, you look just like a little boy.
More champagne?	No. Because you're wearing a bib.
Ooops. Time for a fill-up. Garçon! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.	More champagne?
You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating.	The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living room, while the bandit roamed through the house at will, stealing the valuable objects it took the family a lifetime to shop for.
Don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.	One eight hundred you snitch, no, you... squeal...
No problemo. We'll just get off at the next exit.	Oh, there it... went.
Come on, Marge. Let me carry you over the threshold.	I'm calling to report the Babysitter Bandit. She's in our house right --
Sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it.	Okay, but watch out. Don't slam my head like last time.
Ooh, your blue thing with the things?	Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
Well, shake a leg, Mama.	You'll see.
Whoa!	Oh, Homer.
Mmmm.	Maggie... Maggie...
So?	Homer, wake up. There's no answer at home.
All right. I suppose my work here is done.	So, I'm worried. I think we should go home.
I don't like the looks of this.	How come all the lights are on?
Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?	I don't like the looks of this.
We're so sorry, we're so sorry.	Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now?
Oh, these things are heavy.	I can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. No, no, triple.	Oh, these things are heavy.
Sure.	Mr. Sampson, can I give you a bit of advice?
Ain't that the truth. You know, one time he --	Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.
Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --	This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den.
The what?	Excuse me, sir, are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted the escape of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?
Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle.	The Babysitter Bandit.
Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.	Awww, Homer.
Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.	Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.
Yeah. Yeah!	Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right.
Honey, can we make up again?	Yeah. Yeah!
Eww, I hate that icky soup skin.	Soup's on! Hurry up, or it'll get that icky skin on the top.
Mmmm. Marge, Could you get me another beer, please?	Okay, right after dinner, it's down to business.
Sure I do. I just want to have a beer while I'm caring. Marge...	He doesn't care, Mom.
What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper.	Well, okay. I got an A on my vocabulary test.
I'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. Well as long as I'm here, I might as well kill two birds with one stone.	What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper.
Look at those funny little whiskers. Oooo! That reminds me. It's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy.	What's the big idea? You covered up my paper.
"Oooh, ""Gorilla, The Conqueror."" The granddaddy of them all."	No, Dad, I should really... Whoop!
It's so unfair... just because he's different.	Ah well, maybe just one more hour.
Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em.	Well, time to hit the books.
Psst... Marge. Come take a look at this.	"All right, okay, let's take care of some business. ""Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom. On September fifteenth, sixteen-twenty, Puritan separatists from the Church of England, some living in Holland, left Plymouth, England. Their destination was --"
Just a little dim, I guess.	Oh! The little tiger tries so hard. Why does he keep failing?
What?	Of course. Homer!?
I have hair!... I have hair!	Hey Milhouse, what did I miss in school today?
Hey, Dr. J.	Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Hmmm...	I think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure. As a result, Bart is an underachiever. And yet he seems to be... how should I put this...? Proud of it?
Hmmm huh.	Blah, blah, blah... blah, blah, blah, blah.
Hmmmm	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah ...
And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids.	No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade.
I have hair! Look! Look!	Hm, hey, Martin.
Whoo hoo! All right!	Oh now, don't forget the nuclear power plant, Bill. That's closed too.
Yeah!	Please please please please please please please. All right!
Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen.	So...
We're proud of you boy.	I passed! I passed! I passed! I passed! I got a D minus. I passed!... I got a D minus. I passed!... I got a D minus. I passed! I passed! I kissed the teacher. Peh, peh, peh peh.
Hitler.	Okay, the capital of North Dakota is named after what German ruler?
Hey, I'm still beating you, boy.	Hitler?
Okay. The colors of the Italian flag are red, white and what?	Hey, I'm still beating you, boy.
I was right.	Green.
Miracle breakthrough! There's been a miracle breakthrough?	I used to think that losing my hair was as inevitable as the tides. Then I found out about Dimoxinil, the new miracle breakthrough in hair regrowth.
Hair... hair... Just like everybody else.	For your free brochure, send five dollars to: Dimoxinil, 485 Hair Plaza, Hair City, Utah.
Marge, weren't you listening? This is a miracle breakthrough. Not one of these cheapo sucker deals.	You know, some women find bald men quite virile.
Great! Great! Great! How much? How much? How much?	Allow me to present the Dimoxinil Action Set in its entirety. A six month supply of the drug, the gravity boots, scalp massager and your tee shirt.
A thousand bucks. I can't afford that.	One thousand dollars.
A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!	Hmmm. Well, we do have a product which is more in your price range. However, I must assure you that any hair growth you experience while using it will be purely coincidental.
"So I say ""Forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!"", and I storm right outta there."	A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!
Out of tartar sauce.	Ah ha, that's telling him, Homer.
They call this a portion? Hey Lenny, are you gonna use all your tartar sauce? Dry fish sticks. This sucks.	Out of tartar sauce.
If I had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that.	Quit complaining, chrome-dome.
But it's a thousand bucks... Burns would can my butt in no time flat.	Homer, don't be a sap all of your life. Just fill out a few medical insurance forms creatively. Charge that Dimoxinil stuff to the company.
Nothing... well, that newsletter.	Yeah! Besides you pay money into the insurance fund every week. What do you ever get out of it?
You got me!	Exactly! Why should you get nothing while some guy who loses a finger hits the jackpot?
Uh, I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance?	You got me!
Good morning, Springfield! Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Winfield!	Look buddy, I don't know who put you up to this, but no insurance plan in this state covers something as frivolous as Dimoxinil.
Good morning, Moe's Tavern!	Why don't you get a haircut, you hippie?
Good morning, everybody!	Ah... it's the President!
Gimme the usual.	Homer Simpson! Why, why, why, you haven't been here I-in twenty years! Hey, you got rid of the sideburns.
Daddy's home, Sugar!	I don't want to think about it.
Ah, dinner with three beautiful women. I must be in heaven.	Homie, my sisters are here.
Well, your resume seems in order. Besides typing and stuff, do you have any other qualifications I should know about?	Attention Homer Simpson. You have been promoted. You are now an executive. Take three minutes to say goodbye to your former friends and report to room 503 for reassignment to a better life.
No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye.	I give great back rubs to harried executives. Here. Let me show you.
Hello?	No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye.
Oh Marge, every woman I i­n­t­e­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me.	Hello, Homie. How's my big important executive?
I'll call you back, Marge.	He sounds good. Hire him.
Yes, Mr. Smithers.	Simpson! M­e­eting in the board room tomorrow at two. Just sit there and keep your mouth shut. Got it?
He thinks he's so big.	Yes, Mr. Smithers.
Huh?	You don't belong here.
Who told you?	You don't belong here. You're a fraud and a phony and it's only a matter of time until they find you out.
I... I de...	You did! You told me with the way you slump your shoulders, the-the way you talk into your chest, the way you smother yourself in bargain basement lime-green polyester. I want you to say to yourself: I deserve this! I love it! I am nature's greatest miracle! Go ahead, say it.
I de...	Trust me, Homer.
I deserve this.	Take a step and say it.
I deserve this!	I deserve this.
I AM NATURE'S GREATEST MIRACLE!	SHOUT IT!
YOU GOT IT, BUDDY!	I'll need three weeks vacation and moving expenses.
Ooh. Beauty.	Let's go shopping.
Do any of these suits do that?	"A man's suit should make him feel like a prince. It should cry out to the world, ""Here I am! Don't judge me! Love me!"""
Ooh, I like this.	No!
Gotta run, Marge. Can't be late.	Mom and Dad have been smooching again.
What? Our anniversary? Are you sure?	Happy anniversary, Homer.
Hello?	Can't you see!
I love you, Karl -- Marge.	I love you, Homer.
Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.	You then! How would you improve the worker situation?
Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them.	Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?
Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out.	I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!
Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody.	Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!
The key!	Mr. Simpson, don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer! They've given you the key!
Sure thing, Mr. Burns.	But...
Can do, sir.	Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway.
Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?	Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?
Yea... eh... how about a pony?	An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
Uh, well okay, what the hey?	I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know.
Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?	With pleasure, sir.
What?	Oh, just thought I'd drop by to tell you that... you're fired.
You did?	Wait! Mr. Smithers, Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this.
Karl, you saved me. Why?	My reasons are my own.
Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say.	Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what I was born to do, what any good soldier would have done when a live grenade threatened his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt.
Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.	Just walk me to my car.
No.	Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella today?
Bart, what are you doing?	It's like, realsville, Daddy-o.
Why you little...	Uh-oh.
Ahhhh!	Uh-oh.
Boy must die.	Ahhhh!
Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary.	I love you, Dad.
I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?	Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --
Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?	Dear Mr. Simpson: I have taken the liberty of preparing your speech on the enclosed numbered three-by five cards. All the big words are spelled phon-et-ic-al-ly. God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir.
Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. Look at me!	I just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool.
What do you mean?	I guess I haven't taught you anything.
No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.	Don't you see? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key -- drying your boss's hands. You did it all! It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could, and you still can.
How do you know?	Oh no, you're not.
Karl.	Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool.
A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.	He is Homer Simpson, sir.
Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of...	He's crazy!
Five thousand two... I mean... Lots of money.	Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of...
Uh, why?	Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to.
I don't know... a hundred and two?	Simpson, how old do you think I am?
What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.	Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back.
Oh, better hurry up.	Now get out of here before I reconsider.
I've never been more awake in my life.	Homer, are you still awake?
Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald.	What's wrong?
And... and?! What about loving me?	Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it.
What?!	Oh, Homer, honey. Come here.
I'M EVERYTHING YOU NEED /	"Come here. ""YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /"

Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.	Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on T.V. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thanks for your attention.
Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.	Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
There you are, my man. And a dollar for yourself.	That's all of it. Sign here.
Huh? Well... it's all ours!	A buck! I'm glad there's a curse on this place.
Motivated seller, Marge.	I still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.	Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this.
Probably just the house settling.	What on earth was that?
I don't know.	Homer! What's this thing in the corner?
Ooh, a vortex.	It looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.
Catch.	Ooh, a vortex.
Hey! Pretty slick!	Catch.
Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.	Get... Out!!!
Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.	Evil!
Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here...	Children, get your coats. We're leaving this house right now.
Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!	I'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
It's got great high ceilings.	Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
Tell you what -- let's sleep on it. Okay?	It's got great high ceilings.
What could happen?	All right. But if anything happens...
They are all against me! They all must die!	Liiii-saaa! Liii-saaa! The butcher knife, Lisa.
Marge! Oh, Marge!	They are all against me! They all must die!
Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd sleep on it.	That does it. Children, get dressed. We're leaving.
An ancient Indian what...?	Man, this place has got everything!
Mr. Ploot? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. You didn't tell me it was built on an Indian burial ground. No you didn't! Well, that's not my recollection... Yeah! Well... all right, goodbye. He says he mentioned it five or six times.	An ancient Indian what...?
Aw, gee, Marge.	Let's go, children.
Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.	Homer...
Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!	Look at me. I've never been so angry. My hands are shaking.
Wow!	Hmmm. Life with the Simpsons. What choice do I have.
Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh.	Homer, all these flies.
That should just about do it. Man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection...	Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh.
The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.	Cool man!
Hey! Get a load of that spread.	Dinnertime.
Smothered pork chops.	Sloppy Joes!
The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce out here for these pork chops.	There's something not quite right about this.
What are you lookin' at, buddy?	The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce out here for these pork chops.
Oooh, thanks.	Your wife is quite a... dish.
Marge and I played that old game before we were married.	Get with the times, man.
Oooh, a feast.	Oh, we wouldn't want to spoil our appetite for... the great feast when we land on Rigel Four.
Tell us more about this feast.	Oh, you'll be at the feast. I have a feeling you'll be the guests of honor.
Marge, she's right.	If you don't believe me, look at this book I found.
Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody, but nobody eats the Simpsons.	Humans, you have stopped eating.
Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.	I beg your pardon.
Yeah, thanks Lisa.	Way to go, Lis.
Huh?	Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
'Tis some visitor,	As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
-- tapping at my chamber door -- Only this and nothing more.	I muttered,
Oh, Lenore.	-- sorrow for the lost Lenore --
Aag!	For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for evermore.
'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- This it is and nothing more.	"And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before	 So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating	"
Sir --	"Presently my soul grew stronger	 hesitating then no longer	"
"-- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore	 But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you."	-- said I --
Surely --	Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
"-- surely that is something at my window lattice	 Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --"	-- said I --
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --	"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he	 not a minute stopped or stayed he, But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -- Perched, and sat, and nothing more."
-- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!	I said --
Ouch! Censer..	Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some unseen censer,
Wretch --	Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
-- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!	I cried --
Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!	Nevermore.
Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!	I shrieked of starting,
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!	Nevermore.
Why you little --!	Nevermore.
Come back here now, Raven	Uh-oh.
Oh no, Marge. Come on, please.	I guess I'll have no trouble gettin' to sleep tonight.
Oh... oh, I hate Halloween.	Homer, I am not sleeping with the lights on. They're just children's stories. They can't hurt you.
Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.	Well leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --	Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.
So... Someone will punch in for me.	You're late for work, Homer.
I'll mutant you.	Keep those mutants comin', Homer.
Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. Why can't I ever get here on time?	I'll mutant you.
Uh, uh, just resting my eyes.	Yeah. Well that's always been like that.
Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.	Empty! Bah!!
Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me.	Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
Echo, echo...	Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me.
Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?	HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / THEY CALLED ME AL / IT WAS AL ALL THE TIME / HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / I'M YOUR PAL / BUDDY, CAN'T YOU SPARE A DIME.
Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?	Ah!
Uh... uh yes, sir.	Working late, Simpson?
Ooooh, cushy.	You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in.
Well, nobody's perfect.	They say we're contaminating the planet.
You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.	Why can't the government just get off our backs?
I bet you could afford it, though.	Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford.
Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.	I bet you could afford it, though.
Where are we going, sir?	Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.
If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?	To create a new and better world.
Well, he's got my vote.	If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?
Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.	Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.
Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.	I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.	That Burns is just what this state needs... young blood.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns Booster. Ow!	Homer... I'm a Bailey Booster.
Not yet, son. Not yet.	Is your boss Governor yet?
Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.	Well, I... I knew there would be sacrifices.
And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them.	What!
Come on, Marge.	Absolutely not!
Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this.	Huh uh. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.	Uh oh.
Marge! Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow.	Well I think the non-card question is a valid one.
Marge, get back in bed.	And finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him. But we must remind you, he hates being touched.
What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.	No, I'm just fine right here.
What's that got to do with it?	Well, I don't feel like snuggling.
But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.	I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
Huh?	Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it! All right! Good! That's it. That's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Goodnight.
Hey! Hello, handsome!	Well, what do we think?
Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns.	Hello, Homer. Marge, you look dazzling. Oh, and look, I've brought noodle kugel.
Are you all right, Mr. Burns?	Aaaah... kitty, kitty.
Bart, would you like to say grace?	Excellent.
"""You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"""	He's smokin'. He's smokin'.
I was only reading what the card...	Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.
Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns...	Homer... Homer... make them stop.
Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?	Uh oh. You're busted, Dad.
Hey, you did it!	Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them.
Aw, Barney.	So, Homer. What happened in Capitol City?
Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.	Come on, Homer. We're dyin' of curiosity.
"Well, okay. It all started on ""Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night,"" down at Springfield stadium."	C'mom, Homer.
You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.	Hey, get on the bus, dancin' Homer.
Sure, we get a nice mix here.	What? Aren't we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?
Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.	I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy.
What are you getting at?	I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer.
Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself.	Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.
Uh... Simp-sons, sir.	Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps.
What's the matter, boy?	Lousy, washed-up, broken-down... old tub of guts... who does he think he is anyway...
Wow! Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge.	"""Hmmm, Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26... How 'bout it? -- Flash."""
Whoa!	Hey, Dad, look, you're on JumboVision!
Hey everybody! How you doin'? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Heh...heh.	Whoa!
Examine my zipper? Why? Whoops!	Homer... Homer... X.Y.Z.
Thanks, everybody.	Examine my zipper? Why? Whoops!
"Hey, Burns! Hey, ""Rag Arm""!"	Oh, shut up.
Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!	Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend. You did get me something on an aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be surrounded by them.
Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks...	Here we are, sir.
Rub it in.	All this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.
Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns.	here! Duff Beer! that, Marge?
Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.	I suppose you want a beer?
Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?	Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat.
Good one, sir.	THE HITTER'S OFF HIS ROCKER / KISSING BETTY CROCKER!
LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER!	Oh well, I used to rile the late, great Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park.
Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name.	LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER!
Don't mind if I do.	Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?
All right, Burnsie.	Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave?
C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.	Big Bill McCloskey coming up. As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the post-game show.
What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!	My one game of the year... ruined by pathetic incompetence.
Your team needs you! C'mon!!!	What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!
As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.	Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?	"Excuse me... You, sir -- the dancing fella. I'm Antoine ""Tex"" O'Hara. I own the Isotopes. Would you be interested in becoming our official mascot?"
I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared.	M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
Well, I'm ready to punch in.	I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared.
Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.	Did the team ask you to dress like that, Homer?
For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me.	Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.
Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.	A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.
Oh yeah? And where might that be? Oh.	Hey, knock that off or I'll stick this bat where the sun don't shine.
"Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me ""Baby Elephant Walk"" with a little reggae kinda beat?"	Oh yeah? And where might that be? Oh.
"You wanted to see me, ""Tex""?"	Here's the pitch... swung on and missed -- strike three. 'Topes lose... 'Topes lose...'Topes lose...
Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.	Homer, now we both knew when you began doing this you weren't gonna be here forever...
Me? In the majors?	Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got the word -- You've been called up to Capital City.
"Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City ""Goofball""."	That's right.
I'll say!	Yeah, but he's getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night. Could be a big opportunity for you.
Because they might say no.	Why don't you talk it over with your family?
This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.	Because they might say no.
I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. Oooh.	This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.	I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.
Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.	Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?
You mean -- ?	Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts.
It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.	Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
That's right, Ned.	So, Simpson. You're really moving to Capital City?
Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... not.	Uh huh. And all this stuff is for sale, huh? You know, I-I-I... don't know how to say this, but, well...
... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!	Oh, shut up.
With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life.	... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!
Wow!	Wow!
Kids, look! Street crime!	"PEOPLE STOP AND SCREAM HELLO /,people stop and scream hello,5
5349,18,203,Tony Bennett: IN CAPITAL CITY..."
Wow! That's service!	"IT'S THE KIND OF PLACE THAT MAKES,its the kind of place that makes,7
5352,18,206,Tony Bennett: A BUM / FEEL LIKE A KING..."
The Duff Brewery!	...FOURTH STREET AND D!/ YEAH!/ ONCE YOU GET A WHIFF OF IT...YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO ROAM.
Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.	Awww. Come to bed, Homie.
We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.	Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.
Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me.	We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.
Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.	See you after the game, when you're a big star.
Wow.	Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
"Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City ""Goofball."""	Wow.
Wow, the fifth.	"The fifth inning will be yours. Everyone is settled in, they've had a coupla beers	 the game is official. It's a pretty important inning."
Right, Mr. Goofball.	It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper on the front of this thing, if you know what I mean.
Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk.	"Hey, call me plain ol' ""Goof"". So what exactly do you have planned for us?"
Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.	Throw at his head!
Oooh, red hots.	Red hots! Get your read hots here!
Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. Uh oh.	Ladies and gentlemen. Capital City's newest sensation, Dancin' Homer!
I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.	There he is!
But they didn't care.	I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.
It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.	I don't know.
The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.	These cornball antics may play in the sticks, but this is Capital City!
What a family.	Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.	What a family.
So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude.	My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention.	What a saga.
Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.	Tell it again, Homer.
Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.	I don't know. They just do.
H'lo, Flanders.	"""One o'clock -- still just a potato.,one oclock -- still just a potato,7
5433,19,6,""Ned Flanders: (PLEASANTLY) Hey there"
Who told? Marge! Beer me!	Doing a little yard work, huh?
Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?	Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif.
There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass.	Well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there.
Marge! Where's the Duff?	Well, you may be right!
Don't toy with me, woman.	Marge! Where's the Duff?
Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.	Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me.
Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!	Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.
Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years.	Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?	Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?
Well, beggars can't be choosy.	Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.
All right, knock it off!	Ah, kids can be a trial sometimes.
You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!	Uh, knock what off, Simpson?
I wouldn't stay on a bet!	Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand.
One for the road.	I wouldn't stay on a bet!
Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off...	Play it where it lays, Homer.
Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!	What exactly did he say?
Well... he...	Well, how did he say it?
No.	Was he angry?
Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!	Was he rude?
Oh, he's perfect now, is he?	Homer, I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor.
No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.	Well, he's not perfect, but he is very...
I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.	No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.
Flanders!	Dear Neighbor...
Dear neighbor... 	I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now.
You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom.	Dear neighbor... 
Wait! Wait! There's more...	You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom.
"""Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."""	I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?	I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go, boy.	And I'm studying for the Math Fair. If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.
Fore!	Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go, boy.
But I got it in the middle!	Heh, heh, heh heh...
That was just a practice shot, boy.	But I got it in the middle!
I know, I know. I can still make this for five. Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze.	Give up, Homeboy. There's a six-stroke limit.
Flanders! What are you doing here?	Hi, Simpson! Having fun?
That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.	All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there.
Luck.	Good shot, Toddsky!
Never mind!	Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six...
Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?	So, my little Bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?
Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.	Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good.
Come on, boy.	Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose.	But Dad, I've never won anything in my life.
Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.	You brought food...
No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through...	Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.
Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through.	No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through...
What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name.	Oh, man.
Come on, give it a name.	What?
Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name.	Mr. Putter.
Your putter's name is Charlene!	Mom.
It just is. That's why.	Why?
Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him.	It just is. That's why.
I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!	Who's Charlene?
And?	Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.
But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.	Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament.
Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.	Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?
I said NOW!	Let's try another one: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?
Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --	I can't believe it... You've actually found a practical use for geometry.
Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt.	Hey, Simpson.
"Ah, ""may the best man win"". The mating call of the loser."	Well, sir, may the best man win.
Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?	Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance.
That's right!	Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?
What, are you afraid to make a real bet?	All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!
How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.	You know, Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress.	All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!
Read that back to me, Marge.	You have yourself a bet, you jackaninny!
Oh man. Fine.	"Eh, eh, just a minute. ""Loser"" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
I'm game if you are, Flanders.	Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.
Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders...	Good gravy, what have I done?
Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try.	Dad!
Anybody can try! I want you to win!	Okay, I'll try.
Marge, give me your honest opinion. This? Or this?	Homer?!
Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!	Marge, give me your honest opinion. This? Or this?
See you downstairs, boy.	Dad!
Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...	See you downstairs, boy.
Oatmeal?	Oatmeal.
News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy.	Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win.	Thanks, man!
Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels.	Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
'Fraid not.	No, you will.
'Fraid not.	'Fraid so.
'Fraid not infinity.	'Fraid so.
Woo-hoo-hoo!	And the battle is well and truly joined!
"Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: ""If you lose, you're out of the family."""	It's okay, son. You can recover.
Ow.	Homer!
Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!	Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal.
I got it right here in writing.	What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.
The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.	I got it right here in writing.
It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.	But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too.
Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...	Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
Halftime, Marge, halftime.	Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
Oh my God! He's enjoying it!	Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days.
Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!	Bart, cut it out!
Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!	It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!
Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.	Uh-oh. Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose...
Bullwinkle.	Who the hell is that?
Underdog! Don't you know anything?	Who? Wait a minute, who's that?
Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce.	Well, I know it wouldn't hurt 'em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years.
I know, I will.	Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters.
See, Maggie? Those silver and blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're Daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. Understand?	Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?
Good to see ya. Well, gotta pick up my old man! 'Bye!	Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma.
Oh, I love those kids! They've got such a great attitude!	"And now, get set for our fabulous half-time show, featuring the well-groomed young go-getters of ""Hurray for Everything!"""
Come on, Dad. Let's get outta here.	Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me!
This place is depressing.	Slow down, boy. What's your hurry?
Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. Let's go.	Hey, I live here!
This thing's gonna be roaring any time now!	That's no way to lay a fire! Where's your kindling?
The hell with this.	Dinner! Dinner time, everybody! Dinner!
Holy moly! That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw.	Lisa! My goodness! That's very impressive!
Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!	Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...
All right, Bart that's it! Go to your room NOW!	You don't even care! You don't even care!
...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?	I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...
Don't worry, Marge'll fix everything.	Oh, why don't I go talk to her?
Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Little Helper. Come on... gimme that. Gimme that.	Uh-oh!... I mean, good!
Okay, out you go!	Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Little Helper. Come on... gimme that. Gimme that.
Yes, Dad.	Homer was never stubborn. He always folded instantly over anything. It was as if he had no will of his own. Isn't that true, Homer?
You know, his girlfriend is the weather lady.	Pompous, blow-dried, college boy!
What show is this?	It's Bart!
Hello, operator? Gimme the number for 911!	Oh, no! My sweet little Bart!
Will you forget the report! He's down at the rescue mission!	No, I'm comfortable with it.
Well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister.	Can you think of any reason he might have run away? Anything at all?
We can, and will!	Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves.
Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?	Children need discipline. You can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
Oh it's great to have you back, boy! We were afraid we'd lost you!	Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried!
Yeah, boy. Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness.	No, no, no! That won't do at all!
It's your fault I'm bald!	Now we can blame him for everything.
Damn, no spots.	But I only got up to go to the can.
You know Marge, we're great parents!	Apology accepted.
Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family one more crack at togetherness. Amen.	You know Marge, we're great parents!
Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match.	Oh, Bart, I hope you're not taking this seriously. Even a five-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet.
Hey, I don't see your name engraved on the bar stool.	Correction, was your seat.
Whoa.	Twenty tons and four stories of car-crunching, fire-breathing prehistoric insanity.
TRUCKASAUROUS!	Be there!
I have an announcement to make. As a family growth thing, Bart and I think we should all go to the Monster Truck Rally this Saturday.	TRUCKASAUROUS!
Uh... Monster Truck Rally, growth thing... No, I don't think so.	Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, cruel fate. Why do you mock me?	But Truckasaurous is one night only!
Eight o'clock, but what does it matter?	Now, come on, you two. What time does your little truck game start?
Marge, you're a genius.	Well, Lisa's recital starts at five o'clock. We could go to both.
Series?!	People let's have good assembly manners. People, people. Quiet down, now, please. Don't make me flick the lights on and off. Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen, parents and music lovers. Welcome to the first in a series of Saturday evening concerts.
Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long.	Tonight Sherbert's... ... uh, Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.
That was beautiful. Can we go now?	Remember, children, stay together. Five, six, seven, eight...
How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?	Sit down, Homer.
Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all.	Oh my, Lisa was wonderful. She certainly's come a long way with her fingering.
Come on, Flanders, he's not that bad.	My son... my son.
Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.	Homer, drive defensively.
Not now, Lisa.	Dad?
What?	Homer.
Where, where?	Truckasaurous!
Let the destruction begin! Hey, they forgot my corn dog.	Another barrier broken. Right on, sister!
Here you go, Bartasaurous.	Gimme some nachos, Homersaurous.
Oh I can't watch.	This is so cool.
Bart, Bart. We're home, son.	Ladies and gentlemen. The ten year old who's brave and bold. When he's not in class, he's risking his ass. The world's greatest daredevil, Bart Simpson.
Kids say such stupid things.	Dad, I want to be a daredevil.
Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im.	Oh, my little boy, .
Ewwww.	Better than all right, I got stitches.
Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?	Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless hours of top-notch entertainment.
Oh, hi, kids. Thanks.	Thank you. How 'bout a hand for these brave little animals?
You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.	What's the matter?
Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.	You're welcome, little pardner. On your way out, tell the nurse I'm ready for my sponge bath. Another fringe benefit. Nurse.
I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.	You can't.
He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead.	Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge.
Oh, that never works. He's a goner.	Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him.
Okay, okay. I'll try.	Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try.
Bart? Bart?	Okay, okay. I'll try.
Bart! What are you doing?	Bart? Bart?
You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?	Ah, nothing.
Look, I know I can't stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge.	Maybe.
I mean it, boy.	Aw, come on.
That's my boy.	Well, okay, Dad. I promise. I will not jump Springfield Gorge.
You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there.	How'd it go, Homer?
Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --	Look, there he is!
Why that little liar! I should... and I was gonna play pickle with him.	Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --
BART!	Why that little liar! I should... and I was gonna play pickle with him.
Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.	Hey, what gives?
Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.	What? Why?
Don't you think I know that?	But, Dad, you'll never make it.
Goodbye, son.	Don't you think I know that?
Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.	Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise.
I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --	I love you, Dad.
I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--	I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --
You think you've got guts, try raising my kids.	I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world.	A dash of rosemary... a smidgin of thyme... a pinch of marjoram...
Marge, I'm gonna build you a spice rack!	A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric... and a whisper of MSG.
It's no trouble. I've got a whole garageful of tools I never use.	You don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
Shut up, boy.	Hey, down in front!
I knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. Let's see now... ah, here it is. The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. Volume One. Spice Rack.	THEY FIGHT, THEY BITE / THEY FIGHT AND BITE AND FIGHT / FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT / BITE, BITE, BITE / THE ITCHY AND SCRATCHY SHOW.
Pick - up - a - ham - mer...	I knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. Let's see now... ah, here it is. The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. Volume One. Spice Rack.
Wowww....	Pick - up - a - ham - mer...
No, I can't. It's broken.	Hey, Dad. Can you move your head?
Keep her away from me, Marge! She's got that crazy look in her eyes again.	No, Maggie! Bad baby!
You heard me. I won't be in for the rest of the week. I told you. My baby beat me up. Oh, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. Wise guy.	Hey... That's just crazy enough to work.
Hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?	I wonder why Bart and Lisa are so late getting home from school?
Because why?	Because.
Because you said so, why?	Because I said so.
Oh. What are you doing?	Homer! I'm trying to work!
Heh, heh, heh.	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?	This is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers?
No.	... please try to tone down the psychotic violence...
Everybody's looking at us, Marge.	... and the horse I rode in on!?
Oh. Well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?	Well, that's what we want them to do, Homer.
I didn't know they still made TV dinners this bad.	How many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week?
There's peas in my fruit cobbler.	No.
Hey, tomorrow night, how about making some of your patented pork chops?	All right.
Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.	Hmmm, sure. Oh, dear. I can't. I've got three protest rallies tomorrow.
You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives.	Hmmm. Ah ha! I'm so funny.
Take that you dumb squirrel.	Don't do that! Don't do that! Hey! Don't DO that!
Where do they get their ideas?	Mmmmmmmph!
One thousand dollars.	It's an asphalt spreader! It's sixty- seven tools in one! How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?
Oh, sorry.	Don't answer yet...
I was watching that.	... because you also get...
... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie.	I think it sucks.
Sit down, boy!	So what did you kids do today?
Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you.	Sure.
Well, I always knew you'd change the world, for the better.	I didn't really expect things to change this much.
Marge, get the door.	... and if we have time, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.
Really? Great!	"""Smartline!"" With our local Emmy-award winning host, Kent Brockman."
Well, there he is... Michelangelo's Dave.	"Well... I guess that settles that. I'd like to alert our affiliates that we will be ending our show early tonight. Join us tomorrow when our topic will be, ""Religion: Which is the One True Faith?"""
Oh. What's wrong, Marge?	David.
Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing.	Oh, Homie. Here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other.
They're forcing 'em.	Really, why?
He's awake!	Yessir!
Hey, yeah! Who are you? I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance...	I did go away, Mom! I was miles and miles and miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of Hell. And you were there! And you! And you! And you! You I've never seen before.
Ooo, classy.	It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.
Wow...	That's the downside. Now here's the good part. You can ching-ching-ching cash in on this tragedy.
Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office right now and...	Hey, Simpson, I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy.
Uh-oh...	Mr. Burns wants you to march into his office right now.
Nice to meet you too, sir.	Ah, Simpson! At last we meet.
A hundred bucks?	... One... Hundred... Dollars! Of course you'll have to sign a waiver, relinquishing your right to sue and so forth... merely a formality...
W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone...	A hundred bucks?
You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out.	Throw him out, Smithers.
Hey! Lionel Hutz...	You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out.
You sure have got some education, Mr. Hutz.	Tell them to sit tight. I'll get back to them. This way, Mr. Simpson.
Fifty percent?	Oh... oh well. Mr. Simpson, the State Bar forbids me from promising you a big cash settlement. But, just between you and me, I promise you, a big cash settlement. My fee is fifty percent.
Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.	You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson. You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace -- a $99 value -- as our gift to you.
Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!	A million dollars.
Whiplash! Oh no!	You see that dark spot there? Whiplash.
Yes, son.	Am I gonna die?
No, of course you're not going to die. Everything's fine!	Homer!
No!	Will I ever play baseball again?
Oh, Dr. Hibbert from Johns Hopkins Medical School?	That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine.
Just give me a ticket.	Thank you, your honor. Now, Bart, I want you to tell the jury, in your own words, exactly what happened on the day of the accident.
Oh, what? What is it?	Dad, may I please make an observation?
Don't mind if I do.	Oh, I don't like everything about them, just their heads. Well, would you care for some wine, old buddy?
Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?	Bottoms up Simpson, there's plenty more where that came from.
You mean duke it out?	Yes. Now then, Homer, old chum, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity. What do you say, we settle this man to man?
Five hundred thousand dollars!	Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all.
Well, Marge, what do you think?	Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose.
I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.	What do you think, Homer?
"""Five hundred thousand dollars."" I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars."	Oh, I feel faint..
Oh, the truth!	She sounded like she was taking that awful seriously.
Will that hold up in court?	"I'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
Oh, Marge.	But your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million? Well, we can't blame them for trying can we. Thank you very much, Mrs. Simpson.
Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. No, thank you.	Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you.	Some string beans?
No, thank you.	Some celery with cream cheese on it?
Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?	What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong.
I don't know if I'll ever come back here. Goodnight.	Sure.
Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in.	My woman's intuition is telling me something... I wonder what... Oh my god.
Moe, I wish he'd shut up.	Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't.
Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife.	And it's not even Ladies Night.
Oh, Marge...	Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.
No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.	We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--
I'm saying... She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. I'm not sure I love you anymore.	What are you saying, Homer?
Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.	Homer, look at me.
Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever.	Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.
Sorry to scare you like that, babe.	McBain!!
Is it done yet? Is it done yet?	Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!
Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four, three, two, one, ping!	Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.
We have meatloaf!	Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four, three, two, one, ping!
Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa.	Get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!
What are you getting at?	Thursday -- meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be.
What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.	Well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the...
Shut up, boy.	What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87.	Well, maybe Lisa's right. Tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?	Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere...
Fine. We'll go to Mars.	Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken.
No!	Please, Homer. Can't we try it?
If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?	Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both.
Oh, try me.	Nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time.
No.	Please, Dad.
No.	Please, Dad.
No!	Please, Dad.
No!	Please, Dad.
No!	Please, Dad.
Oh, okay, okay!	Please, Dad...please
Oh, okay. HELLO!	Please, do not be alarmed. Our chefs are just saying hello.
It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those.	Not today. And sir?
Good thing I'm open-minded.	No, no, no. Toshiro, the squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman. Hang your head in shame.
Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.	Good thing I'm open-minded.
I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one.	Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
Oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!	I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one.
... oh, oh, and two of these things.	"And I'd like to dedi-cate this next song to my wife, Patti. ""I WAS BORN IN THE WAGON OF A TRAVELLING SHOW / MAMA USED TO DANCE FOR THE MONEY THEY'D THROW / PAPA WOULD DO WHATEVER HE COULD..."""
And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe...	Two uni.
You're the doctor!	I recommend it with a raw quail egg on top.
There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!	Right on.
Come on, pal! Fugu me!	It is blowfish, sir. But I should warn you that one...
I want fugu!	Concentrate. Concentrate...
Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.	I want fugu!
Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?	Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
Oh, I couldn't possibly.	For God's sake, don't eat another bite!
Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!	Mr. Simpson-san. I shall be blunt. We have reason to believe you have eaten poison.
"""Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?"" I never heard of a poison pork chop."	Oh, no need to panic. There's a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.
No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.	Hmmm, your wife agreed that I should break this to you.
Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?	No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.
Twenty-four hours?	No, Mr. Simpson. If in fact, you've consumed the venom of the blowfish -- and from what the chef has told me, it's quite probable, you have twenty-four hours to live.
Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.	Well, twenty-two. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
No way! Because I'm not dying.	Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go through five stages. The first is denial.
Why you little --	The second is anger.
What's after fear? What's after fear?	And after that comes fear.
Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.	Bargaining.
Well, we all gotta go some time.	Finally, acceptance.
Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.	Well, we all gotta go some time.
So you're going to die... 	Mr. Simpson, your progress astounds me. I-I should leave you two alone. Perhaps this pamphlet will be helpful.
Hello, Marge? Hello? I'm the one who's dying, not you.	So you're going to die... 
Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.	I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?
Almost.	Well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?
I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know...	Almost.
Be intimate with Marge.	When we're intimate?
Ah, watch the sunrise.	Can I just make one suggestion? Can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?
Till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth.	Ah, watch the sunrise.
Eleven-thirty! Oh, that's just great.	Till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth.
Marge, why did you let me sleep so late?	Eleven-thirty! Oh, that's just great.
There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.	You looked so peaceful lying there.
Bart! Bart!	There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.
Have man-to-man with Bart.	Bart! Bart!
Come here, boy.	Have man-to-man with Bart.
Nooo, I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk.	Oh, man.
You know, Bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --	Oh.
"Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, ""cover for me."" Number two, ""oh, good idea, boss."" Number three, ""it was like that when I got here."""	Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?
...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.	Hey, this is good stuff.
Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.	...and, finally, the little spot under your nose.

Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.
Oh, Why you little --	Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
Oh, that's my boy.	It was like that when I got here.
Listen to Lisa play her sax.	Oh, that's my boy.
No. Let me hear you play.	Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?
Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?	Why?
"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE... OVER THERE."""	Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?
Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it?	Simpson, what a pleasant surprise. We were just pulling taffy.
Hey, Flanders, could I borrow your camcorder?	No-sirree-Bob!
No, thanks.	Okey-dokel. Hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?
No, I don't want-a...	Oh, are you sure? We got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard.
Flanders, I said I didn't -- Tomorrow? Sure, what the hey. I'd love to come to your barbecue. I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen.	Oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'.
Heh-heh. The joke's on him, I'll be dead by then.	Mmm Mm, sounds terriff!
I'm sorry, Officer. I know I was going too fast. Just give me a ticket.	Heh-heh. The joke's on him, I'll be dead by then.
This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie. Hi, Maggie. I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. Oooooooh. Hope that didn't scare you. Well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... He was a simple man. A kind man. A gentle man who loved his children and...	I beg your pardon?
Hello? Yeah he's here who is this? Bart's friend Milhouse. Bart! Get your butt down here!	This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie. Hi, Maggie. I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. Oooooooh. Hope that didn't scare you. Well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... He was a simple man. A kind man. A gentle man who loved his children and...
Dad --	Hello? Yeah he's here who is this? Bart's friend Milhouse. Bart! Get your butt down here!
Dad, we've never been too close, have we?	Huh? Oh, it's you. What do you want?
Never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other.	Not to my knowledge.
I just want you to know that I love you, Dad.	We never danced the Hoochy-Koo, either. What's your point?
Huh uh.	You do?
Dad!	Oh, son, I love you, too. Hey, how about a hug?
Papa!	Sonny boy!
My old man. Well, I gotta go.	Junior!
Well, gee, Dad, if I wasn't on such a tight schedule--	Oh, son, no. We've got a lotta catchin' up to do. What do you say... we go fishin'?
Well, I ... Oh, let's get some worms.	Well, gee, Dad, if I wasn't on such a tight schedule--
Well, no time for that.	Well, I ... Oh, let's get some worms.
Oh, I really wanted to do that one.	Well, no time for that.
Gee, Dad. Way to hog my last moments.	Oh, I really wanted to do that one.
Yeah, yeah. The old guy's a little love-starved.	I love you, son!
Get moving, you hunk of junk. I gotta make up for lost time.	Yeah, yeah. The old guy's a little love-starved.
"I pay my taxes and they pay your salary, so when I say ""give me a ticket"", just give me a ticket."	Whoa! Well, that sounded like an order.
That's sorta nice. What are you in for?	Hey, look what else your tax dollars pay for, huh.
Wait! I can't call Marge. It's our last day on earth together. I can't drag her into this mess. I know! I'll call Barney.	Okay, Flash. You get one phone call.
Damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!	Nobody's here... nobody's here... nobody'sherenobody'sherenobody's here...
Thanks a lot, Barney. I just wasted my one phone call on your stupid ma--	Damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!
You gotta help me, Barney. I'm in jail.	What? I'm home. I'm home. Hi, Homer.
Ju... ju....just get over here and bring fifty bucks for bail.	Hiya, neighbor. I can see you.
Hey, Barney, look. It was on my list, along with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss!	You're dyin' and you weren't even gonna stop at Moe's for a last beer with your buddies?
Hey, Burns! Eat my shorts!	Ring-a-ding-ding, sir.
Wow! Of all the luck! To think I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.	Simpson, eh? I want him in my office at nine o'clock Monday morning. We'll see who eats whose shorts!
I gotta call Marge.	Ah, Homer. Come on. You got time for one last beer. Please.
Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please.	Oh, wait a minute. Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket. When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew.
Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe.	Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please.
I love you, Barney.	Please, not in public.
Come on, Barney, I gotta get home.	Oh, how European.
Faster, Barney, faster.	Come on, Barney, I gotta get home.
Oh, I can't wait any longer. Hold on, Marge. I'm comin' home, baby.	I'm twirling as fast as I can.
Marge! Marge!	Oh, where can he be?
There's no time to explain.	Homer!
Love you. Love you. Love you.	There's no time to explain.
Okay, okay.	"I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer. It's called, ""To A Husband."""
Oh, gimme a break, Marge.	"Ahem. ""The blackened clouds are forming ..."""
That was beautiful.	"""... Soon the rain will fall / My dear one is departing/ But first please heed this call / That always will I love you / My one, my love, my all."""
Goodbye, Maggie -- stay as sweet as you are.	That was beautiful.
Goodbye, Lisa -- I know you'll make me proud.	Goodbye, Maggie -- stay as sweet as you are.
Goodbye, Bart -- I like your sheets.	Goodbye, Lisa -- I know you'll make me proud.
The Good Book...	Goodbye, Bart -- I like your sheets.
 ... on tape... 	The Good Book...
"""Oooo, as read by Larry King."""	 ... on tape... 
All right. Stop it! Cut it out!	His drool! It's warm! He's alive! Homer, Homer, wake up, you're alive!
What are you talking about?	Wake up! You're alive! You're alive!
I'm alive! I'm alive. And I couldn't be happier. From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!	You're alive!
Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or it'll hurt your eyes.	Well he's stepping up now and he needs to get at least a spare...
Oh yes it will.	Oh, it will not.
I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.	My mother. Real mature. I'm sick of your...
All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.	Dad, do something!
Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?	Looks like you lost the patient, Doc.
How's this?	No!
Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can.	Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out.
She's right! She's right!	I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!
Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!	She's right! She's right!
Bart!	You lie!
Ugh, gross. Ecch.	We were seniors in high school, but we had never even met.
SOME PEOPLE CALL ME A SPACE COWBOY / YEAH / SOME CALL ME THE GANGSTER OF LOVE / SOME PEOPLE CALL ME MAURICE. Woo woo / 'CAUSE I SPEAK OF THE PUPPETS OH OF LOVE.	Ugh, gross. Ecch.
English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Come on, let's go smoke.	Hey, Homer. You're late for English.
But we're early for lunch. Let's go grab a burger.	Oh, no! We're late for wood shop.
Eh, it's my metabmobolism. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones.	Boy, you never stop eatin' and you don't gain a pound.
Hey, don't worry Barney. It's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom.	Oooh, shot down again.
I... I don't know!	Hey, who's that?
She's mine!	Hey, would you like to go to the...
So, what are you in for?	She's mine!
Well, I'm here for being me. Every day I show up, act like me, and they slap me in here.	I'm a political prisoner. Last time I ever take a stand.
I haven't seen you in school before.	Simpson! Be quiet!
What?	Okay, Simpson.
Maybe we should get together some time.	You just bought yourself another day of detention!
I'm Homer.	I'm sorry, I don't even know your name.
J.	Three days!
Simpson.	Four days!
It was worth it.	Five days!
I'd reached step one: She knew I existed. The only problem was, she didn't care.	It was a jailhouse romance, man.
Nothing.	What's the matter, boy?
Dad, I'm in love.	You haven't said boo all night, and usually I have to wrestle the bucket out of your greasy mitts.
But, Dad, I don't drink...	Uh-oh. Why don't you grab yourself a beer, boy.
Uh-huh.	Now, this girlfriend of yours. Is she a real looker?
Oh, yeah.	A lot on the ball?
Thanks, Pop.	Ohhh, son, don't overreach. Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl. Ohh, I blame myself. I should have had this talk a long time ago.
Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I need some guidance, counselor.	Thanks, Pop.
Well, yeah, maybe, but I just met this girl, Marge Bouvier and I want to force her to like me.	Good Lord! Simpson, you should have come to see me a long time ago.
Oh.	That's not exactly the type of guidance I give.
Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?	Well, I like to think I do something helpful for every student N through Z. The only advice I can give you is, try to share a common interest and spend, spend, spend.
Far out!	Oh, I believe she's very active on the Forensics Team. They meet in the new building. Room two-nineteen.
Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.	Homer, do you have any plans for after graduation?
Me, in a nuclear power plant... Kaboom!	Oh, no, I meant career-wise. You know, that nuclear power plant will be opening soon. It's one of the few outfits around that won't require a college education.
My name's Homer Simpson. I'd like to sign up for something.	Well thank you, Artie.
Debate? Like, arguing?	Well, we have an opening on the Debate Team.
I'll take that, you stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein.	Yes.
Fifty-five! That's ridiculous! Sure, they'll save a few lives. But millions will be late!	"This year's topic is, ""Resolved: The national speed limit should be lowered to fifty-five miles per hour."""
No Way.	"Why don't you take ""con""?"
Ignoramus.	Our current speed limit is an anachronism. The fatuity...
Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --	Will you shut up?
Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?	Ignoramus?
Not to me there isn't!	There's a difference between ignorance and stupidity.
You ignoramus.	Homer,
No, you...	You're the ignoramus.
With pleasure.	Homer, would you like to present your rebuttal?
Hel-lo.	Aye Carumba!
Oh, you may not remember me. I'm Homer Simpson. I mooned for rebuttal.	Hello.
So... you wanna go out with me?	Yes, I remember.
Well, a... You see the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan, and ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumbel.	Well, I don't think you're my type.
Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair.	Hmm, I don't know.
Well, what's the good word?	Well put.
What?	I'm sorry.
I'm... a spare. Excuse me.	What?
What?	Well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but I really don't have the time.
Yeah, so....	And the City Forensics championship is coming up.
You tutor?	Oh, and I-I tutor part time.
And anyone can be tooted?	Yes.
French. What a coincidence. Just the subject I'm having trouble with.	Just those who need help with French.
Bart, pay attention. You may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks.	Great story. Positively spellbinding. Work, damn you, work!
Ooh, lost a few. Oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo.	Bart, pay attention. You may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks.
The perfect crime.	Ooh, lost a few. Oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo.
Hel - lo.	The perfect crime.
It helps me study. Heh-heh-heh.	Why is there make-out music on?
Cray-on.	Well, not me. Shut it off and let's get down to business.
Fenetre.	Bien.
Femme.	Bien.
Oh.... wait, Don't go. Don't go. Wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?	Tres bien. Well, I should probably be going. I have a big Forensics meet tomorrow.
Do the hustle!	Oh.... wait, Don't go. Don't go. Wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?
ALLOUETTE JAUNTE ALLOUETTE / ALLOUETTE JAUNTE...	"Homer, you're amazing. Before you couldn't say bon jour. But now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of ""Allouette""."
I can't believe it, it's sticking. You're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! And it's all thanks to you. Marge, when I see you forming the vowels and continents --	Yes. Thousands of them.
-- Consonants, with your beautiful mouth, and your beautiful breath pushing them past your beautiful teeth...	Consonants.
Marge, would you go to the prom with me?	Merci, I guess.
I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui.	You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension.
Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw.	Oui.
Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better.	Maybe I'll wear my hair... up.
Ow.	Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better.
Hey, Barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?	You knew the City Forensics finals are tomorrow. And you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. Homer J. Simpson, I hate you!
Is Marge here?	Ladies pinch. Whores use rouge.
I'm her date.	Who or what are you?
Oh, okay.	Mm-hmm. I suppose you want to come in and sit down.
Thanks, Mr. B.	You know, I usually insist on approving Marge's dates, but from what she's told me I'm sure you're a solid citizen.
You said you'd go to the prom with me.	What are you doing here?
I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope.	I also said I hated you and we haven't even talked since then.
She's with him.	Hey, buddy, where's your date?
Hey, I paid for this car. I paid for this tuxedo and I paid for the two dinners. We're going to the prom.	Ouch! So, I guess you want me to take you home?
You wish, Dondelinger.	Homer Simpson, I thought you dropped out.
One of each, please.	Steak or chicken?
Barney!	Comin' through.
Oh, isn't she great? Hail Queen Marge! Woo woo! Long live the Queen!	Children, we have tabulated your votes. The King and Queen of Springfield High School's Class of 1974 are -- Artie Ziff and Marge Bouvier!
I gotta get outta here.	Why do birds suddenly appear? Every time you're near!
What?	Homer?
Because I'm sure we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. Something says yes, something says no. But this time there's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?	Wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?
Inspiration Point.	Well, where to now, Romeo?
Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home.	Well, it's one o'clock. If you want to keep me, I'm afraid it's gonna be forty-five dollars an hour.
Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!	Will you stop it? She went out with the good one.
All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!	Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
Marge?	Homer.
Sure.	Yeah, you want a ride?
Who? Oh.	You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with.
Marge, pour vous.	My prom date.
I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.	Why so glum?
And I never have.	I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.
Huh?	That is the most dishonest thing I've ever heard.
Hey, Flanders. Who put that bug up your butt?	Hey, you easy. Now, get off my property! Off!
Boy, what's this world coming to?	Ohhh. I wanted to subscribe to that new Arts and Crafts Channel. Well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks.
Gotta go.	You know, that's exactly what I --
Hey, stop, cable man! Stop!	Gotta go.
I want free cable.	What do you want?
So You've Decided To Steal Cable.	What? Oh, hey, if you're having second thoughts, just read this pamphlet.
"""Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""	Uh-huh.
Cable. It's more wonderful than I dared hope.	"""Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""
It's funny 'cause it's true!	Don't you hate it... when you go to the bathroom and... there's no toilet paper?
Oh, hey, hey. Family, family, come here. I have an announcement to make. The Simpsons have cable.	It's funny 'cause it's true!
That's right. Sixty-eight channels. MTV for the kids. VH-1 for us. Sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!	Cable? / Us? / Wow! / We have cable!
Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that.	Homer, we talked about cable before. Do you really think we can afford it?
Don't worry, Marge. Take a look at this.	Are you sure this is legal?
Marge --	"""Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam."" Hmm, well, I don't know."
Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women.	Marge --
Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport.	"El Mummeo le pone en el ""Sleeper Hold"". Donde esta los medicos de Mexico?"
They must think people will watch anything.	Mr. Speaker, if I could call your attention to the Retroactive Subsidy Appropriations Override Bill. I refer you to page four thousand five hundred and...
Huh, wha'? Oh, okay.	Aren't you ready for church, Homer?
Oooh. Pizza.	Now today's Christian doesn't think he needs God. He thinks he's got it made. He's got his hi-fi... his boob tube... and his instant pizza pie...
Bart!	Hell.
The lad has a point.	Well, that's what we learned about. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?
Read the pamphlet, honey.	Dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?
Oh, goody! A program-length advertisements!	Read the pamphlet, honey.
Bart!	Beats the hell out of me.
Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?	Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?
Well, duh.	Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin.
Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?	But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.
And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?	No.
Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds.	No, I didn't.
Well, thank you honey.	Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.
Whooo!	Friday night, live from Las Vegas. The ultimate match-up. The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out.
Oh, boy!	It's Watson-Tatum II. This time, it's for money!
How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?	Only on the Blockbuster Channel.
We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.	Not too shabby! Whadda you say, Homer?
Pass the pumice, please.	We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.
Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all.	So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.
Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?	Ooh! Somebody's having a party.
Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.	Thank you, but this store is open twenty-four hours. It puts great demands on my time.
Bart!	Aye Carumba!
Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.	Blue chips closed up three and three quarters... Oil service stocks slumped slightly on news of OPEC's continuing stalemate at their meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.
Promise me.	Okay.
Good boy.	I promise I will never watch that channel again.
Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!	Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time.
There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium.	Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.
Unhook it?! But I love cable.	Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable.
Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.	Well, then maybe you should pay for it.
Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.	But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home.
...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.	No.
Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.	Oh, Homer.
It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken.	No, Homer, not over this. No, no.
Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?	Hey, Simpson!
Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.	Well, your door wasn't locked in any serious way. I wonder if you'd be interested in this car stereo? A five hundred dollar value, but I'll let you have it for forty bucks.
He's not home.	Well, maybe I'll go see your neighbor.
Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.	Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly.
Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...	It's a raid!
Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room.	Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
Oh great.	Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
Just a select circle of my friends.	Thank you, Barney. How many people are coming, Homer?
Oh, didja swipe those from work?	Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies.
Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs...	Hey, Homer, I brought ya...
All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!.	Hey!
Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.	Hey, Homer. I brought you a mug.
"Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I ""borrowed"" from work."	Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.
All right, the stuff I stole from work!	"Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I ""borrowed"" from work."
Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet.	Oh, okay.
Will you quit staring at me like that!	Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet.
Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?	We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
Yeah.	Are you Homer Simpson?
No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never...	Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hook-up.
Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.	We were, whoa, we were just wondering if we could watch the fight?
Oh, no.	For five years I was, I was incarcerated, away from my family and the mothers of my children. The conditions were irrevocable.
Marge, Lisa, Maggie...	Oh, no.
Come on, boy.	Shake hands. Keep it clean.
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you.	Come on, boy.
Yeah, at the worst possible time.	Dad, we may have saved your soul.
The greatest fight ever and I missed it.	Everyone to my place for blueberry Squishees and microwave burritos!
Cable clippers, please.	Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back.
Oops.	Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin...
Third time's the charm.	Oops.
Ooh! Barbecue!	All I wanted to tell you about WAS this new barbecue joint.
This is like some beautiful dream.	It's called Greasy Joe's Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit. I can still taste the sauce between my fingers. And are you ready for this? It's all you can eat!
Marge, honey, I've got five words to say to you. Greasy Joe's Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit.	One. And two. And three. And reach. And five. And six. And seven..
Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.	See me again tomorrow?
I'll take that bet.	Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.
I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me.	Patty! Selma! We're home.
Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law.	Marge, I need to speak with you alone.
Remember? Who could forget?	Homer? Do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?
But that was just an idle promise.	...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.
Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?	I want you to find a husband for my sister Selma.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched.	She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
But Marge...	It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
All right.	Homer, you will find her a man.
Okay.	And not just any man.
Hey! Why should she have a better husband than you do?	He should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...
Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.	Excellent.
Boy, a good man really is hard to find.	Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.
One seafood burrito, Apu.	Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats!
Sorry.	I am loathe to interrupt your meditation. But the time has come for money to change hands.
What is it this time?	Oh, sorry Principal Skinner. It must be a bad connection. It's for you. I think Bart's in trouble again.
But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?	I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.
But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?	Only to my job.
Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school.	Well, of course. These pants come off at night just like everyone else's. But tell me, why all the questions?
Excellent.	Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace. I'd be delighted!
Heh heh heh. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, Selma.	I... ah... muh... Be still my foolish heart.
Wha...?	Hey, Baldilocks, I'm Patty.
Oh yes, plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait.	Well, don't worry. There are still plenty of fish in the sea. Right, Homer?
Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma.	Lighten up, Homer. You're making Happy Hour bitterly ironic.
Like my wife's ugly sister.	I'm intrigued. What does this Selma look like?
Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know.	Homer, my sister is not going out with Barney Gumbel.
But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and simple.	Thanks kid. You made my day.
Oh, there's the little prom queen now.	But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and simple.
Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!	Can the sweet talk, you're right. It's time to ashcan my girlish hopes and dreams and grab hold of the next train out of the station.
Take it to the hoop, Selma.	It's time to give away my love like so much cheap wine.
... And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. Amen.	Don't you... tell... me... what to do... you... young... whipper... snap-per.
Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.	Is too.
Not one word.	Da-ad!...
I thought I said knock it off!	Not one word.
Well, no panta-ma-mime, either.	Not one word.
The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!	It's the hospital.
What is it, Da --	Pull your chair closer, my son.
Oh Dad, you and your imagination.	P.U.! Not that close! Ish. Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die someday.
A half-brother?	There's something I think you should know. Homer, you have a half-brother.
This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me.	What are you blubbering about?
I'm going to find my brother. I don't care what it takes. If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him!	Hmmm... Interesting theory.
Bart!	So, any idea where this bastard lives?
I guess he's got us there.	Well his parents aren't married, are they? It's the correct word, isn't it?
Bart!	Bart!
Twen... forty-eight. This is it.	BASTARD / BASTARD, BASTARD!
Excuse me, is this an orphanage?	Twen... forty-eight. This is it.
Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh brother, where art thou?!	Ooo, you're a little late, pal. They tore down the orphanage thirty odd years ago.
Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry.	Take it easy, buddy. They moved across the street.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wish I could help you but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name?	I myself have spent years searching for my long-lost twin brother --
Herbert. Herbert Powell. Great! Where can I find him?	Hmmm, according to our records, a Mr. and Mrs. Powell adopted your brother and named him Herbert.
Oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. Please...	I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to release that information.
I know, he could be anywhere! That's why I want you to narrow it down! Please...	Well, I do sympathize with your situation, Mr. Simpson. After all, your brother could be anywhere. Even Detroit.
Well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being I ever...	You know Mr. Simpson, if you ask me, the City of Brotherly Love isn't Philadelphia... it's Detroit.
Oh, oh... I get it. Okay. Here's twenty bucks. Now will you tell me where my brother lives?	Read between the lines, you fool.
Just take it and tell me!	Mr. Simpson, I don't want your --
Fine. Thank you.	Detroit. He lives in Detroit.
Let's see, Powell, Powell... Powell... Pomerant, Poole, Popkin, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randolph... whoops, too far. Here it is, Powell.	Fine. Thank you.
No, I've called all three Herbert Powells in Detroit. Nothing.	Any luck, Homie?
H! Of course. That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but...	Well, you want to try that H. Powell?
Hello, is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan?	Y'ello.
By any chance does the H stand for Herbert?	Yeah.
Woo woo! The H stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted?	Yeah.
From the Shelbyville Orphanage?	Yeah.
Because... ... I'm your baby brother, Homer!	How did you know that?
Hello? Hello? Hello? Stupid phone!	Because... ... I'm your baby brother, Homer!
Oh, sorry.	Hey, hey, knock it off! I'm here! I was just silent because of the emotion involved.
Okay, Brother! Grab the next plane to Springfield. We got a couch that folds out...	Homer, I think we need to get together.
Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further.	Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
But Marge, I want to see my brother--	Bart! Lisa! If you don't behave, we'll turn this car right around and go home.
Oh.	Oh for God's sakes, Homer, it's an empty threat.
That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge?	Did you know you were going... Oh, sorry, sir. I didn't know it was you.
What does it look like?	That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge?
Marge, this can't be the right address.	I have no roots. All I know is that, I'm just a... lonely guy.
Hello in there.	Marge, this can't be the right address.
Herb?	Homer?
Holy moly! The bastard's rich!	Homer! Homer! Welcome to my home, Brother!
Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is my wife, Marge...	Holy moly! The bastard's rich!
... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.	Thank you.
Yeah, though the boy was a close call.	All born in wedlock?
What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!	Oh, I'm afraid I wouldn't know how.
I feel the same about you.	God, that new-baby smell. Homer, you're the richest man I know.
Even pork chops?	While you're here, I want you to make yourselves right at home. Anytime you're hungry, anytime day or night, Cook will make you anything you want.
You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?	Absolutely. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room --
Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got this straight... It's Christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach...	We don't have a big one.
Will you kids shut up?	Polo!
Okay, we're watching.	Watch me dive! Watch me dive! Watch me dive!
Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!	Ohh, oh, got him.
Are you sure you want to give me a car?	Okay, Homer. Pick out any one you want.
Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.	Hey, you know what these things cost me? There's maybe forty bucks worth of steel in them.
Why not?	Dook on!
Well, then give me one with lots of pep.	Because Americans don't want big cars.
America.	Homer, tell the nice man what country you come from.
You do.	Do you hear that, you morons? This is why we're getting killed in the marketplace! Instead of listening to what people want, you're telling 'em what they want. Homer, I need your help.
And I want to let you!!	Yeah. I want you to help me design a car. A car for all the Homer Simpsons out there! And I want to pay you two hundred thousand dollars a year!!
Hi'ya, team.	Homer, meet my team of engineers. They're gonna build your car.
I dunno.	So, what kind of car would you like, Mr. Simpson?
What's that?	Nah.
All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?	The on-board computer.
Oh yeah, he did!	Mr. Simpson, your brother told you to help us with this car now, didn't he?
Oh, okay.	Hmmm hmmm, then why don't you get us some coffee.
Ugh, oh boy.	Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!
Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...	Hey Homer, how's your car coming?
Huh?	Homer...
Uh, yeah, I think I did.	You didn't ask for rack and pinion steering, did you?
Uh, may I be excused, please?	How could you ask for it? You don't even know what it is! You just called it rack and peanut steering.
Because you think I'm a genius?	No! Homer, do you know why I gave you this job?
Because you think I'm dynamic?	Nah, I don't think you're a genius.
You think I work well with others?	I don't think you're dynamic.
Oh, great.	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Homer, I gave you this job because you're an average schmoo.
Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.	All you need is a little self-confidence.
Sort of.	"Up...up...up. Listen to me, here's what you do. From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself, ""If I was ever sure of anything, I'm sure of this."" Do you understand?"
What?	Homer!
Sort of!	Answer me again with self-confidence.
All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!	Now go get 'em.
Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? The cup is this big!	Sir, the car has a beverage holder.
And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.	Extremely large beverage holder.
And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!	Little... ball.
"I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play ""La Cucaracha."""	Homer Simpson is a brilliant man with lots of well thought out, practical ideas. He is insuring the financial security of this company for years to come. Oh yes, and his personal hygiene is above reproach.
And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that.	"I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play ""La Cucaracha."""
You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?	Maybe a built-in video game would keep them entertained?
Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!	What about a separate sound proof bubble dome for the kids? With optional restraints and nuzzles.
No! No! No! No! No!	Now this is spoiling them.
All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way.	Ladies and gentlemen... esteemed stockholders... members of the press... your Holiness. Tonight, we are going to witness automotive history.
Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it.	Homer gets...
Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life.	Bye, Herb.
Ooo.	Maybe I would have been better off?! Maybe? Why, you spongehead, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother.
Get in, Dad. I'll explain on the way home.	I'm here! Now where's that millionaire chip-off-the-old-block I call Sonny-Boy?
What is it, boy?	Dad?
Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that.	I thought your car was really cool.
No! No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop it! No, not the sports section! No!	Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that.
Stupid dog.	No! No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop it! No, not the sports section! No!
No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food.	Stupid dog.
Marge, the dog is hungry!	Ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. I think you have the mumps. I'm calling Doctor Hibbert.
Yes, Master.	Well, then, feed him!
Y'ello.	You! Wandering mongrel! Get out of my Mom and Pop operation!
Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.	Simpson? This is Sylvia Winfield. That canine of yours is in my pool again. I'm calling the dog warden right now!
Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right --	There's only one family on this block... no, on earth... inconsiderate enough to let a monster like that roam free.
Hey Lenny, I need to leave early. Cover for me, will ya?	Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right --
Well, well. Mr. Universe takes a walk. Haw, haw!	Well, howdaly-do, Simpson? Gettin' a little exercise, eh? Good for you, pal. Oh, look at this old rascal! He's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? Isn't he? You're just a water monster.
Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... Assassins!	Mr. Universe, I wish!
Oooh! Oooh! How much? How much? How much?	Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates.
Yeah.	Well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. But sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself.
Y'ello, Hi, Lisa, what's wrong? The mumps? Oooh, the kissing disease! My little girl is growing up.	Arithmetic! Now before you know it, you will be back among your polygons, your hypotenuse, and your Euclidean algorithms. Now, you get rest now and have yourself a wowwipop.
"So what does my little girl want? What? Let me write this down. Copies of ""Teen Dream... Teen Scream... and Teen Steam Magazine."" Well, okay. You're the sickie. Goodbye, Lisa."	Yuck. Quit it, Dad.
Oh man, two dollars. Uh, I'll take these three... They're for my daughter.	Ew.
Assassins!	Sure they are.
Oh, a hundred and twenty-five bucks!	Assassins!
But I can't afford to...	Sometimes you gotta spoil yourself... spoil yourself... spoil yourself.
Okay, Flanders, you're the boss. Heh, heh, heh.	Simpson, I order you to buy those shoes!
Yep! Hee, hee. Read 'em and weep.	Whoa! Assassins!
Bart!	A hundred and twenty-five dollars!!
Well, you bought all those smoke alarms and we haven't had a single fire.	I thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
I've changed my mind. I decided I don't want these shoes.	Like a hose, your wrinkled highness.
Well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth.	Hey, wait a minute. What happened here?
Big cookie.	I'm sorry, sir. Our warranty doesn't cover fire, theft, or acts of dog.
Well, aloha!	Aloha.
The price is right.	Would you like a free sample?
Mmmm. Macamadamia nuts.	The price is right.
Oh, so that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win.	If you'd like to buy some, they're only a dollar each.
Property of Hom-er J. Simp-son. Hands off.	Oh, so that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win.
Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to...	MY QUILT! Six generations, gone.
No, MY COOKIE!	Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to...
This is not happening! This is not happening!	No, MY COOKIE!
Everybody in the kitchen! We're having a family meeting!	This is not happening! This is not happening!
We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.	We never had a family meeting before.
I'm saying...	Homer, what are you saying?
Bart!	No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!
You do? Ha ha, ha ha ha!	No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.
No.	All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?
Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey.	Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?
"No, we have to commit ourselves. Now take this down. ""Free to loving home. World's most brilliant dog. Says 'I love you' on command."""	Homer, can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test?
"Oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. Hear what? Oh, sure. C'mere, boy! Put that prowler down. Come here! Come on boy! Say it, boy! Say ""I love you"" for the nice man! I lub you. Good dog! Good doggie! Isn't that amazing? See you soon. Woooo! Wooo!"	Sniff that other dog's butt! See, he does exactly what I tell him.
Uh, you can pick him up tomorrow.	Oh, he'd be very happy at my farm. You know, people think only mules can pull carts. Impatient people think that, but patient people know better.
Dad, the next time we see you we'll do something more fun.	You son-of-a-bitch. Good show!
Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital.	Huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab.
My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?	Homer, that's terrible. We should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. You know, we'll be old someday.
Marge, what do we do?	Well...
Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?	Well, I think we better set an example.
No.	To the pony rides.
He can't ride ponies.	Bo-ring.
Oh, we saw that.	Well, I always enjoy the glass blower at Old Springfield Towne.
No, Bart. No!	The Museum of Barnyard Oddities.
I got it. The Springfield Mystery Spot.	That's gross.
Dad! It's the third Sunday of the month. You know what that means.	Yo, active wear... I need a price check on a wool shawl.
Oh, come on, Dad, I promise we'll have more fun this time. We're gonna see lions.	Go away.
Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh.	I can't go. It's my girlfriend Bea's birthday.
Well, Happy Birthday, Bea. She can come with us. Hey, there's room for all your friends in the car.	Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, right.	No, she's not invisible, you idiot. See, it's her birthday tonight.
Hey you kids, stop kicking the seat!	Yeah, right.
Well, let 'em sleep on their own time!	It seems that most of the animals are sleeping.
Bart, get out and push.	Homer?
I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.	I can tell she really cared for me. She didn't make me a pall bearer.
Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing.	Is someone talking to me? I didn't hear anything.
Yell-o.	Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson. By the way, old timer, I do wills. Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it. It looks just like a cigar! Isn't that something!
Whoo-hoo. It's Dad. Dad's on the phone. He's calling me.	Hello, Homer?
Oh Dad. Oh, I knew you'd forgive me.	Whoo-hoo. It's Dad. Dad's on the phone. He's calling me.
Huh?	Grampa!
Dad!	Huh?
Well... sure. We'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. Bart!	Is there room at your table for a foolish old man?
Pass the bug juice, Dad.	...couldn't buy me the pleasures of a simple family meal.
Bart! Forgive him, Dad. He's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing that pops into his head. But, you know, there's wisdom in his innocence.	Give it to us, Grampa.
Yes, I do.	You don't want it.
Miss, I'm looking for Abe Simpson.	Hey, mellow out old dudes, or I'll jam this baby into a river.
It's important I get a hold of him. I have to tell him I don't care about his money and I love him.	Huh uh.
Casino?	He left this morning with the senior casino junket.
A double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for God's sakes, hurry!	Change, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? He looks like me, but he's wrinkled? Hello, have you seen a...	Great! Put it on number twenty.
Dad! Noooooooooo!	Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? He looks like me, but he's wrinkled? Hello, have you seen a...
Holy Moly! You're winning!	Twenty, black.
Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. You understand that, take all your money and leave now.	Beat it, boy, you're crampin' my style.
But you could lose everything. Come on.	Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody.
You'll be a bonehead. Come on.	"Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: ""If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and everything that's in it. And -- which is more -- you'll be a man, my son."""
Dad, no! Gimme that.	Okay, put it all on thirty-six. I've got a feeling about that number.
Gimme me that money. Ow! You're hurting me.	Get your clammy paws off my money.
So, have you figured out who gets the money?	Son, you saved me from losing all my money. For the first time in my life I'm glad I had children.
If I take you, will you two SHUT UP AND QUIT BUGGING ME?	Me too.
YES!!!	Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
Heads up, kids. I'm moving the seat back.	Homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination.
All right, everybody stick together. We don't want to get separated...	It is back.
The hell with this.	No, Maggie! Stay in the shallow end.
Slide inspector comin' through! Please move to the right. Grab that handrail, young man. Outta my way, I'm here for your safety.	The hell with this.
Oh no! Urg... Arrrgh. C'mon you stupid tube!!!	Bitchin'.
OH NOOOOOO!!!!	Roger.
I... can't... breathe! Too... many... children...!	OH NOOOOOO!!!!
All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?	Now Kent, you know that question is out of bounds. This interview is over.
Well, am I?	All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?
Four Hundred and thirty-seven. Fifty-five. Oh my God, three hundred and... Hey, a hundred and fifty. Oh God, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big fat pig.	Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response.
Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone.	Now Homer, you do have big bones.
But I'm going on a diet. From this day forward I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again!	Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone.
Oh, shut up.	But I'm going on a diet. From this day forward I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again!
This old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. I said, isn't it, boy?	Oh, shut up.
Don't you ever do that to me again.	This old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. I said, isn't it, boy?
Bart!	Okay.
Get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.	Bart!
Ooh, the Glutimus Maximizer.	Hey, Homer, I found your weights.
Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr.	Hey, who's the moptop with the big schnozz?
Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute... Hey, what the...	Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr.
Marge!	Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute... Hey, what the...
Likely story.	Oh, Homer, don't be jealous. I was a schoolgirl, the Beatles were very popular and I had a crush on them.
Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?	Likely story.
Hello? Hello? Hello taste... where are you?	Now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece.
Hey, hey, now you're talkin'!	You can put a little something on top for flavor.
Do I have to do anything?	I think it's a very nice idea. Don't you, Homer?
Great, fine, go nuts!	No.
Mmm, only thirty-five calories.	Great, fine, go nuts!
I can't move, boy.	The Heavy Hands don't work unless you move, Homer.
"Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! ""Last Supper"", eat your heart out!"	Yay, Mom!
Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!	Shut up.
Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!	Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
What a family.	You look mahvelous.
Honey, I'm home!	Now you! Paint!
Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you in the other room?	I'm painting his portrait, Homer.
Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please...	Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you in the other room?
All right, all right, who took the funny pages?	Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.
All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!	All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right.
Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.	All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.	Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari.
No. Burns is right. What's the use?	Homer, what are you doing?!
Marge.	Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.
Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.	I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.
What?! Marge, you have to.	I don't think I can.
Hello, what's this?	I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
It's for you, Marge. From merry old England.	Hello, what's this?
A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!	"Yesterday, he read us ""Charlotte's Web"", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears."
Wow! You made the front page.	That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?	Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest.
Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?	Sure, why not?
Now, go get 'em.	Hm, yeah.
The Museum!	Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her.
"Tomorrow... ugh	 oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge."	Hmmm huh.
Shut up, boy.	Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart.
Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. Lousy brain.	Homer, please.
"Hey, what do you mean by, ""Suggested Donation""?"	Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. Lousy brain.
"And what if I ""wish"" to pay zero?"	Pay any amount you wish, sir.
Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?	Then it's up to you.
I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!	Yes.
Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!	Hi, Lisa.
Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man.	Ewww. Gross.
She said that?	Mr. Simpson... I'm gonna be presumptuous. I have noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
"But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """	Well, no, she didn't say it, but, you know, she...
Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A.	Mr. Simpson, you have got to be a bigger man. There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.
Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.	I am giving her an A.
You are smooth. I'll give you that.	Mr. Simpson, she did earn it.
